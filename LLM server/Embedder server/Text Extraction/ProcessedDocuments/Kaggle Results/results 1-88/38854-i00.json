            "description": "5G NR operating in millimeter wave bands (i.e., Frequency Range 2) is recognized as the technology capable of providing ultra-high data-rate transmission, thanks to the availability of enormous amount of bandwidth in FR2 and the advanced 5G NR design for FR2 beamforming-based operation. Inspired by the successful commercial FR2 deployment globally, more potential 5G NR deployment scenarios in FR2 draw attentions from the industry. Among those scenarios identified, high speed train (HST) scenario has the special importance, because of the fast expanding HST systems worldwide deployed and the great demands of high-speed connections from passengers and HST special services. This triggers the new and challenging demand for 5G NR FR2 HST scenario.\nIn existing study and work items led by 3GPP RAN4 (for either LTE or NR), high speed train scenarios under consideration has the operating bands up to 3.5GHz, however no existing works studied the more challenging millimeter wave frequency range 2, in which Doppler shift and Doppler spread will be further severe (e.g., for 240km/h with 28GHz, the Doppler shift is about 6.22kHz) and more challenging to radio resource management. Specifically, the existing FR2 RRM and demodulation requirements has not yet taken into account the impact of high speed in the above-mentioned scenario, where the channel model and mobility scenario need further study and the demodulation, measurement, mobility and beam management related requirements require to be further specified.\nIt should be noted that user equipment considered in 5G NR FR2 HST scenario is vehicle-roof mounted customer-premises equipment (CPE), which are expected to communicate with track-side deployed gNBs for the backhaul link and to further provide on-board broadband connections to user terminals and/or for other train-specific demands as access link.\nThis work will specify NR UE RF requirements, UE RRM requirements and BS/UE performance requirements for high speed train scenario with up to 350km/h in Rel-17.\n\n",

                    "text_content": "This section includes the agreed scenario and RRH parameters to be used in the investigated FR2 HST deployments. It captures the agreement and conclusions made during the work on FR2 HST deployment scenario and related aspects. Following figure 5.1-1 illustrates the definition of the different used D-values.\nFigure 5.1 -1 illustrates the D-values utilized on RAN4 work, showcasing the varying degrees of delay spread (D-values) that impact the performance of a radio access network (RAN). The figure presents a range of D-values, from 0.1 to 100 milliseconds, and their corresponding effects on the RAN's capacity and reliability. The visual representation helps in understanding how different levels of delay spread can affect the network's ability to handle traffic and maintain quality of service. The figure is essential for network designers and engineers to optimize RAN performance based on the specific D-value requirements.\nFigure 5.1-1 Illustration of the D-values used on RAN4 work.\n\nGeneral deployment parameters:\nRAN4 will at least consider the following general deployment for open-space scenarios:\n-\tDs and Dmin: Take the 5 scenarios in table 5.1-1 as basic assumption; and\n-\tScenario 1 and 4 shall be considered with high priority; and\n-\tDmin for [5m, 20, 30 and 50 meters] if found to be necessary; and\n-\tDRRH_height: 15m as basic assumption, [10,20m] if found to be necessary; and\n-\tDUE_height: 5m.\n\n\nRAN4 will at least consider the following assumptions for the deployment in the tunnel scenario:\n-\tDs and DUE_height are considered similar as in open-space deployment in Scenario 2 and 4, i.e., Ds=700m and DUE_height =5m; and\n-\tDmin and DRRH_height are constrained by the tunnel (e.g, dimension, shape, etc), and shall be smaller than values for open space scenario;\n-\tDmin: 1m; and\n-\tDRRH_height: 5.3m for one-track tunnel and 7.4m for two-track tunnel as the baseline assumption. The one-track tunnel shall be considered with higher priority.\n\nSub-Carrier Spacing (SCS):\nIt is still open which SCS options to consider. The options are:\n-\tOption-1: SCS = 120kHz; and\n-\tOption-2: Consider both SCS = 120kHz and 60kHz.\nConcerning the transmissions schemes following schemes were discussed in distinguished:\n-\tJT: Joint Transmission scheme applied for all channel (SSB, TRS, PDCCH, PDSCH) – Full SFN; and\n-\tDPS: Dynamic Point Selection based on the Rel-15 beam management (BM) principles; and\n-\tMulti-DCI based Multi-TRP transmission based on the Rel-15 eMIMO principles.\nAmong these the following down selection has been agreed:\n-\tFor Rel-17 WI discussion, FR2 HST transmission schemes which are not compatible with Rel-15/16 NR are precluded; and\n-\tFor Rel-17 WI discussion, Joint transmission (JT) used for FR2 HST, only full SFN is considered; and\n-\tFor Rel-17 WI discussion, Multi-DCI based multi-TRP transmission is precluded.\nRAN4 primarily consider HST FR2 deployment with\n-\tOne train moving over one railway track in one direction. RAN4 focuses on 1 direction 1 train. If this opposite direction is completely symmetric, the 1 direction study can apply directly; and\n-\tRRHs are located on one side of the track.\nDedicated network for roof-mounted CPE:\n-\tRAN4 to assume that in HST FR2 Scenario A, only high-speed CPEs installed on the roof of the train can be present in the network.\nRAN4 did comparison between unidirectional and bi-directional RRH deployments for Scenario-A and concluded that from signal strength and beam coverage perspective the bi-directional deployment will not provide significant throughput improvement compared to unidirectional deployment. This conclusion is based on the deployment scenario analysis. RAN4 will only consider unidirectional deployments for Scenario-A. Bi-directional deployment can be considered if the feasibility issue of unidirectional deployment is identified.\nRAN4 assume that FR2 HST with CPEs is operated as dedicated network. Hence, assumption in RAN4 is that in HST FR2 Scenario A and B, only high-speed CPEs installed on the roof of the train can be present in the network. There is no need to differentiate roof-mounted CPE from other FR2 UEs in HST FR2 scenario.\nRAN4 will not consider curvature when defining the requirements.\nRAN4 assumed that uni-directional and bi-directional RRH deployments can be considered for tunnel scenario, in which single-panel reception UE and DPS transition scheme shall have higher priority. RAN4 also agreed that multi-panel reception may also be considered in the HST FR2 tunnel scenario to alleviate potential mobility issues that may occur inside the tunnel.\n",

The following large scale pathloss models are proposed to be considered as candidate options:\n-\tOption-1: TR38.901 RMa LoS (baseline option); or\n-\tOption-2: free space model; or\n-\tOption-3: TR38.901 UMa LoS.\nTS38.901 RMa LoS pathloss model will be used for link budget evaluation at least for scenario 2 in table 5.1-1.\nRAN4 to choose TS38.901 RMa LoS pathloss model also for the evaluation of Scenario 4 in table 5.1-1.\nFor the purpose of demonstrating and validating which large scale channel modeling is suitable for FR2 HST, the analysis has been provided based on the practical field measurement. Specifically, based upon the conditions provided in the Table 6.2.1-1, the practical field testing on a trait along a typical railway has been conducted to obtain measurement data at the frequency of 28GHz, as illustrated in the Figure 6.2.1-1.\nTable 6.2.1-1 Parameters for practical field measurement for typical high speed train scenario\n\nFigure 6.2.1-1 illustrates a practical field measurement conducted for a typical high-speed train scenario. The diagram depicts the train's motion along the track, with various elements such as the train itself, the track, and the surrounding environment. The measurement captures the train's speed, distance, and time, providing valuable data for analyzing the train's performance and safety. The figure highlights the importance of precise timing and synchronization in high-speed rail systems, as well as the need for accurate measurements to ensure passenger comfort and safety.\nFigure 6.2.1-1 Illustration of practical field measurement conducted for typical high speed train scenario\n\nBy having the analysis based on the measurement data obtained from the measurement campaign as above described, the comparison among measurement results and pathloss models (i.e., the three options of RMa LOS, UMa LOS and free space model) is demonstrated in Figure 6.2.1-2 and accompanying Table 6.2.1-2 in which the numerical results are contained.\nFigure 6.2.1-2 compares measurement data and pathloss models for FR2 High-Speed Transceivers (HST). The graph illustrates the relationship between distance and signal strength, with different models predicting the attenuation of signals over various distances. The visual representation helps in understanding the accuracy of the models in predicting real-world scenarios, which is crucial for designing and optimizing wireless communication systems.\nFigure 6.2.1-2 Comparison of measurement data and pathloss models for FR2 HST\nBy leveraging the numerical results in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE), mean error and standard deviation (Std), it has been demonstrated that for the evaluated range there is no significant difference from three different pathloss LoS models, and the field measurement also validate that LoS model can reflect the practical FR2 HST channel condition compared with NLoS models. By further investigating three LoS models’ similarity from measurement data, it has been demonstrated that RMa LoS model can achieve the lowest value of RMSE and best mean error with reasonable standard deviation.\nTable 6.2.1-2 Numerical comparison of measurement data and pathloss models for FR2 HST\n\nBased upon the above analysis on the measurement data from the typical railway environment for 28GHz, it has been demonstrated that TS38.901 RMa LoS model is an accurate large-scale pathloss model and it is agreed that TS38.901 RMa LoS pathloss model is adopted to be used for link budget evaluation at least for Scenario-A.\nEditor Note: FFS pathloss model and Scenario-B.\nPathloss and channel model for tunnel deployments\nIf DRRH_height > DUE_height and assuming that there are no obstacles between the RRH and CPE, then LoS paths should always exist for the propagation inside the tunnel. Note that, different to open-space scenarios, contribution of the scattering and reflection paths in the received signal power are expected to be more significant in the tunnel propagation due to the impact of waveguiding effects. Nevertheless, since the beamforming is used in HST FR2 deployment, and in addition to the fact that the LoS path has shortest travel distance compared to scattering and reflection, the strong LoS path assumption should remain valid in the HST FR2 tunnel deployment scenario, and thus the LoS pathloss model can be used for the link budget analysis.\nTS38.901 RMa LoS model, which is considered in open-space link budget analysis, can be reused in tunnel scenario. On the other hand, it is also worth noting that RMa LoS model does not capture the effects of rich reflection and scattering that likely exist in the tunnel propagation. From this viewpoint, other pathloss model such as TS38.901 UMa LoS and UMi street cayon LoS channel model might be more relevant for link budget study in the tunnel scenario as those models somewhat included the impact of reflection and scattering propagation in the pathloss.\nAs mentioned above, the LoS condition can be considered for most of the areas between the serving RRH and neighboring ones. However, there may be exception in the area under the serving RRH where the serving beam cannot provide coverage directly. Different to the open space scenarios, channel condition w.r.t. the serving RRH in its shadow area is likely NLoS in tunnel due to the rich of the diffuse reflection paths. Nevertheless, from the mobility performance perspective, the impact of such NLoS condition on the HST FR2 deployments may be minor. More specifically, the signal level of the NLoS paths may be rather low as the result of high-order reflections. In addition, the shadow area under the RRH is small in tunnel scenario, which is few meters from the RRH since DRRH_height is close to DUE_height. For example, given the deployment parameters for single-track railway, the NLoS region could be within the radius of 5 meters from the BS, for which the train takes 50 ms to travel. This means that network may not be able to react timely to the measurement report, if available, for this NLoS area. Therefore, the impact of NLoS propagation under the RRH on the mobility performance, if exists, can be negligible.\nRay-tracing simulation results conducted in RAN4 studies [R4-2219289] and [R4-2302152] demonstrated that pathloss model in tunnel might have similar characteristics compared to urban open space scenarios; and pathloss at locations under the Tx is lower than that in open-space scenario; and multi-path components (MPCs) extensively exist but delay spread is small making MPCs indistinguishable from each other. These observations confirm the analysis that LoS propagation model can be used in the tunnel.\n",

Depending on whether or not joint transmission is allowed for FR2 HST, it could be possible to have multiple taps from neighboring RRHs, while if only DPS is allowed single tap model should be employed.\nFurthermore, whether or not the single tap is accurate enough for a single TX-RX link in FR2 HST scenario has been studied. Specifically, a measurement-data-calibrated FR2 HST ray-tracing model is used to simulate various paths of LoS and reflected path for a practical railway scenario. As required by WID, the UE is mounted on top of the driver’s cabin of the train in the simulation. And the traveling length is 2000 m, with a sampling distance of 20 m, thus making 200 snapshots (UE locations) be simulated.\n\nFigure 6.2.2-1 illustrates the setup for a FR2 HST ray-tracing simulation, showcasing the arrangement of the transmitter, receiver, and surrounding environment. The transmitter, represented by the green dot, emits signals in the FR2 band, while the receiver, depicted by the red dot, captures and processes the received signals. The surrounding environment, including buildings and other obstacles, is represented by the blue and gray shapes, simulating the complex propagation conditions in a real-world scenario. This simulation aims to analyze the performance of the system under various environmental conditions, providing valuable insights for optimizing the design and deployment of future wireless communication systems.\nFigure 6.2.2-1 Illustrative of the setup for FR2 HST ray-tracing simulation\nFor each given UE location, the received signals from 4 RRHs are simulated by using the ray-tracing model. Numerically, it has been demonstrated that all simulated snap shots have the ratio of received non-first-tap power over total received power smaller than 0.01, or in other words, in all snap shots, the first tap can contain more than 99% of the energy, which validate the single-tap assumption from a single TX-RX link in FR2 HST.\nFigure 6.2.2-2 illustrates the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the ratio of non-first-tap power over total power in a telecommunication system. The CDF curve shows the probability that the ratio of non-first-tap power to total power is less than or equal to a given value. This information is crucial for understanding the performance of the system, as it helps to identify the likelihood of certain power ratios occurring. The CDF curve is a useful tool for analyzing the distribution of power ratios and can be used to make informed decisions about the system's performance and potential improvements.\nFigure 6.2.2-2 CDF of the ratio of non-first-tap power over total power\nBased on measurement-data-calibrated ray-tracing modeling at 28GHz for typical railway environment, it has been validated that the single-tap is accurate enough to represent a single TX-RX link for FR2 HST. Therefore, it is agreed that for channel modelling for performance requirement, the single-tap can be assumed for a single TX-RX link at least for Scenario-A.\n\nEditor Note: FFS multi-tap models are needed for SFN and other scenarios and FFS channel model for Scenario-B.\nFor channel modelling for performance requirement evaluation:\n-\tSingle-tap can be assumed for a single TX-RX link at least for scenario 2 in table 5.1-1.\nRAN4 agreed that for both uplink and downlink the cosine of angle θ(t) used in Doppler shift in channel model is applied. This applies for:\n-\tA particular uni-directional deployment scenario; and\n-\tA particular bi-directional deployment scenario.\nThe single tap propagation model can be assumed for each single Tx-Rx link for both scenario 2 and scenario 4 in table 5.1-1\nRAN4 agreed that the uplink and downlink channel model in uni-directional deployments one channel model (either toward to serving beam or away from serving beam) is applied for demodulation requirement even if UE can travel in two directions in practice.\nRAN4 will use the following HST-DPS channel model as a starting point for FR2 HST uni-directional RRH deployment:\n-\tUE is moving towards the serving beam\n-\tThe cosine of angle θ(t) used in Doppler shift  is provided as\n-\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(1)\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(2)\nWhere:\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(3)\nThe Ds_offset value for introducing performance requirements is 10m and 100m for Scenarios A and B, respectively. The Ds_offset value has no restriction concerning deployments and the value is only used for developing the demodulation requirements. The Ds_offset is derived from the worst case based on analysis of deployment scenarios. Note, demodulation simulation assumptions should cover at least one Doppler shift jump region.\nRAN4 decided regarding the HST FR2 channel model in bi-directional deployment to use option 2 with DPS based channel model as starting point and based on this RAN4 agreed to use the following cosine values for the different schemes 2a – 2c below.

                            "text_content": "RAN4 discussed the Rx beam number for RRM requirements definition and agreed to define two sets of enhanced RRM requirements in terms of the number of Rx beams (i.e., Rx beam sweeping scaling factor) per UE:\n-\tSet 1: 2 Rx beams\n-\tSet 2: 6 Rx beams\nSet 1 is more relevant to the deployments where the RRHs are located next to the railway track, e.g., like in Scenario-A with Dmin = 10m. Whereases, Set 2 can be used in the scenarios where RRHs are further away from the track, e.g., like Scenario-B with Dmin=150m.\nThe analysis below is based on the system-level simulations carried out following the assumptions and parameters from Table 6.3.8.1-1.\nIt was found out that in priority scenarios additional beams oriented upwards (i.e., up from the horizontal plane parallel to the railways track) do not provide meaningful pefromance gains. Therefore, the analysis below is focusing only on the beams with different orientations in the horizontal plane.\nFollowing the antenna panel parameters from the Section 6.1, the half-power width for the RRH boresight beam is around 12.6 degrees (8x8 panel). Whereas the half-power width of the UE boresight beam is around 26 degrees (4x4 panel).\nThe considered deployment is uni-directional Scenario-A where the train is traveling in the direction opposite to the serving beam as presented in Figure 6.3.2.1.1-1. It is assumed that the RRH panel is oriented towards the projection of the following RRH on the railway track, and only one beam is used per RRH panel. The UE panel boresight is parallel to the railway track.\nFigure 6.3.2.1.1-1 illustrates a high-speed train (HST) frequency range 2 (FR2) uni-directional deployment, where the train is moving towards the serving beam. The figure depicts the train's movement along the track, with the serving beam's direction indicated by the arrow. The deployment showcases the alignment of the train with the beam, ensuring optimal signal reception and communication. The illustration highlights the importance of precise beamforming and positioning in providing reliable and high-speed connectivity for mobile communication systems, such as those used in railway networks.\nFigure 6.3.2.1.1-1: HST FR2 Uni-directional deployment, the train is moving towards the serving beam.\nIn Figure 6.3.2.1.1-2, simulation results (cumulative distribution function of SINR) are shown when only one Rx beam with fixed orientation is configured at the UE. It can be seen that the beam co-oriented with the UE panel’s boresight (RxBeams1-90) provides the highest SINR.\nFigure 6.3.2.1.1-2 presents a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of Signal-to-Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) for various orientations of a single receive beam in a telecommunication system. The CDF curve illustrates the probability of SINR values for different beam directions, providing insights into the system's performance under different antenna configurations. The figure is essential for optimizing the beamforming process and ensuring reliable communication in the presence of interference.\nFigure 6.3.2.1.1-2: CDF of SINR for different orientations of a single Rx beam.\nNext, a scenario where multiple Rx beams can be used at the UE side is considered. In Figure 6.3.2.1.1-3, it is demonstrated that no gain from using more than one boresight beam (i.e., the beam 90) is observed even if all of the additional beams are oriented towards the RRH.\nFigure 6.3.2.1.1-3 presents a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of Signal-to-Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) for various numbers of receive beams in a telecommunication system. The CDF curves are plotted for three different scenarios: 1) 1 Rx beam, 2) 2 Rx beams, and 3) 3 Rx beams. The x-axis represents the SINR values, while the y-axis represents the probability of occurrence. The CDF curves show the likelihood of achieving a certain SINR value for each scenario, illustrating the impact of the number of receive beams on the overall system performance. The figure highlights the trade-off between the number of beams and the SINR distribution, providing insights into the optimal configuration for a given telecommunication system.\nFigure 6.3.2.1.1-3: CDF of SINR for different number of Rx beams.\nA scheme of uni-directional deployments in HST FR2 Scenario-B is shown in Figure 6.3.2.1.2-1. We also indicate the orientation of Tx beams at RRH and Rx beams at CPE used in the simulations.\nFigure 6.3.2.1.2-1 illustrates the schemes of uni- and bi-directional deployments in High Speed Train (HST) Frequency Division Duplex (FR2) Scenario-B with the orientation of Tx and Rx beams. The figure showcases the arrangement of transmit and receive antennas, highlighting the directional nature of the communication system. The uni-directional deployment focuses on a single direction of signal transmission, while the bi-directional deployment enables communication in both directions. The figure emphasizes the importance of antenna positioning and orientation in achieving efficient and reliable communication in high-speed environments.\nFigure 6.3.2.1.2-1: The schemes of uni- and bi-directional deployments in HST FR2 Scenario-B with the orientation of Tx and Rx beams.\nFrom Figure 6.3.2.1.2-2 it can be noticed that increasing the number of Tx beams on RRH side provides very minor gain in HST FR2 uni-directional Scenario-B if only one Rx beam is used. Indeed, in this case, the CPE stays mostly in the coverage area of the boresight Tx beam, and additional beams are not used much.\nFigure 6.3.2.1.2-2 illustrates the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) in a uni-directional scenario for different numbers of transmit beams when only one receive beam parallel to the track is utilized. The figure showcases the impact of beamforming techniques on signal quality, with varying beam numbers (1, 2, 4, 8, 16) and their corresponding CDFs. The CDF curves indicate the probability of achieving a certain SINR level, providing insights into the system's performance under different beam configurations. The figure highlights the trade-off between beam number and signal quality, with more beams potentially leading to better SINR but also increased complexity and potential interference.\nFigure 6.3.2.1.2-2: SINR CDF in uni-directional Scenario-B for different number of Tx beams when only one Rx beam parallel to the track is used.\nFirstly, the scenario where one boresight Tx beam is used at the RRH and one Rx beam is used at the UE is considered. Different UE Rx beams directions are compared in Figure 6.3.2.1.2-3. The results demonstrate that Rx beam orientation has a significant impact on performance. For example, wrong orientation of Rx beam (e.g., to the other side from the RRH) results in the significant loss of performance. It was also found that Rx beam oriented 10-15 degrees from the UE panel boresight towards the RRH (i.e., RxBeams1-80, RxBeams1-75) provide best performance in Scenario-B.\nFigure 6.3.2.1.2-3 illustrates the L1-RSRP traces of serving RRH (top) and SINR CDFs (bottom) in a uni-directional Scenario-B for different orientations of Rx beams. The figure showcases the impact of beam orientation on signal quality and coverage, with measurements taken from various angles. The top graph displays the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of the serving RRH, while the bottom graph represents the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) values. The results reveal how beam orientation affects the received signal strength and the likelihood of achieving a certain SINR threshold, providing valuable insights for optimizing network performance and coverage in real-world scenarios.Figure 6.3.2.1.2-3 presents the L1-RSRP traces of the serving RRH (top) and the SINR CDFs (bottom) in a uni-directional Scenario-B for various orientations of the receiving beams. The figure illustrates the impact of beam orientation on signal quality and coverage, with measurements taken from different angles.

These results are shown in Figure 6.3.2.1.2-4. Like in Figure 6.3.2.1.2-2, one can observe that adding more Tx beams when only one Rx beam parallel to the track is used does not provide significant gain. However, if we orient the Rx beam more towards the RRH, then in the areas next to the RRH the received signal power can be significantly increased.\n\nFigure 6.3.2.1.2-4 illustrates the L1-RSRP traces of the serving RRH (top) and the SINR CDFs (bottom) in a uni-directional Scenario-B with multiple Tx beams and different orientations of Rx beams. The figure showcases the performance of a network under various conditions, highlighting the impact of beamforming and antenna orientation on signal quality and coverage. The top graph displays the L1-RSRP values, which represent the signal strength at the receiver, while the bottom graph presents the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), indicating the probability of achieving a certain SINR level. The figure demonstrates the importance of optimizing beamforming and antenna configurations to ensure reliable and high-quality communication in a wireless network.\nFigure 6.3.2.1.2-4: L1-RSRP traces of serving RRH (top) and SINR CDFs (bottom) in uni-directional Scenario-B with multiple Tx beams and for different orientations of Rx beam.\nFinally, the scenario where multiple (four) Tx and multiple (up to four) Rx beams are configured together is analyzed (Figure 6.3.2.1.2-5). It is shown that the correct choice of Rx beams improves the received signal strength in the areas where the coverage of additional Tx beams is present. The median value of the SINR can be increased for around 4 dB. One can also notice that the use of 2 and 3 Rx beams provide significant gains, whereases the gain from more additional beams (e.g., 4 in total) is not significant.\n\nFigure 6.3.2.1.2-5 illustrates the L1-RSRP traces of the serving RRH (top) and the SINR CDFs (bottom) in a uni-directional Scenario-B with four Tx and multiple Rx beams. The figure showcases the performance of the network under different conditions, providing valuable insights into the signal strength and coverage. The top graph displays the L1-RSRP traces, which measure the signal strength at the receiver, while the bottom graph presents the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), indicating the probability of achieving a certain SINR level. The figure highlights the importance of optimizing beamforming and resource allocation to ensure reliable and efficient communication in a multi-beam environment.\nFigure 6.3.2.1.2-5: L1-RSRP traces of serving RRH (top) and SINR CDFs (bottom) in uni-directional Scenario-B with four Tx and multiple Rx beams.\n\n",

In the following sub-section, companies’ evaluation results are provided for information, which are used as the technical basis to derive the conclusion.\nFor Scenario-A, uni-directional and bi-directional deployment, Samsung provide the evaluation in the contributions R4-2110234 and R4-2113170 respectively.\nAs provided in clause 6.2 for the detailed simulation assumption and the detailed beam configuration in Table 6.3.3.1.1-1, it has been shown that with 1 beam per RRH panel and 1 beam per UE panel, the link budget performance is satisfactory, in terms of at least ~30dB margin over FR2 PC4 REFSENS requirement and at least ~21dB margin over FR2 PC4 spherical coverage requirement, as illustrated in following figure. Even considering 31dBm for TX power is a bit optimistic assumption for 8x8 panel configuration (e.g., with per element P_out = 12dBm and 3dB polarization gain, 8x8 panel can achieve 12 + 10log(64) + 3 = 34dBm without considering any implementation margin), the cellular coverage should still be satisfactory with implementation margin considered.\nFigure 6.3.3.1.1-1 illustrates the received signal power without user equipment (UE) RX beamforming in a uni-directional scenario, showcasing the impact of antenna gain and antenna directivity on signal strength. The figure depicts the transmit power from the base station (BS) and the received power at the UE, emphasizing the importance of beamforming techniques in enhancing signal quality and coverage.\nFigure 6.3.3.1.1-1 RX power without UE RX beamforming, Scenario-A, Uni-directional\nNext, we take UE RX beamforming gain into account, and assume 1 beam per panel (which is existing agreement in R4-2106100). For simplicity, it is assumed that UE boresight direction is opposite to RRH boresight direction (i.e., the largest UE beamforming gain is achieved when UE is located at the projection point of the neighboring RRH on the railway). It is shown in the following figure, with UE RX beamforming gain into account, the received signal power after RX beamforming is no less than -50dBm even for the nearest coverage point (which is corresponding to least RX beamforming gain around 15dB), which also should be regarded as satisfactory link performance.\nFigure 6.3.3.1.1-2 presents a detailed analysis of the received power with user equipment (UE) RX beamforming in a uni-directional scenario. The figure illustrates the impact of various factors on the received power, including the distance between the base station (BS) and the UE, the antenna gain, and the beamforming gain. The graph shows that the received power increases with the distance, but the rate of increase decreases as the distance becomes larger. This is due to the fact that the signal strength decreases with distance, and the beamforming gain helps to compensate for this decrease. The figure also shows that the received power is higher when the UE is closer to the BS, which is expected since the signal has to travel a shorter distance. Overall, the figure provides valuable insights into the factors that affect the received power in a uni-directional communication scenario.\nFigure 6.3.3.1.1-2 RX power with UE RX beamforming, Scenario-A, Uni-directional\nThe evaluation and analysis above is based on the parameters provided in clause 6.1, while some of additional used assumptions are summarized in the below Table:\nTable 6.3.3.1.1-1 Additional Assumptions for Uni-directional RRH Deployment Link Performance Evaluation\n\nTwo candidate schemes for Bi-directional deployment for Scenario-A are discussed, and the illustration of two scheme are captured in WF R4-2106100 for information, i.e.,\n-\tScheme-1: Connecting to 2nd-Nearest RRH;\n-\tScheme-2: Connecting to Nearest RRH except Coverage Hole.\n\nThe given telecommunication figure illustrates two different scenarios for connecting to a Remote Radio Head (RRH) in a network.

Considering very small Dmin, the angle between RRH-UE line and the railway can be negligible, so only Scheme-1 is for further analysis.\nFigure 6.3.3.2.1.1-1 presents a bi-directional deployment scheme for a telecommunication network, illustrating the arrangement of transmitter-receiver pairs and the associated signal paths. The figure showcases the use of multiple antennas at the base stations to enhance signal reception and transmission, as well as the strategic placement of relay nodes to improve coverage and reduce latency. The layout emphasizes the importance of efficient resource allocation and optimal network design in achieving high-speed, low-latency communication across the network.\nFigure 6.3.3.2.1.1-1 Scheme-1 for Bi-directional deployment\nFor Scheme-1, 1 beam per RRH panel and 6 beam per UE panel is selected. Note that a single RRH panel or UE panel refers to the antenna configuration in Table 6.3.3.2.1-1. The RRH panel boresight is pointed to the railway at the distance of Ds, the beam is pointed to the railway at the distance of Ds. When the UE is at the distance of Ds, the UE panel boresight is point to RRH panel boresight rightly.

Key elements include the transmitter, receiver, and intermediate nodes, each contributing to the overall signal strength. The figure emphasizes the importance of optimizing these components for maximum communication efficiency.\nFigure 6.3.3.2.1.1-2 Link budget for Scheme-1\nFor Scheme-1, the power of side-lobes for different beams change rapidly when UE is near to the RRH and the minimum time duration for the best beam with same beam index can be far less than 160 ms that is the L1-RSRP measurement period for HST FR2 scenario. It is a great challenge for the UE to ensure the performance not to degrade in such location. UE can use different strategy by implementation, such as select the best beam as per RSRP measurement result or directly switch the UE beam point to the main-lobe beam transmission from the next RRH. For the former one, the best beam may be unavailable with high probability once UE beam switching has been performed.\nFor Uni-directional deployment, 1 beam per RRH panel and 2 beam per UE panel is selected. Note that a single RRH panel or UE panel refers to the antenna configuration in Table 6.3.3.2.1-1.

The figure illustrates the various components involved in the link budget calculation, including the transmitter, receiver, antenna gain, and atmospheric loss. The diagram also highlights the importance of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bit error rate (BER) in determining the overall performance of the communication link. The visual representation provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence the link budget in a uni-directional telecommunication system.\nFigure 6.3.3.2.2.2-1 Link budget for Uni-directional deployment\nThe link budget remaining and the minimum beam dwelling time for Uni-directional deployment is shown as Table 6.3.3.2.2.2-1 below.\nTable 6.3.3.2.2.2-1 Link budget remaining and minimum beam dwelling time\n\nFor scenario A and B, uni- and bi-directional scenarios, Ericsson provided evaluation in contributions R4-2104679 and R4-2104680. The analysis has been performed using the antenna array configurations in sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.3.\n\nFor this scenario, it was assumed that the RRHis positioned such that the antenna(s) face directly along the track; i.e. a zero degree steered beam is parallel to the track (in both azimuth and elevation). The UE on the train is positioned such that it’s antenna(s) point directly along the track.\nZero beam steering was assumed, and so the RRHbeam points along the track (but is 10m away from the track) and the UE beam points along the track.\nThese assumptions are not fully optimal, but they are sufficient to demonstrate that a single TX and a single RX beam is sufficient.\nThe antenna radiation patterns in azimuth for the UE and RRHare depicted in figure 6.3.3.3.1-1. The array is symmetrical in both axes, so the elevation patterns are the same as the azimuth patterns.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3.3.3.1-1: RRH and UE antenna radiation patterns in azimuth (Elevation patterns are the same)\nThe most critical link for coverage is the uplink. Thus, the uplink was modelled considering 23dBm transmitter power for the UE. For a train mounted UE, this may be an underestimate for the power.\nThe coverage pattern for the single TX / RX beam is depicted in figure 6.3.3.3.1-3. A uni-directional deployment is considered in which the RRHantenna is pointing in the direction of movement of the train and the UE antenna away from the direction of movement of the train. The x axis represents the distance along the track from the point on the track that is closest to the RRH. (That implies, at zero on the x axis the UE on the side is parallel to the RRH which is 10m away from the side of the track). The y axis represents UL SNR assuming 10dB noise figure at the RRH\n\nFigure 6.3.3.3.1-2 illustrates a telecommunication network's unidirectional deployment scenario, focusing on the signal flow from the transmitter to the receiver. The figure showcases the various components involved, including the transmitter, multiple relay nodes, and the receiver. The signal's path is depicted through the network, highlighting the role of each node in amplifying and directing the signal. The figure emphasizes the importance of efficient signal routing and the potential for signal loss or interference at certain points in the network.\nFigure 6.3.3.3.1-2: Unidirectional deployment scenario\n\nAs can be seen in the figure, good coverage is obtained when the train is further than 60-70m along the track from the RRH. Furthermore, the SNR remains good from 700-800m; i.e. the SNR from the RRHat position zero on the track is still good as the UE passes the next RRH (located at 700m along the track)\n\nFigure 6.3.3.3.1-3 illustrates the uplink signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a single transmitter (TX) and single receiver (RX) beam in a telecommunication system. The figure shows the relationship between the transmit power (PTX) and the received power (PRX) at the receiver, with the SNR calculated as the ratio of the received power to the noise power. The figure highlights the importance of optimizing beamforming and power allocation for improving the communication quality and reliability in wireless networks. The depicted scenario demonstrates the impact of various factors, such as channel conditions and interference, on the performance of the communication system.\nFigure 6.3.3.3.1-3: UL SNR for single TX and single RX beam\n\nUsing DPS, the UE can switch RRH after travelling around 60-70m along the track from RRH2 in the figure. Assuming that this is the case, then the SNR observed when travelling along the track is as depicted in figure 4. For downlink, the SNR will be greater.\n\nFigure 6.3.3.3.1-4 illustrates the uplink signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in a cellular network, assuming a single transmitter/receiver beam and dynamic power control (DPS) switching between remote radio heads (RRHs). The figure depicts the base station (BS), user equipment (UE), and multiple RRHs, with the DPS mechanism enabling efficient power allocation and interference mitigation. The SNR values are crucial for determining the quality of communication and coverage in the network.\nFigure 6.3.3.3.1-4: UL SNR assuming single TX/RX beam and DPS switching between RRH\n\nBased on this analysis, we observe that in scenario 1, in a uni-directional deployment it is sufficient to operate with a single TX beam and a single RX beam.\n\nUni-directional deployment in Scenario A provides very good coverage. Bi-directional deployment would require connection to the second nearest basestation when the UE would be within around 50m from a basestation due to the large azimuth angle to the nearest RRH at that point. Thus, bi-directional deployment would require double the antenna infrastructure at basestations with no coverage or capacity gain.\nIf RRH are equipped with two antenna, improved throughput can be obtained by operating each direction as an independent uni-directional UE. In a future release, multi-antenna single UE operation may also be introduced.\n\nTo consider the number of beams and coverage, a deployment has been analyzed considering scenario B. The RRH antennas are rotated by 13 degrees towards the track, whilst the UE antenna points parallel to the track. Up to 3 RRH beams and up to 2 UE beams are considered. Uplink SNR is considered for depicting the coverage of the beams, since UL SNR is the most critical scenario. DL SNR will be larger than UL SNR.\nThe x axis represents the distance along the track from the point on the track that is closest to the RRH. (That implies, at zero on the x axis the UE on the side is parallel to the RRH, which is 150m away from the side of the track). The y axis represents UL SNR assuming 10dB noise figure at the RRH and 23dBm UE TRP.\n\nFigure 6.3.3.3.3-1 illustrates the coverage of RRH beam 1 and UE beam 1, showcasing the signal strength distribution across different areas. The figure displays a 3D representation of the radio access network, with the RRH (Remote Radio Head) and UE (User Equipment) locations marked. The color gradient represents the signal strength, with darker shades indicating weaker signals and lighter shades indicating stronger signals. The figure highlights the importance of optimizing RRH and UE beamforming to ensure optimal coverage and minimize interference, which is crucial for providing reliable connectivity to mobile devices in various locations.\nFigure 6.3.3.3.3-1: Coverage of RRH beam 1 + UE beam 1\n\nFigure 6.3.3.3.3-2 illustrates the coverage of RRH beam 2 and UE beam 1, showcasing the effective range and signal strength at different locations within a cellular network. The figure demonstrates how the radio resource control (RRC) protocol manages radio frequency (RF) chains and radio bearer setup, ensuring optimal resource allocation. The coverage map highlights the importance of beamforming and power control in enhancing signal quality and reducing interference. The figure also emphasizes the role of base station (BS) and user equipment (UE) in coordinating network operations and maintaining seamless connectivity.\nFigure 6.3.3.3.3-2: Coverage of RRH beam 2 + UE beam 1\n\nFigure 6.3.3.3.3-3 illustrates the coverage of RRH beam 3 and UE beam 2, showcasing the overlapping areas where the radio resource (RRH) and user equipment (UE) beams intersect. This overlapping region is crucial for efficient communication between the base station (BS) and the user equipment (UE), as it allows for the transmission of signals without interference. The figure highlights the importance of precise beamforming and alignment in 5G networks to maximize coverage and ensure seamless connectivity.\nFigure 6.3.3.3.3-3: Coverage of RRH beam 3 + UE beam 2\n\nFigure 6.3.3.3.3-1 indicates that the first RRH beam can provide coverage from around 300-400m along the track to around 1km along the track. This means that the RRH can provide coverage to a point well beyond the following RRH. Figures 6.3.3.3.3-2 and 6.3.3.3.3-3 indicate that the remaining beams can provide coverage closer to the RRH.\nThere is little point in providing more beams. Beam 3 provides coverage from around 100-150m from the RRH. Closer to the RRH, beam 1 from the previous RRH is able to provide coverage. Further beams closer to the RRH would be narrow in coverage and do not improve SNR.\nFigure 6.3.3.3.3-4 indicates the SNR if a single TX/RX beam (beam 1) is used and coverage close to the RRH is provided from the previous/next RRH. The figure indicates that good UL SNR of above 15dB (DL SNR will be larger than this) can be provided along the length of the track with one TX and one RX beam.\n\nFigure 6.3.3.3.3-4 illustrates the coverage provided by a network of radio access nodes (RRHs) and user equipment (UEs) with 1 beam per RRH and UE antenna. The figure shows the signal propagation from the next and previous RRH, demonstrating how the network efficiently utilizes multiple beams to enhance coverage and reduce interference. The figure highlights the importance of precise beamforming and antenna placement in modern wireless networks.\nFigure 6.3.3.3.3-4: Coverage provided from next and previous RRH with 1 beam per RRH and UE antenna.\n\nFigure 6.3.3.3.3-5 depicts the coverage obtained with 3 beams per RRH antenna and 2 beams per UE antenna, considering both the current and previous RRH. The figure shows that the lowest SNR level can be improved a few dB compared to the single beam case.\n\nFigure 6.3.3.3.3-5 illustrates the coverage provided by a radio access network (RAN) consisting of two radio resource control (RRH) units, each equipped with multiple antennas. The figure depicts three beams per RRH antenna and two beams per user equipment (UE) antenna, indicating the network's ability to simultaneously serve multiple users in the same geographical area. The coverage area is visually represented, showcasing the network's reach and capacity to support a large number of connected devices. The figure highlights the importance of efficient antenna configurations in enhancing network performance and capacity.\nFigure 6.3.3.3.3-5: Coverage provided from next and previous RRH with 3 beams per RRH antenna and 2 beams per UE antenna.\n\nThus, we observe that it is perfectly feasible to assume just on beam per antenna also for scenario B as long as the RRH antenna is oriented slightly towards the track. There is some scope for further optimization if 3 RRH / 2 UE beams are considered. Also, allowing for more beams offers more robustness for covering track curves.\n\nFor bi-directional deployment, half of the distance along the track would be covered by one RRH and the other half by the following RRH\n\nFigure 6.3.3.3.4-1 illustrates a bi-directional deployment scenario in a telecommunication network, showcasing the interaction between the core network, access network, and transport network. The core network, represented by the central hub, handles high-capacity traffic and is connected to the access network through the transport network. The figure highlights the use of multiple access technologies, such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi, to provide seamless connectivity for both upstream and downstream data flows. The deployment scenario emphasizes the importance of efficient network design and management to ensure optimal performance and reliability in today's interconnected world.\nFigure 6.3.3.3.4-1: Bi-directional deployment scenario\n\nThe figure below depicts the achievable coverage using 3 beams at the RRH and 3 beams at the UE, with the RRH and UE antennas pointed parallel to the track. After 350m along the track, coverage would be provided by the next RRH. To avoid a break in coverage close to the RRH, the next nearest RRH should be used to serve the UE when it is close in to a RRH.\n\nFigure 6.3.3.3.4-2 illustrates the uplink signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in a cellular network with three beams per user equipment (UE) and two radio access network (RAN) hub (RRH) units in each direction. The figure showcases dynamic power control (DPS) switching between beams, which optimizes the transmission efficiency. The presence of multiple beams and RRH units highlights the network's capacity to handle high traffic and improve coverage.\nFigure 6.3.3.3.4-2: UL SNR with 3 beams per UE and RRH in each direction with DPS switching between beams and RRH\n\nThe throughput CDFs are obtained from fully dynamic system-level simulations, which were carried out to evaluate RRM requirements and mobility performance under high-speed train scenarios in FR2. Simulations were performed with train speed 350 km/h in both uni-directional Scenario-A and -B. In bi-directional case only throughput results for Scenario-B are covered. 50MHz channel bandwidth is assumed.\nThe results include “non-SFN and non-DPS” (i.e., without DPS) transmission scheme analysis corresponding to L3-mobility based on the traditional HO procedure. In these simulations, it is assumed that each BBU has only one RRH corresponding to a more challenging mobility scenario due to longer delays. Alternatively, simulation results for Dynamic Point Selection (DPS) deployments assume that all RRHs are connected to the same BBU, i.e., the mobility is based on L1 measurements and is provided by beam management procedures instead of HO.\nOn the RRH side, the number of Tx beams is chosen according to the deployment, i.e., only 1 Tx beam in Scenario-A, and 1 or 2 Tx beams in Scenario-B.\nThe simulation assumptions and parameters for the evaluation of mobility performance are shown in Table 6.3.8.1-1 6.3.4.1.1-1 and 6.3.4.1.2-1 without DRX.\nThroughput statistics are shown in figures 6.3.3.4-1, 6.3.3.4-2, 6.3.3.4-3, 6.3.3.4-4, 6.3.3.4-5, 6.3.3.4-6, 6.3.3.4-7 and 6.3.3.4-8. The used metric is windowed user (CPE) throughput where each sample represents average throughput over 100 ms window of the CPE. The maximum achievable CPE throughput in this scenario setting with 50 MHz and maximum modulation 64QAM is about 300 Mbps when there is only one CPE served by a cell at a time. Both the performance with enhanced RRM requirements (Req: Enhanced) and legacy RRM requirements (Req: Legacy) are shown in the figures.\nThe results demostrate that in the investigated uni-directional scenarios maximum throughput is achieved over 90% of the time. The reason for such a high performance is that there is only one CPE in the simulated area at a time creating very favorable interference conditions. Propagation condition is fully LOS, which causes the coverage area of a RRH to be long along the track. Also, mobility performance (see 6.3.4.1) in non-DRX case is sufficient to keep CPE most of the time in the cell and beam with good signal conditions. In the uni-directional scenario where train is traveling to opposite direction than RRH beams are pointing to the throughput performance tends to be lower than in the cases where train is traveling to the same direction as RRH beams are pointing to. The reason for this is in the mobility performance that is clearly better in the same direction case. However, enhanced requirements clearly also improve the throughput performance of the opposite direction case. The throughputs in DPS deployment are higher than without DPS in all uni-directional cases.\nIn the bi-directional scenarios maximum throughputs are achieved more seldom i.e., 40-60% of the window samples. One reason, why throughput in bi-directional Scenario-B is not optimal might be because UE is not connected to the closest RRH but to the next closest one, e.g., like it is shown in Figure 5.2.2-3. Bi-directional scenarios are also affected by more frequent handovers and beam switches compared to uni-directional scenarios, which can cause small breaks in data transmission affecting throughput for some of the sampled windows. However, also bi-directional scenario throughput performance gets better when enhanced RRM requirements are applied, despite the lower number of Rx beam options in use compared to legacy RRM requirements. The delay in switching to a better cell or beam gets lower with enhanced requirements. The throughputs in DPS deployment are higher than without DPS in all bi-directional cases.\nFigure 6.3.3.4-1 illustrates the windowed user throughput in a uni-directional scenario without dynamic power control (DPS) in a telecommunication network. The graph depicts the relationship between the window size and the average user throughput, showing how varying the window size affects the overall network performance. The x-axis represents the window size, while the y-axis represents the average user throughput in bits per second. The curve illustrates that as the window size increases, the average user throughput also increases, reaching a point of diminishing returns. This indicates that there is an optimal window size that maximizes network efficiency while minimizing latency. The figure highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate window size for effective communication in telecommunication networks.\nFigure 6.3.3.4-1: Windowed user throughput in uni-directional Scenario-A without DPS\n\nFigure 6.3.3.4-2 illustrates the windowed user throughput in a uni-directional scenario with dynamic power control (DPS) in a wireless network.

The curve demonstrates that as the number of users increases, the total throughput also increases, but at a decreasing rate, indicating a limit to the number of users that can be accommodated without sacrificing throughput.

The graph shows the relationship between the number of users and the total throughput, with different window sizes and user distributions. The x-axis represents the number of users, ranging from 1 to 10, while the y-axis represents the total throughput in bits per second. The graph demonstrates that as the number of users increases, the total throughput also increases, but at a decreasing rate. This indicates that there is a limit to the number of users that can be supported without sacrificing throughput. The different lines on the graph correspond to different window sizes, with larger windows generally resulting in higher throughput. The shaded area around each line represents the variability in throughput due to the random distribution of users. Overall, this figure provides valuable insights into the performance of a bi-directional communication system without DPS under varying user conditions.\nFigure 6.3.3.4-7: Windowed user throughput in bi-directional Scenario-B without DPS\n\nFigure 6.3.3.4-8 illustrates the windowed user throughput in a bi-directional Scenario-B with Dynamic Power Control (DPS) in a telecommunication network.

Simulations were performed with train speed 350 km/h in both uni- and bi-directional Scenario-A and -B.\nThe results include “non-SFN and non-DPS” (i.e., without DPS) transmission scheme analysis corresponding to L3-mobility based on the traditional HO procedure. In these simulations, it is assumed that each BBU has only one RRH creating a more challenging mobility scenario due to longer delays. Alternatively, simulation results for Dynamic Point Selection (DPS) deployments assume that all RRHs are connected to the same BBU, i.e., the mobility is based on L1 measurements and is provided by beam management procedures instead of HO.\nAdditionally, different settings are considered for DRX configurations in CONNECTED mode, including DRX disabled and DRX cycles of 40, 80, and 160 ms.\nOn the RRH side, the number of Tx beams is chosen according to the deployment, i.e., only 1 Tx beam in Scenario-A, and 1 or 2 Tx beams in Scenario-B.\nNon-ideal PDCCH model is used with Aggregation Level (AL) 16.\nThe simulation assumptions and parameters for the evaluation of mobility performance are shown in Table 6.3.8.1-1. The differences from these parameters are explicitly described in the sections below.\nIn the sub-sections below the mobility performance results in HST FR2 deployments based on legacy, i.e., not enhanced, FR2 requirements are presented.\nIn Table 6.3.4.1.1-1, we show parameters that are different from the ones presented in Table 6.3.8.1-1.\nTable 6.3.4.1.1-1: Legacy simulation assumptions for mobility performance evaluation.\n\nThis section shows system level simulation mobility performance results for uni-directional Scenario-A without DPS for both the case when train is traveling into same direction (Dir:Same in legends) as RRH beam are pointing to and into opposite direction (Dir:Opposite in legends). Figure 6.3.4.1.1.1-1 shows successful handover rate per CPE per second and ping-pong rate as percentage of ping-pong handovers per all handovers. Ping-pong handover is observed when two handovers happen back and forth between two same cells in one second. It is observed that handover and ping-pong rates are the highest without DRX and gradually decrease when DRX cycle is increased. Significant drop in successful handovers is observed when train travels to opposite direction than RRH beams are pointed to and DRX is used. Ping-pongs are not observed in the cases with DRX configured.\nFigure 6.3.4.1. 1.1-1 illustrates the handover process and ping-pong handover rates in a mobile communication network. The figure depicts the seamless transition of a mobile device from one cell tower to another, ensuring continuous connectivity. The horizontal axis represents time, while the vertical axis represents the number of handovers. The figure shows that the handover rate is relatively low, indicating a stable and efficient network. The figure also highlights the importance of efficient handover mechanisms in maintaining a high quality of service for mobile users.Figure 6.3.4.1.1-1 presents the handover process and ping-pong handover rates in a mobile communication network, illustrating the seamless transition of a mobile device from one cell tower to another.

It is observed that without DRX the time-of-stay in RRH is slightly lower than the time train with 350 km/h speed takes to travel the distance of one Ds of 700 meters (about 7.2 seconds). This result is due to ping-pongs observed in Figure 6.3.4.1.1.1-1. With DRX cycles 80-160 ms the time-of-stay increases to over 7 seconds.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1-2 illustrates the time-of-stay in a cellular network, depicting the duration a user's device remains within a specific cell. The figure shows the various stages of a user's movement, from entering the cell to exiting, with corresponding time intervals. Key components include the base station, mobile station, and handover points, which are crucial for seamless connectivity and efficient resource allocation. The figure highlights the importance of understanding user movement patterns for optimizing network performance and improving user experience.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.1-2 Time-of-stay in cell\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.1-3 shows time-of-outage percentage per call (existence of CPE in the simulation) and average time-of-outage duration due to low SINR (below -8 dB) conditions. Time-of-outage percentage per call includes all the sources of outage combined. This consists of handover execution time, the time it takes to perform radio link failure related procedures from observing radio link problem until re-establishment of connection and the time below -8 dB SINR conditions are observed in the simulation even prior to radio link problem can be detected based on filtering. It is observed from the results that significant outage is detected only in case train travels to opposite direction than RRHs are pointing to and DRX is used.\n\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1-3 illustrates the time-of-outage per call and time-of-outage duration due to low Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) for a telecommunication system. The figure shows the relationship between the outage duration and the SINR threshold, with different outage durations represented by various symbols. The graph demonstrates the impact of SINR on call quality and service reliability, highlighting the importance of maintaining adequate signal strength for uninterrupted communication.Figure 6.3.4.1.1-3 presents the time-of-outage per call and time-of-outage duration due to low Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) for a telecommunication system.

The results show that failure rate is very high in case train is traveling to opposite direction than RRH beams are pointing to and DRX is used in case of legacy RRM requirements. DRX 40 ms causes about 70% failure rate and DRX 80-160 ms causes even higher number of problems with over 80% failure rate in this scenario. No failures are observed when train is traveling into same direct as RRH beams are pointing to.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1-4 illustrates the mobility failure rate in a network, showing the percentage of handovers that result in a failure within a specific time frame. The graph plots the failure rate against the time interval, with different colors representing different network conditions. Key visual elements include the x-axis, which measures time in hours, and the y-axis, which represents the failure rate in percentage. The data points are connected by lines, indicating the trend of the failure rate over time. The figure highlights the importance of efficient handover processes in maintaining seamless connectivity for mobile users.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.1-4 Mobility failure rate\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.1-5 shows distribution of raw SINR values taken from the CQI measurements and it is observed that SINR level is high and clearly sufficient to support high mobility performance except in the cases with DRX 40-160 ms and train traveling to opposite direction.\nFigure 6.3.4.1. 1.1-5 presents the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distributions for a telecommunication system, illustrating the quality of service across different scenarios. The figure shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of SINR values, with different scenarios represented by distinct curves. The CDF curves indicate the probability of achieving a certain SINR threshold, providing insights into the reliability and performance of the system under various conditions. The figure highlights the impact of various factors, such as the number of users, antenna configurations, and interference management, on the overall system performance.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.1-5 SINR distributions\nThis section shows system level simulation mobility performance results for uni-directional Scenario-A with DPS. Some of the observed statistics are of different type than in the section without DPS. Figure 6.3.4.1.1.2-1 shows successful beam switch rate per CPE per second and ping-pong rate as percentage of ping-pong beam switches per all beam switches. Beam ping-pong is observed when two beam switches happen back and forth between two same beams in one second. Practically in Scenario-A with just one Tx beam per RRH this means ping-pongs between RRHs. In DPS case the same trend is observed in beam switches as with handovers in non-DPS case, without DRX the rates are the highest and gradually rates decrease when longer DRX cycles are used. The differences between the rates in train travel direction are rather low except in the case with DRX cycle 160 ms where beam switch rate drops significantly when train in traveling to opposite direction.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.2-1 illustrates the beam switch and beam ping-pong rates in a telecommunication system, showcasing the process of beamforming and beam switching. The figure depicts the movement of beams between different directions and the corresponding ping-pong rates, which measure the frequency of beam switching. Key components include the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and the beam switch. The diagram highlights the importance of efficient beam management for improving signal quality and coverage in a telecommunication network.Figure 6.3.4.1.1.2-1 illustrates the beam switch and beam ping-pong rates in a telecommunication system, showcasing the process of beamforming and beam switching.

Similar trend is observed here as without DPS that the time-of-outage rates are very low when train is traveling to the same direction as RRH beams are pointing to and none of the outages are caused by low SINR. In the opposite direction time-of-outage starts to increase significantly when DRX cycles are 40 ms or longer. However, time-of-outage is significantly lower than without DPS due to lower delay when switching to different RRH location. Regardless of this the case of DRX cycle 160 ms has very significant time-of-outage in the opposite direction.\n\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.2-2 illustrates the time-of-outage per call and time-of-outage duration due to low Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) for a telecommunication system. The figure shows the relationship between the outage duration and the SINR threshold, with different outage durations corresponding to various SINR levels.

Similar trend is observed without DPS that no failures happen among the studied DRX cycles when train is traveling to same direction as RRH beams are pointing to. In case of opposite direction, the failure indication rates are very high even with short DRX when legacy performance requirements are used with scaling factor 8.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.2-3 illustrates the beam failure indication rate in a telecommunication system, showing the percentage of time that a beam fails to maintain a stable connection. The key components include the base station (BS), mobile station (MS), and the beamforming technique used to maintain signal strength. The graph demonstrates the effectiveness of the beamforming technique in reducing beam failures and improving overall system performance.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.2-3 Beam failure indication rate\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.2-4 shows distribution of raw SINR values taken from the CQI measurements and it is observed that SINR level is high and clearly sufficient to support high mobility performance except in the cases with DRX 40-160 ms and train traveling to opposite direction. However, the amount of low SINR samples below 0 dB are less common in cases of DRX 40-80 ms when DPS is used.\nFigure 6.3.4.1. 1.2-4 presents the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distributions for a telecommunication system, illustrating the quality of service across different scenarios.

Also, comparison between 1 and 2 beams per RRH is included in this section. Figure 6.3.4.1.1.3-1 shows successful handover rate per CPE per second and ping-pong rate as percentage of ping-pong handovers per all handovers. It is observed that without DRX the handover rate is the highest and it drops when DRX cycle 40 ms is used but remains at approximately same level with all simulated DRX cycles. This indicates that there is more time to perform handover in Scenario-B than in Scenario-A particularly when comparing the cases when train is traveling to opposite direction than the RRH beams are pointing to. It is also observed that without DRX there are higher handover and ping-pong rates with 1 beam per RRH than 2 beams per RRH.\nFigure 6.3.4.1 illustrates the handover process and ping-pong handover rates in a mobile communication system. The figure depicts the movement of a mobile device as it transitions between different base stations (BSs), represented by the circles with arrows. The handover process is crucial for maintaining seamless connectivity and ensuring that the device remains connected to the best available network. The ping-pong handover rate, shown on the right side of the figure, indicates the frequency at which the device switches between two base stations, which is an important metric for network performance and user experience. The figure also highlights the role of the mobile device's radio access network (RAN) in coordinating these handovers and maintaining optimal network performance.Figure 6.3.4.1 provides a detailed visual representation of the handover process and ping-pong handover rates in a mobile communication system.

It is observed that without DRX the time-of-stay in RRH is significantly lower than the time train with 350 km/h speed takes to travel the distance of one Ds of 700 meters (about 7.2 seconds) particularly with 1 Tx beam per RRH. This result is due to ping-pongs observed in Figure 6.3.4.1.1.3-1 in similar way as in Scenario A. Time-of-stay is relatively close among all studied DRX cycles in this scenario and close to the expected time-of-stay based on Ds.\nFigure 6.3.4.1. 1.3-2 illustrates the time-of-stay in a cellular network, depicting the duration a user's device remains within a specific cell. The figure shows the various stages of a user's movement, including the initial connection, active usage, and disconnection. Key components include the base station, mobile station, and handover points, which are crucial for seamless connectivity and efficient resource allocation. The figure highlights the importance of understanding user behavior for optimizing network performance and capacity planning.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.3-2 Time-of-stay in cell\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.3-3 shows time-of-outage percentage per call (existence of CPE in the simulation) and average time-of-outage duration due to low SINR (below -8 dB) conditions. It is observed that in Scenario-B the outage rates are very low compared to Scenario-A in case where train is traveling to opposite direction. Only in case of DRX cycle 160 ms there is significant increase in time-of-outage particularly with 2 RRH beams. Beam management becomes more challenging with long DRX and scaling factor 8.\nFigure 6.3.4.1. 1.3-3 illustrates the time-of-outage per call and time-of-outage duration due to low Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) for a telecommunication system. The figure shows the relationship between the outage duration and the SINR threshold, with different outage durations corresponding to various SINR levels. The visual representation helps in understanding the impact of low SINR on call quality and the system's ability to maintain connectivity. Key factors influencing the outage duration include the distance between the user equipment (UE) and the base station (BS), as well as the presence of interference from other signals. The figure highlights the importance of optimizing network parameters to minimize outage times and improve overall call quality.Figure 6.3.4.1. 1.3-3 illustrates the time-of-outage per call and time-of-outage duration due to low Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) for a telecommunication system.

There are no failures in Scenario-B except with DRX 160 ms and train traveling to opposite direction where about 2-8 % failure rate is observed. This is very significantly lower rate of failures than in the corresponding Scenario-A case.\nFigure 6.3.4.1. 1.3-4 illustrates the mobility failure rate in a network, focusing on the impact of signal strength and interference on the connection quality. The graph shows that as the signal strength decreases, the failure rate increases, indicating the need for robust signal transmission technologies. The inclusion of interference highlights the importance of efficient spectrum management in maintaining reliable connections. Key visual elements include the plotted data points, the axes labeled 'Signal Strength (dBm)' and 'Mobility Failure Rate', and the trend line indicating the relationship between the two variables.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.3-4 Mobility failure rate\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.3-5 shows distribution of raw SINR values taken from the CQI measurements and it is observed that SINR level is high and clearly sufficient to support always high mobility performance in all cases except DRX 160 ms and train traveling to opposite direction. It is also observed than without DRX and DRX 40 ms there is clear gain in SINR from having 2 beams per RRH compared to 1 beam per RRH, but when longer DRX is applied the gain is no longer observed. This is caused by the delays in selecting optimal beams with longer DRX.\nFigure 6.3.4.1. 1.3-5 presents the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) distributions for a telecommunication system, illustrating the quality of service across different scenarios.

Figure 6.3.4.1.1.4-1 shows successful beam switch rate per CPE per second and ping-pong rate as percentage of ping-pong beam switches per all beam switches. It is observed that there are clearly more beam switches with 2 beams per RRH than 1 beam per RRH. However, beam ping-pongs are less common in case of 2 beams per RRH. As observed in previous scenarios beam switch and ping-pong rates gradually decrease when DRX in used.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.4-1 illustrates the beam switch and beam ping-pong rates in a telecommunication system, showcasing the process of beamforming and beam switching.

Figure 6.3.4.1.1.5-1 shows successful handover rate per CPE per second and ping-pong rate as percentage of ping-pong handovers per all handovers. It is observed that general levels of handover and ping-pong rates are clearly higher in bi-directional scenario than in uni-directional scenario. Uni-directional Scenario-B has maximum of about 0.2 HO/CPE/s and bi-directional has over 0.8 HO/CPE/s. Ping-pongs are much more common even with DRX in bi-directional scenario.\nFigure 6.3.4.1 illustrates the handover process and ping-pong handover rates in a mobile communication network.

It is observed that time-of-stay is significantly affected by DRX cycle and the number of beams per RRH. Generally, time-of-stay times in bi-directional scenario are about half of the times or lower in comparison to uni-directional scenario.\nFigure 6.3.4.1. 1.5-2 illustrates the time-of-stay in a cellular network, depicting the duration a user's device remains within a specific cell.

It is observed that time-of-outage percentage per call is higher in bi-directional scenario than in uni-directional scenario mainly due to increased handovers. However, also in bi-directional Scenario-B clearly increased outage is only seen when DRX cycle is set to 160 ms.\nFigure 6.3.4.1 illustrates the time-of-outage per call and time-of-outage duration due to low Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) for a telecommunication system.

The graph shows a downward trend, indicating an improvement in handover success rates over time. Key factors influencing this improvement include advancements in network infrastructure, optimization algorithms, and the increasing use of 4G and 5G technologies. The figure highlights the importance of efficient handover processes in ensuring seamless connectivity for mobile users.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.5-4 Mobility failure rate\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.5-5 shows distribution of raw SINR values taken from the CQI measurements and it is observed that SINR level is high and clearly sufficient to support always high mobility performance in all cases except DRX 160 ms. It is also observed than without DRX and DRX 40 ms there is clear gain in SINR from having 2 beams per RRH compared to 1 beam per RRH, but when longer DRX is applied the gain is no longer observed. This is caused by the delays in selecting optimal beams with longer DRX. It is noted that SINR level in low SINR percentiles is lower in bi-directional scenario than uni-directional Scenario-B. Possible reasons for this include using multi-panel UE assumption 1 in bi-directional scenario where two panels per CPE are used. With this assumption only one panel can be activated at the time and used for measurements causing some additional delays in mobility and beam management.\nFigure 6.3.4.1. 1.5-5 SINR distributions illustrates the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distributions for different user equipment (UE) locations within a 5G network.

Figure 6.3.4.1.1.6-1 shows successful beam switch rate per CPE per second and ping-pong rate as percentage of ping-pong beam switches per all beam switches. It is observed that DRX cycle and the number of beams per RRH have significant impact on beam switch rate by decreasing rate when DRX cycle increases. There are more beam switches with 2 beams per RRH than 1 beam per RRH as would be expected in DPS scenario.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.6-1 illustrates the beam switch and beam ping-pong rates in a telecommunication system, showcasing the process of beamforming and beam switching.

It is observed that the outage percentage per call is lower in DPS scenario than without DPS. This is caused by lower outage time in beam switch than handover. Only with DRX 160 ms the outage rate significantly increases from the level without DRX. This can be caused by less optimal beam selection.\nFigure 6.3.4.1. 1.6-2 illustrates the time-of-outage per call and time-of-outage duration due to low Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) for a telecommunication system.

It is also observed that 2 beams per RRH only bring gain in cases where DRX cycle is lower than 80 ms. There is loss when the highest DRX cycle is used due to the least optimal beam management when longest delays are observed.\nFigure 6.3.4.1. 1.6-4 presents the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distributions for a telecommunication system, illustrating the quality of service across different scenarios.

In addition to other parameters varied in the rest of the scenarios, the results with both multi-panel assumption 1 (MPUEAssumption:as1) and 3 (MPUEAssumption:as3) are shown here. With assumption 1, only one panel at a time can perform measurements and with assumption 3 both panels can measure at the same time.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.7-1 shows handover rate per CPE per second and ping-pong handover rate relative to all handovers. It is observed that assumption 3 increases the number of handovers, but not always the number of ping-pongs in this scenario. When measuring with both panels at the same time the measurements are more up to date, which may reduce back-and-forth ping-pong handovers. As seen in other scenarios, longer DRX cycles significantly reduce the number of handovers.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.7-1 illustrates the handover process and ping-pong handover rates in a telecommunication network.

In bi-directional scenario, time-of-stay is very short without DRX due to frequent handovers. The time-of-stay is generally longer with assumption 1 due to more delays in following the best radio conditions, causing less handover to occur. Also, longer DRX cycles increase the average time-of-stay in a cell.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.7-2 illustrates the time-of-stay in a cellular network, showing the duration a user's device remains within a specific cell.

With legacy requirements, the time-of-outage is very significant even without DRX and when multi-panel UE assumption 1 is configured. This is caused by the long delays due to legacy scaling factor 8 particularly when train is traveling towards the serving beam and quickly passing through the RRH location.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.7-3 illustrates the time-of-outage per call and time-of-outage duration due to low Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) for a telecommunication system.

It is observed that with legacy requirements only cases without DRX can provide fast enough mobility procedures to maintain good SINR level. However, with assumption 1, also the case without DRX has significantly degraded SINR for over 5% of the samples.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.7-5 SINR distributions illustrates the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distributions for different user equipment (UE) locations within a cellular network.

The results show that the beam switch rate is significantly higher with multi-panel assumption 3, which is inline with the results seen in 6.3.4.1.1.7 for handovers in non-DPS case. Also, longer DRX cycles decrease the number of beam switches. Ping-pong rates are much more variant depending on DRX cycle where multi-panel assumptions are rather equal except in DRX 80 ms case, where there is higher ping-pong rate with assumption 3.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.8-1 illustrates the performance of a beam switch in a telecommunication network, specifically focusing on the beam ping-pong rates.

The results show that the rates generally increase with longer DRX but are lower than in non-DPS case in 6.3.4.1.1.7. Non-DRX case does not cause significant outages with either assumption 1 or 3. Due to high delays caused by legacy requirements and DRX, the time-of-outage can be high with both multi-panel assumptions when the longest DRX cycle is used.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.8-2 illustrates the time-of-outage per call and time-of-outage duration due to low Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) for a telecommunication system.

It is observed that SINR significantly degrades when mobility delays are increased with DRX cycles. The SINR difference between multi-panel assumptions is not so clear as in non-DPS case in 6.3.4.1.1.7. Assumption 3 gives gain in median and peak percentiles of the CDF particularly without DRX, but assumption 1 can be better in low percentiles of the CDF.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.1.8-4 SINR distributions illustrates the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distributions for various telecommunication scenarios, showcasing the impact of different factors such as path loss, shadowing, and interference on the overall signal quality.

Figure 6.3.4.1.2.1-1 shows successful handover rate per CPE per second and ping-pong rate as percentage of ping-pong handovers per all handovers. Ping-pong handover is observed when two handovers happen back and forth between two same cells in one second. It is observed that handover and ping-pong rates are the highest without DRX and gradually decrease when DRX cycle is increased. Significant drop in successful handovers is observed when train travels to opposite direction than RRH beams are pointed to and DRX cycle is increased to 160 ms.\nFigure 6.3.4.1. 2.1-1 Handover and ping-pong handover rates illustrates the process of handover in a mobile communication system, specifically focusing on the rates at which handovers occur and the frequency of ping-pong handovers.

It is observed that without DRX the time-of-stay in RRH is significantly lower than the time train with 350 km/h speed takes to travel the distance of one Ds of 700 meters (about 7.2 seconds). This result is due to ping-pongs observed in Figure 6.3.4.1.2.1-1. With DRX cycles 80-160 ms the time-of-stay increases to about 7 seconds.\nFigure 6.3.4.1. 2.1-2 illustrates the time-of-stay in a cellular network, depicting the duration a user's device remains within a specific cell.

Some of the observed statistics are of different type than in the section without DPS. Figure 6.3.4.1.2.2-1 shows successful beam switch rate per CPE per second and ping-pong rate as percentage of ping-pong beam switches per all beam switches. Beam ping-pong is observed when two beam switches happen back and forth between two same beams in one second. Practically in Scenario-A with just one Tx beam per RRH this means ping-pongs between RRHs. In DPS case the same trend is observed in beam switches as with handovers in non-DPS case, without DRX the rates are the highest and gradually rates decrease when longer DRX cycles are used. The differences between the rates in train travel direction are rather low.\nFigure 6.3.4.1. 2.2-1 illustrates the beam switch and beam ping-pong rates in a wireless communication system, showcasing the process of beamforming and beam switching.

Similar trend is observed here as without DPS that the time-of-outage rates are very low when train is traveling to the same direction as RRH beams are pointing to and none of the outages are caused by low SINR. In the opposite direction time-of-outage starts to increase significantly when DRX cycles are 80 ms or longer. However, time-of-outage is significantly lower than without DPS due to lower delay when switching to different RRH location.\nFigure 6.3.4.1. 2.2-2 illustrates the time-of-outage per call and time-of-outage duration due to low Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) for a specific telecommunication system.

Figure 6.3.4.1.2.3-1 shows successful handover rate per CPE per second and ping-pong rate as percentage of ping-pong handovers per all handovers. It is observed that without DRX the handover rate is the highest and it drops when DRX cycle 40 ms is used but remains at approximately same level with all simulated DRX cycles. This indicates that there is more time to perform handover in Scenario-B than in Scenario-A particularly when comparing the cases when train is traveling to opposite direction than the RRH beams are pointing to. It is also observed that without DRX there are higher handover and ping-pong rates with 1 beam per RRH than 2 beams per RRH.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.3-1 illustrates the handover process and ping-pong handover rates in a telecommunication network.

This result is due to ping-pongs observed in Figure 6.3.4.1.2.3-1 in similar way as in Scenario A. Time-of-stay is relatively close with all studied DRX cycles in this scenario.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.3-2 illustrates the time-of-stay in a cellular network, showing the duration a user's device remains within a specific cell.

It is also observed than without DRX and DRX 40 ms there is clear gain in SINR from having 2 beams per RRH compared to 1 beam per RRH, but when longer DRX is applied the gain is no longer observed. This is caused by the delays in selecting optimal beams for longer DRX.\n\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.3-5 SINR distributions illustrates the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distributions for different user equipment (UE) locations within a cellular network.

It is also observed than without DRX and DRX 40 ms there is clear gain in SINR from having 2 beams per RRH compared to 1 beam per RRH, but when longer DRX is applied the gain is no longer observed. This is caused by the delays in selecting optimal beams with longer DRX. It is noted that SINR level in low SINR percentiles is lower in bi-directional scenario than uni-directional Scenario-B.

Only in case of DRX 160 ms a significant rate of failures is observed but remaining in low rate. This indicates good performance in beam management with DPS in bi-directional Scenario-B.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.6-3 illustrates the beam failure indication rate in a telecommunication system, which is a crucial metric for assessing the performance of the system.

It is also observed that 2 beams per RRH only bring gain in cases where DRX cycle is lower than 160 ms. There is loss when the highest DRX cycle is used due to the least optimal beam management when longest delays are observed.\n\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.6-4 SINR distributions illustrates the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distributions for various telecommunication scenarios, showcasing the impact of different factors such as path loss, shadowing, and interference on the overall signal quality.

In addition to other parameters varied in the rest of the scenario the results with both multi-panel assumption 1 (MPUEAssumption:as1) and 3 (MPUEAssumption:as3) are shown here. With assumption 1, only one panel at a time can perform measurements and with assumption 3 both panels can measurement at the same time.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.7-1 shows handover rate per CPE per second and ping-pong handover rate. It is observed that assumption 3 increases the number of handovers, but not the number of ping-pongs in this scenario. When measuring with both panels at the same time, the measurements are more up to date, which may reduce back-and-forth ping-pong handovers. As it can be seen in other scenarios, longer DRX cycles significantly reduce the number of handovers. Enhanced requirements increase the number of handovers compared to legacy requirements due to lower mobility delays from measurements.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.7-1 illustrates the handover process and ping-pong handover rates in a telecommunication network.

The ping-pong handover rates indicate the frequency at which the device switches between base stations, which can impact overall network performance. The figure also highlights the role of the mobile device, base stations, and the core network in facilitating these handovers.Figure 6.3.4.1.2.7-1 illustrates the handover process and ping-pong handover rates in a telecommunication network, depicting the movement of a mobile device as it transitions between different base stations.

In bi-directional scenario, time-of-stay is very short without DRX due to frequent handovers. The time-of-stay increases with longer DRX cycles. The time-of-stay is generally shorter with enhanced requirements due to lower mobility delays compared to legacy requirements.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.7-2 illustrates the time-of-stay in a cellular network, showing the duration a user's device remains within a specific cell.

Even with enhanced requirements the time-of-outage is very significant when multi-panel UE assumption 1 is configured and DRX is used. With longest DRX cycle, also outage with assumption 3 is high. However, the outage rates are much lower with these enhanced requirements than the legacy requirements.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.7-3 illustrates the time-of-outage per call and time-of-outage duration due to low Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) for a telecommunication network.

However, the failure rates are much lower with these enhanced requirements than the legacy requirements.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.7-4 illustrates the mobility failure rate in a telecommunication network, focusing on the impact of various factors such as signal strength, network congestion, and device mobility.

It is observed that with enhanced requirements DRX cycles up to 80 ms with multi-panel assumption 3 can provide fast enough mobility procedures to maintain a good SINR level. Also, multi-panel assumption 1 can provide good SINR without DRX in over 95% of the samples. Higher DRX cycles have significantly degraded SINRs with assumption 1.\n\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.7-5 SINR distributions illustrates the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distributions for different user equipment (UE) locations within a cellular network.

The results show that the beam switch rate is significantly higher with multi-panel assumption 3, except in the case without DRX where the numbers are rather equal. Also, longer DRX cycles decrease the number of beam switches. The beam switch rate is generally higher with enhanced requirements compared to legacy requirements. Ping-pong rates are quite equal between the multi-panel assumptions.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.8-1 illustrates the performance of a beam switch in a telecommunication network, specifically focusing on the beam ping-pong rates.

It is observed that SINR levels are generally good up to DRX cycle 80 ms and the SINRs with the longest DRX cycle 160 ms are much less degraded than in the scenario with legacy requirements. The SINR difference between multi-panel assumptions is not so clear as in non-DPS case in 6.3.4.1.2.7. Assumption 3 gives gain in median and peak percentiles of the CDF particularly without DRX, but assumption 1 can be better in low percentiles.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.8-4 SINR distributions illustrates the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distributions for various telecommunication scenarios, showcasing the impact of different factors such as path loss, shadowing, and interference on the overall signal quality.

Figure 6.3.4.1.2.9-1 shows successful handover rate per CPE per second and ping-pong rate as percentage of ping-pong handovers per all handovers. Similar to open space scenarios, it is observed in general that handover and ping-pong rates are the highest without DRX and gradually decrease when DRX cycle is increased. Compared to the Scenario A, the successful handover rate is significantly lower for all DRX cycles when the train travels to opposite direction than the RRH beams are pointing to. This suggests that there may not be enough time to perform the handover in the tunnel scenario when the train is moving towards the serving beam.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2 Handover and ping-pong handover rates illustrates the process of handover in a mobile communication system, specifically focusing on the rates of handover and ping-pong handover. The figure depicts two scenarios: a regular handover and a ping-pong handover. In the regular handover, the mobile device transitions from one cell to another, while in the ping-pong handover, the device rapidly switches between cells, creating a pattern of handovers. The figure provides a visual representation of these processes, highlighting the importance of efficient handover management in maintaining seamless connectivity and reducing dropped calls or slow data transmission.Figure 6.3.4.1.2 Handover and ping-pong handover rates provides a visual representation of the handover process in a mobile communication system, focusing on the rates of handover and ping-pong handover.

It is observed that without DRX the time-of-stay in RRH is significantly lower than the time that the train with 350 km/h speed takes to travel the distance of one Ds of 700 meters (about 7.2 seconds). Compared to Scenario A when the train is traveling to the same direction as the RRH beam are pointing to, time-of-stay with low DRX (up to 40ms) is lower. This result is due to handover and ping-pongs rate observed in Figure 6.3.4.1.2.1-1 which is seen high with low DRX cycles in the tunnel scenario. With DRX cycles 80-160 ms the time-of-stay increases to about 7 seconds.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.9-2 illustrates the time-of-stay in a cellular network, depicting the duration a user's device remains within a specific cell.

It is seen that the failure rates are extremely high when the train travels to opposite direction than RRH beams are pointing to, i.e., the mobility failure rate is over 50% in this scenario even without DRX. No failures are observed when train is traveling to the same directíon as the RRH beams orientation.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.9-4 illustrates the mobility failure rate in a network, showing the percentage of handovers that result in a failure. The x-axis represents the number of handovers, while the y-axis indicates the failure rate.

It is observed that SINR level is high and clearly sufficient to support high mobility performance for the case where the train is traveling into same direction as RRH beams are pointing to. However, when the train travels opposite to the RRH beam pointing direction, there are areas that SINR may drop low and insufficient to support the mobility especially when the DRX increases, whereas at some areas the SINR becomes extremely good.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.9-5 presents the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distributions in a wireless communication system, illustrating the performance of different transmission strategies.

Figure 6.3.4.1.2.10-1 shows successful beam switch rate per CPE per second and ping-pong rate as percentage of ping-pong beam switches per all beam switches. Similar to Scenario-A, since there is just one Tx beam per RRH this means ping-pongs between RRHs. In DPS case the same trend is observed in beam switches as with handovers in non-DPS case, i.e., without DRX the rates are the highest and gradually rates decrease when longer DRX cycles are used. The differences between the rates in train travel direction are rather low.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2 illustrates the beam switch and beam ping-pong rates in a wireless communication system, showcasing the process of beamforming and beam switching.

Similar trend is observed without DPS that no failures happen among the studied DRX cycles when train is traveling to same direction as RRH beams are pointing to. On the other hand, significantly high failures are observed with train traveling to opposite direction.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2 illustrates the beam failure indication rate in a telecommunication system, showing how the rate varies with different parameters such as distance, angle, and atmospheric conditions.

In general, compared to non-DPS case, the probability of low SINR samples below 0 dB are lower when DPS is used compared to non-DPS case. While comparing to open space scenarions, higher SINR values can be achieved in the tunnel case.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2 presents the SINR (Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio) distributions for a telecommunication network, illustrating the varying quality of service across different locations. The figure shows a range of SINR values, from -10 dB to 4 dB, with a logarithmic scale on the y-axis. The x-axis represents different locations within the network, marked as 10, 20, 30, and so on, up to 40. The distribution curve indicates that the quality of service varies across the network, with some locations experiencing better signal quality (higher SINR values) and others facing interference and noise challenges (lower SINR values). This information is crucial for network planning and optimization to ensure consistent performance across the network.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.10-4 SINR distributions.\n\nThe coverage of the open-space RRHs at the tunnel entrance/exit is likely limited since the RRH beams can be blocked by the tunnel’s outer wall. This is expected to have impacts to mobility performance in uni-directional deployment when the train is approaching/leaving the tunnel from/to the open space. This section demonstrates mobility performance such transition scenario. The aim is to provides insights on the impact of potential coverage issue at the tunnel entrance/exit to the mobility performance.\n\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2 - Coverage issue at the tunnel entrance in uni-directional deployment - illustrates a coverage issue at the tunnel entrance in a uni-directional deployment. The figure shows a telecommunication network with a tunnel entrance, where the signal strength drops significantly, resulting in poor coverage. This issue is particularly pronounced in uni-directional deployments, where the signal only travels in one direction. The figure highlights the importance of proper planning and infrastructure design to ensure adequate coverage in such scenarios. Key components include the base station, user equipment, and the tunnel entrance, with the coverage issue being the focal point of the analysis.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.11-1 Coverage issue at the tunnel entrance in uni-directional deployment\n\nThe assumptions and setting for the simulation are as follows. Uni-directional deployment is considered for the RRH deployed outside the tunnel (RRH1 in Figure 6.3.4.1.2.11-2). Assume that the beam’s main lobe from RRH1 is pointing to the entrance/exit of the tunnel. Depending on the tunnel’s dimension, the LoS paths can be seen up to d [m] inside the tunnel, meaning that NLoS-only condition will exist after distance d. To enable the NLoS condition, the probability of LoS [TR38.901] in the channel model is set as\n\nDistance d is given as d=300m for Scenario A and d=22.6m for Scenario B following the below assumption and estimation. Assume that a tunnel with dimensions:\n-\twidth (w) = 6m, and height (DTunnel,height ) = 5.5m\n-\tOpen space RRH:  DRRH,height = 15m; CPE : DUE,height = 5m\nIt can be estimated that the coverage of RRH1’s beam behind the tunnel entrance/exit in vertical and horizonal direction are 300 m and 22.1 m for Scenario A, and 14.3m and 22.6m for Scenario B, respectively (Figure 6.3.4.1.2.11-1 for the calculation).\n\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.11-2 illustrates the calculation of Line-of-Sight (LoS) coverage of a Radio Remote Head (RRH) within a tunnel. The figure depicts the tunnel's interior, with the RRH's beam pattern represented by concentric circles emanating from the RRH's location. The coverage area is calculated based on the beam's width and the distance between the RRH and the points within the tunnel. The figure highlights the importance of accurate beamwidth and positioning for optimal signal coverage in such confined spaces.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.11-2 Calculation of LoS coverage of RRH1’s beam inside the tunnel.\nThen, d=300m for Scenario A and d=22.6m for Scenario B which are probably the best possible case for the LoS channel condition at the tunnel entrance/exit.\nOnly non-DPS scheme (HO-based) is considered as the assumption is that open-space RRHs belong to different cell than those in the tunnel. However, the results for DPS scheme are expected similar. Other RRM parameters for the simulation follow the enhanced settings in Table 6.3.4.1.2-1.\nThe mobility robustness performances, which are measured by the time-of-outage and mobility failure rate, are presented.\n\nThis section shows the mobility performance when the train is moving into the tunnel from Scenario A (i.e., corresponding to when the train is traveling to the same direction as RRH beam is pointing to, see Figure 6.3.4.1.2.11-1-(a)), and leaving the tunnel to the open space (i.e., corresponding to when the train is traveling to the opposite direction than RRH beams are pointing to, see Figure 6.3.4.1.2.11-1(b)).\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.11.1-1 shows time-of-outage percentage per call (existence of CPE in the simulation). Compared to Scenario A, time-of-outage in this transition case is seen to clearly increase for both traveling directions of the train. The increase is observed more significant when the train is traveling to the opposite direction of the RRH beams orientation and with longer DRX cycles due to the limited LoS coverage.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.11.1-1 illustrates the time-outage percentage when a user equipment (UE) transits from Scenario A and tunnel, showing the impact of various factors on network reliability. The figure presents a detailed breakdown of outage percentages across different time intervals, providing valuable insights for network optimization. Key components include the UE, tunnel, and various network elements that contribute to the overall outage percentage. The figure highlights the importance of efficient network design and management to minimize downtime and ensure seamless connectivity for users.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.11.1-1 Time-of-outage percentage when UE transits from Scenario A and tunnel\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.11.1-2 shows inter-cell mobility failure rate (RLF + HOF percentage of all handover and failure events). It is observed that the limited coverage issue does not have any impact when the train is moving same with the beam pointing direction. However, failure rate is significantly increased when the train is moving opposite to beam direction (i.e., leaving the tunnel) and becomes unacceptable when high DRX cycles are considered.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.11.1-2 illustrates the inter-cell mobility failure rate when a user equipment (UE) transits between Scenario A and tunnel. The figure depicts the probability of failure for different mobility scenarios, including handover, tunnel, and inter-cell mobility. The x-axis represents the number of cells, while the y-axis represents the failure rate. The different lines on the graph correspond to different mobility scenarios, with Scenario A being the baseline. The figure highlights the impact of inter-cell mobility on the failure rate and provides insights into the design of mobile networks to minimize failures and improve user experience.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.11.1-2 Inter-cell mobility failure rate when UE transits between Scenario A and tunnel\n\nThis section shows the mobility performance when the train is entering/leaving the tunnel from/to Scenario B. Figure 6.3.4.1.2.11.2-1 shows time-of-outage percentage per call (existence of CPE in the simulation). Compared to Scenario B, time-of-outage is increased for both traveling directions of the train when taking into account the NLoS condition at the transition area. Longer DRX cycles result in higher time-of-outage rate. The increase is seen more significant when the train is traveling to the opposite direction than RRH beams are pointing to due to the limited LoS coverage.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.11.2-1 illustrates the time-of-outage percentage when a user equipment (UE) transits between Scenario B and tunnel. The figure shows the percentage of time that the UE is not connected to the network due to the transition process. The x-axis represents the time in seconds, while the y-axis represents the percentage of time. The data points are plotted as a line graph, with the x-axis ranging from 0 to 100 seconds and the y-axis ranging from 0 to 100%. The line graph shows that the time-of-outage percentage is relatively low, indicating that the transition process is quick and efficient. The shaded area around the line graph represents the confidence interval, which indicates the variability in the data. The shaded area is relatively small, suggesting that the results are consistent and reliable. Overall, the figure provides valuable insights into the performance of the UE transition process between Scenario B and tunnel.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.11.2-1 Time-of-outage percentage when UE transits between Scenario B and tunnel\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.11.2-2 shows inter-cell mobility failure rate (RLF + HOF percentage of all handover and failure events). When the train is moving same with the beam pointing direction, it is observed that the limited coverage issue starts making the impact to the mobility at DRX 80ms. When the train is moving opposite with the beam pointing direction, the failure rate is significantly increased especially with DRX enabled.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.11.2-2 illustrates the inter-cell mobility failure rate when a user equipment (UE) transits between Scenario B and tunnel. The figure depicts the probability of failure for different mobility scenarios, with a focus on the transition between cells. The x-axis represents the number of cells, while the y-axis represents the failure rate. The figure shows that the failure rate is generally low, with a slight increase as the number of cells increases. This suggests that the inter-cell mobility system is reliable, with only a small chance of failure when a UE moves between cells.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.2.11.2-2 Inter-cell mobility failure rate when UE transits between Scenario B and tunnel\n\n\n\nMobility performance in open-space scenarios:\nIn the previous sections (6.3.4.1.1.1, 6.3.4.1.1.2, 6.3.4.1.2.1, 6.3.4.1.2.2), it was demonstrated that HST FR2 Scenario-A deployment (Figure 6.3.4.1.3-1) where the train is travelling in the direction opposite to serving beam orientation may experience mobility challenges when DRX cycle of 40 ms is used with legacy requirements. This happens due to the very fast degradation of serving RRH signal (Figure 6.3.4.1.3-2). However, there is a significant improvement in Scenario-A from enhanced requirements compared to legacy requirements. With enhanced requirements, mobility robustness is sufficient when DRX cycle of 40 ms is used, but problems can be observed when DRX cycle is increased to 80 ms when the train is travelling in the direction opposite to serving beam orientation.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.3 presents a scheme of HST FR2 in an opposite uni-directional Scenario-A, illustrating the transmission and reception of signals in a high-speed train (HST) environment. The figure showcases the frequency division duplex (FDD) operation, where the uplink and downlink frequencies are separated, allowing for simultaneous transmission and reception. The HST is depicted as a mobile station (MS) connected to a terrestrial network, while the base station (BS) is responsible for signal transmission and reception. The figure highlights the importance of efficient signal management in such scenarios, ensuring seamless communication and minimal interference.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.3-1: A scheme of HST FR2 opposite uni-directional Scenario-A.\n\nFigure 6.3.4.1.3 -2 presents a detailed propagation map of a serving Radio Resource Holder (RRH) antenna model without back lobe. The map illustrates the signal strength distribution across various angles and distances, providing valuable insights into the antenna's radiation pattern. The figure showcases how the signal strength varies with the angle of arrival, offering a comprehensive understanding of the antenna's performance in a real-world scenario. The absence of back lobe indicates that the antenna does not radiate energy in the opposite direction, which is crucial for efficient signal transmission and reception.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.3-2: Propagation map of the serving RRH, antenna model without back lobe.\n\nThe RSRP traces of the serving (RRH1) and target (RRH2) RRHs are shown in Figure 6.3.4.1.3-3 with at different zoom levels. One can observe that the signal level from target RRH get high enough already much earlier than handover happens. However, the source RRH signal drops drastically near the RRH location. In this traced case, the handover happens early enough to transmit control messages even with realistic PDCCH model. It is also obvious that even slight delays in handover initiation will cause source RRH to drop to unreachable levels (e.g., RSRP below -120 dBm).\nFigure 6.3.4.1.3 presents RSRP traces of serving and target RRHs at two distinct scales, with vertical lines indicating A3 trigger coordinates, HO completion, and the source RRH location. The figure illustrates the signal strength and handover processes between the serving and target RRHs, providing insights into the network's performance and coverage. Figure 6.3.4.1.3 provides a detailed analysis of RSRP traces from serving and target RRHs across two distinct scales. The figure showcases vertical lines that represent A3 trigger coordinates, HO completion, and the source RRH location, offering insights into the signal strength and handover processes between the serving and target RRHs. This information is crucial for understanding the network's performance and coverage, as well as identifying areas that may require improvement or additional infrastructure.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.3-3: RSRP traces of serving and target RRHs at two different scales. Vertical lines show A3 trigger coordinate, HO complete, and source RRH location.\n\nBased on the simulation results and analysis presented above we can conclude that DRX cycle of 80ms shall be used with precautions in uni-directional Scenario-A.\nIn sections (6.3.4.1.1.3, 6.3.4.1.1.4, 6.3.4.1.1.5, 6.3.4.1.1.6, 6.3.4.1.2.3, 6.3.4.1.2.4, 6.3.4.1.2.5, 6.3.4.1.2.6) it was demonstrated that Scenario-B mobility performance with enhanced RRM requirements in both uni-directional and bi-directional scenarios is sufficient with DRX cycles up to 80 ms. Compared to legacy RRM requirements the mobility robustness measured by mobility failure and time-of-outage rates is significantly improved with enhanced RRM requirements also in Scenario-B.\nIn sections 6.3.4.1.1.7, 6.3.4.1.1.8, 6.3.4.1.2.7, 6.3.4.1.2.8, it was shown that Scenario-A with bi-directional deployment needs similar precautions for DRX cycle of 80 ms as uni-directional scenario. Also, bi-directional scenario mobility robustness is significantly improved by the enhanced RRM requirements compared to legacy RRM requirements. Multi-panel UE measurement assumption was also shown to have significant impact to mobility robustness particularly in non-DPS scenario. Having UE capability to measure both directions at the same time can benefit mobility robustness.\nMobility performance in tunnel scenarios:\nAs demonstrated in previous sections (6.3.4.1.2.9, 6.3.4.1.2.10), the train travelling in the direction opposite to serving beam orientation likely experiences mobility challenges. The issue is more more severe than Scenario A as it may occur even when enhanced requirements are used and without DRX enabled. The root cause of such mobility issues is similar to what has been observed in Scenario A, i.e., the sudden drop of the source RSRP level near the source RRH which is due to the close distance between the RRH locations and the track (Dmin). As tunnel deployment has even shorter Dmin and lower DRRH,height, the source signal level drops more extreme causing high probability of mobility failure even when DRX is not enabled.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.3-4 presents a detailed scheme illustrating the High Speed Tunnel (HST) Frequency Division Duplex (FR2) system in operation, specifically focusing on the opposite uni-directional Tunnel scenario. The figure showcases the various components involved, including the transmitter (TX), receiver (RX), and the tunnel itself, which facilitates bidirectional communication between the two. The bidirectional nature of the tunnel is highlighted by the presence of two separate paths, one for each direction of data transmission. The figure also emphasizes the role of frequency division duplexing, which allows for efficient use of the available spectrum and improved overall system performance. The layout of the figure provides a clear understanding of how the HST FR2 system operates in the context of the uni-directional Tunnel scenario, offering valuable insights into the design and functionality of such telecommunication systems.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.3-4: A scheme of HST FR2 opposite uni-directional Tunnel scenario.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.3-5 shows propagation map around the source RRH location (the physical features of the tunnel like reflections are not considered).  Only the source RRH is considered in the pathgain + antenna gain + beam gain of the map. It is observed that there is very strong signal level along the track until the RRH location, and with the backlobe suppressed signal level drops to unusable level right after the RRH if train is moving towards east and RRH antenna is pointed towards west.\n\nFigure 6.3.4.1.3-5 illustrates the propagation map of the serving RRH, focusing on the antenna model without back lobe. The figure showcases the signal's behavior as it travels through the air, reflecting off surrounding objects, and reaching the receiver. The visual representation highlights the importance of antenna design and positioning in enhancing signal reception and reducing interference. The absence of back lobe indicates that the antenna design effectively mitigates signal reflection, resulting in a more focused and efficient transmission path.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.3-5: Propagation map of the serving RRH, antenna model without back lobe.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.3-6 shows the RSRP traces of the source (RRH1) and target (RRH2) RRHs. It is observed that signal level from the serving beam increases when the train is approaching the source RRH, and suddenly drops drastically when the train is about 5m from the Source RRH location. One can also see that the first A3 event is triggered when the train is right under the source RRH where there is no longer coverage from serving beam. Later, several attempts for triggering A3 events are carried out in order to make HO, but there is no successful HO achieved. This can be understandable as the signal level source RRH has dropped to unreachable level causing the loss of HO command. After staying outage for a significantly long period, the cell selection procedure is initiated to make the UE connecting to the new cell.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.3-6 illustrates the RSRP (Received Signal Strength Indicator) traces of a source and target in a telecommunication scenario. The vertical lines represent the A3 trigger coordinate, new cell selection, and the location of the source RRH (Radio Remote Head). The figure provides valuable insights into signal strength and cell selection processes, aiding in the optimization of communication networks.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.3-6: RSRP traces of source and target. Vertical lines show A3 trigger coordinate, new cell selection, and source RRH location.\nThe system simulation results in Sections (6.3.4.1.2.9 and 6.3.4.1.2.10) pointed out the mobility issue for HST FR2 happened inside the tunnel. RAN4 studies concluded that multi-panel reception, in which the UE can receives the DL signals simultaneously from two opposite directions, is a candidate solution for the considered issue, i.e., if one link is failed, the UE still has connections to the network via the other link.\nIn Section 6.3.4.1.2.11, the mobility robustness was studied for the mobility at the tunnel entrance/exit. In such areas, the coverage of the RRHs outside the tunnel may be limited inside the tunnel due to the blockage of the tunnel outer surfaces. It was demonstrated that time-of-outage and inter-cell mobility failure rate both increase suggesting the potential mobility problem that may occur at the tunnel entrance/exit. Nevertheless, such issue can be resolved by deployment-based solutions, i.e., placing the open-space RRHs which is nearest to the tunnel entrance/exit closer to the railway track, e.g., the RRH2’s location shown in Figure 6.3.4.1.3-7.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.3-7 illustrates a special deployment of an open-space Radio Remote Head (RRH) next to the tunnel entrance. This configuration is designed to optimize signal coverage in areas with challenging terrain, such as tunnels or mountainous regions. The figure shows the RRH, which is a type of base station used in wireless communication networks, positioned strategically to ensure seamless connectivity for users in the vicinity. The open-space RRH is particularly useful in scenarios where traditional RRH might not provide adequate signal strength or coverage due to the presence of obstacles or uneven terrain. The deployment also highlights the importance of network planning and optimization in areas with unique geographical features, as it ensures that users can access the network reliably and efficiently, even in remote or difficult-to-reach locations.\nFigure 6.3.4.1.3-7: Example of a special deployment for the open-space RRH next to the tunnel entrance.\n\n",

The simulation results of beam dwelling time are obtained from system-level simulations which were carried out to evaluate legacy RRM requirements under high-speed train scenarios.\nTable 6.3.8.1-1: Simulation assumptions for beam dwelling time\n\nThe simulation results of beam dwelling time are shown in figures 6.3.8.1-1-3 for unidirectional scenarios with a different number beams transmitted by RRH. The simulation results of beam dwelling time are shown in figures 6.3.8.1-4-6 for bidirectional scenarios with different number of beams transmitted by RRH.\nIt is worth noting that the simulation results are the average beam dwelling time. In the simulation, beam dwelling time is influenced by beam coverage and beam switching rate (including hysteresis). Beam coverage is discussed in detail in clause 6.3.8.2, where ideal beam dwelling time is investigated.\nIn the case of multi-beam operation cases shown in figures 6.3.8.1-2, 6.3.8.1-3, 6.3.8.1-5 and 6.3.8.1-6, it can be observed that the dwelling time of Beam 0 is the shortest because the coverage of Beam 0 is the smallest.\n\nFigure 6.3.8.1-1 illustrates the average beam dwelling time with one beam per RRH in unidirectional scenarios. The figure depicts the time duration a user equipment (UE) spends in a single beam before switching to another, represented by the horizontal axis. The vertical axis shows the corresponding average beam dwelling time in milliseconds. The data points are plotted across different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels, ranging from -10 dB to 10 dB, which are crucial for understanding the performance of the radio access network (RAN) in terms of energy efficiency and capacity. The figure highlights the impact of beam management strategies on the overall network performance, particularly in scenarios where there is a single radio access point (RRH) serving multiple UEs.\nFigure 6.3.8.1-1: Average beam dwelling time with 1 beam per RRH for unidirectional scenarios\n\nFigure 6.3.8.1-2 illustrates the average beam dwelling time with two beams per Radio Remote Head (RRH) in unidirectional scenarios.

Key elements include the base station (gNB), radio access network (RAN), user equipment (UE), and the beam management system.

The figure highlights the importance of efficient beam management in enhancing network performance and coverage, particularly in scenarios with multiple RRHs (Radio Remote Heads) and UEs. The depicted 2-beam configuration is crucial for reducing interference and improving data rates in both directions.\nFigure 6.3.8.1-6: Average beam dwelling time with 2 beams per RRH for bidirectional scenarios\n\nIn HST deployment scenarios, the footprint of an RRH beam can be represented by an ellipse as shown in figure 6.3.8.2-1. It is assumed that UE aboard an HST is moving with constant velocity  and its trajectory is a straight line. An RRH is located at the point  in which its antenna array boresight for the th beam is oriented towards a point  which is along the trajectory of UE.\nFigure 6.3.8.2-1 illustrates the beam footprint of a Remote Radio Head (RRH), which is a key component in a cellular network. The figure shows the coverage area of the RRH, with the outer circle representing the main beam and the inner circle indicating the partial beam. The beamwidth is a crucial parameter for optimizing the network's capacity and coverage. The figure also highlights the downtilt angle, which affects the signal's strength in the horizontal plane. The visual representation of the beam footprint provides valuable insights for network planning and optimization.\nFigure 6.3.8.2-1: RRH beam footprint\nThe ellipse centred at  can be expressed as\n\nwhere\n,\n\n,    ,\nFrom trigonometry,  can be derived from the elevation HPBW , elevation pointing angle , semimajor axis  and the magnitude of  as follows\n\nIn the equation of the semi-minor axis,  is the angle between the vectors  and , which can be expressed in terms of the semi-major axis , elevation HPBW  and elevation pointing angle .\n\nReferring to figure 6.3.8.2-1, the segment length of the UE’s trajectory covered by the footprint of beam  is the line segment joining the points  and , which are the intersection points of the ellipse with the line , . In determining these two points, rewriting the ellipse equation as a quadratic equation for  gives\n\nwhere the coefficients are\n\n\n\n\nThe two solutions to the quadratic equation are\n,\nThe segment length  (in metres) of the UE’s trajectory covered by beam  is given by\n\nThus, the dwelling time  (in seconds) for beam  is defined by\n\nIn order to determine the width of the footprint provided by beam , it is the points of intersection of the ellipse with a straight line passing through  perpendicular to the line , . The width  (in metres) of the footprint defined by beam  is expressed as\n\nwhere\n,\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.3.8.2-1 shows the coverage length, width and dwelling time for 3 beams where the boresight is pointing to different positions along the UE’s trajectory for Scenario A.\nTable 6.3.8.2-1: Beam coverage length, width and dwelling time\n\nAs can be observed in table 6.3.8.2-1, the beam coverage length shrinks as  decreases, resulting in non-uniform beam coverage. A beam with very short beam segment length  is not useful for HST because the UE may not be able detect it before moving to the adjacent beam. As such, the number of useful beams per RRH can be limited, which depends on deployment scenarios. Referring to the equation of the ellipse, the beam footprint size is a function of the semimajor axis  and semiminor axis . It can be observed from the equation that one key parameter that influences the magnitude of  and  is the elevation HPBW  and azimuth HPBW . This means, those beams with a short segment length can be increased by widening the HPBW. However, it is important to note that antenna array directivity is inversely proportional to the HPBW; that is, a wider HPBW leads to lower antenna-array directivity. As the RRH typically employs uniform rectangular antenna arrays, the directivity  can be expressed in terms of the elevation and azimuth HPBW as [2]\n\nFor Beam , if  and  are widened by a factor of  and , respectively, the resultant directivity  is\n\nLet  denote the original directivity of Beam 0 (where the HPBW is not widened) and dividing it by  yields\n\nAs compared with ,  is now dropped by the product of  and , where both terms are real numbers. In order to ensure the link budget (or performance) of Beam  is not worse than Beam  as a consequence of using lower directivity, the product () should be bounded by the condition\n,\nwhere the term  is the ratio of the free space path loss between Beams  and , and for , and . Beam  serves as a baseline beam whose directivity equals the original unenlarged HPBW. When  the drop in directivity for Beam  is equalized by the decrease in free space path loss with reference to Beam .\nWidening the HPBW of beams with a short segment length in coverage areas near to the RRH provides an alternative solution to mitigate the problem identified in clause 6.3.4.1 for unidirectional deployment scenarios, where the UE is moving in the opposite direction to the pointing direction of RRH Tx beams. It can also be used to extend coverage in areas near to RRH in bi-directional deployment scenarios, and to reduce the large propagation delay jump, which causes uplink timing issues.\n\n",

Otherwise, RAN4 will introduce a mechanism for one shot large uplink timing adjustment for FR2 HST scenarios with UE allowed to adjust uplink timing beyond Tq.\nWith network signalling to enable one shot large timing adjustment UE shall apply one shot large timing adjustment on TCI switching occasion if UE measurement on DL timing difference is larger than a timing difference threshold:\n-\tOption 1: 9*64*Tc = CP/2\n-\tOption 2: Tq = 4.5*64*TC = CP/4\n-\tOption 3: Select a threshold from above options or new options, and the performance degradation due to timing error on both DL and UL to UE and network after TCI state switch is expected if network assistant signalling to inform UE on cross RRH TCI state switch is not introduced.\n-\tOther options are not precluded\nRAN4 will further study RRM requirement, and acceptable value of residual error in UE large one-shot UL timing adjustment. RAN4 will further discuss the accuracy performance and testing issues based on conclusion of related procedures.\nRandom Access Procedure:\nNo specification change shall be introduced for the current RA procedure due to Rel-17 FR2 HST.\nWhen large one-shot UL timing adjustment procedure is disabled, i.e., when the highSpeedLargeOneStepUL-TimingFR2-r17 flag defined in TS 38.331 is false, there is still a need to adjust UL timing of the UE to address a large difference in radio propagation delays in between the source and the target beams.\nA large jump in propagation delays is typical for inter-RRH TCI state switch in uni-directional scenarios, e.g., shown in Figure 5.2.1-2. However, RAN4 has also agreed that highSpeedLargeOneStepUL-TimingFR2-r17 signaling is not limited to a particular FR2 HST deployment and/or scenarios, i.e., bi-directional scenario or uni-directional scenario. Therefore, network-based solution shall also be applicable for the bi-directional scenarios (e.g., shown in Figures 5.2.2-5,6,7) where the jump in propagation delays cannot be avoided either.\nSince beam management procedures were originally designed in NR Rel-15, it is generally assumed that the Tx beams are collocated, i.e., a large propagation delay difference in between the source and the target beams is not expected. Hence, TCI state change does not imply any explicit UL synchronization procedure, such as RA as a part of HO.\nThe straightforward approach in the term of HST FR2 Rel-17 WI is to use already existing and standardized procedures for UL timing adjustment. Random Access (RA) towards the target TCI state provides a possibility for the network to measure the propagation delay from the RA preamble and to signal the accurate UL timing advance value with random access reply (RAR). Transmission of RA preamble itself can be triggered with the PDCCH order.\nAn example of sequence diagram of the procedure is shown in Figure 7.2.2.1-1. The upper box includes the beam management related operations that are repeated periodically, such as transmission of reference signals in the UL, network-initiated and small-scale autonomous UL timing adjustments, beam/SSB measurements, detection, and reporting, etc. The core of the network-controlled UL timing adjustment mechanism is contained in the lower box that is executed when the NW triggers TCI state switch.\nFigure 7.2.2.1 - 1 presents a sequence diagram illustrating the process of UL timing adjustment through RA-based methods during a state switch from TCI to TIA in a telecommunication system. The diagram showcases the interaction between the eNodeB, UE, and the RRC protocol stack, highlighting the role of the RRC procedure PDCP_TIMING_ADJUST. The visual representation emphasizes the synchronization and timing adjustments necessary for maintaining reliable communication between the eNodeB and the UE, ensuring optimal performance in the TCI state.\nFigure 7.2.2.1.1-1: A sequence diagram of RA-based UL timing adjustment at TCI state switch.\n\n",
