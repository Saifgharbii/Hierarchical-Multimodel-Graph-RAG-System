            "description": "Guidance to Readers of this Specification\nIn order to reduce the number of procedures in this specification certain editorial practices have been adopted. Though there are many independent factors, such as variants of S5/S8/S2b and attachment cases, these are in essence quite similar. So, rather than presenting the permutations of these factors separately and thereby needlessly repeating normative text, conventions have been adopted to combine this information in single procedures.\nThe S5 and S8 reference points in the EPC architecture have been defined to have both a GTP and PMIP variant. The GTP variant is documented in TS 23.401 [4], while the PMIP variant is documented in this specification. Every effort has been made to eliminate duplication of normative text common to both specifications. Many figures in this specification refer to procedures in TS 23.401 [4] to achieve this end. Common procedures between TS 23.401 [4] and TS 23.402 (this specification), are represented in this specification in figures by text in shaded box(es) that reference the appropriate figure and steps in TS 23.401 [4]. The details of the common steps are only captured in TS 23.401 [4].\nThe S2b reference point in the EPC architecture has also been defined to have both a GTP and PMIP variant. Both variants are documented in this specification. Every effort has been made to eliminate duplication of normative text common to both variants. Figures for the GTP variant of S2b refer to figures defined for the PMIP variant of S2b to achieve this end. Common procedures for both variants are represented in figures for GTP based S2b by text in shaded box(es) that reference the appropriate figure and steps defined for PMIP based S2b. The details of the common steps are only captured for the PMIP variant of S2b.\nAttachment cases (as discussed in clauses 6.2.1 and 7.2.1) have been combined in a single figure. The different attachment cases can be accommodated by including optional items in the flows, for instance, a vPCRF that is only employed during when a roaming case or LBO is specified.\nMultiple APN interactions may occur for many of the procedures defined in this specification. These interactions complicate the flows by introducing certain operations that may occur multiple times. Rather than produce unique flows for this purpose, we indicate where this possibility may occur in text.\n",

            "description": "This document specifies the stage 2 service description for providing IP connectivity using non-3GPP accesses to the Evolved 3GPP Packet Switched domain. In addition, for E-UTRAN and non-3GPP accesses, the specification describes the Evolved 3GPP PS Domain where the protocols between its Core Network elements are IETF-based.\nITU-T Recommendation I.130 [2] describes a three-stage method for characterisation of telecommunication services, and ITU-T Recommendation Q.65 [3] defines stage 2 of the method.\nThe specification covers both roaming and non-roaming scenarios and covers all aspects, including mobility between 3GPP and non 3GPP accesses, policy control and charging, and authentication, related to the usage of non-3GPP accesses.\nTS 23.401 [4] covers architecture aspects common to the Evolved 3GPP Packet Switched domain.\nThe procedures defined in the present document for WLAN access selection and PLMN selection replace the corresponding I-WLAN procedures specified in TS 23.234 [5].\nInterworking with 5GS is only supported for untrusted non-3GPP access using GTP-based S2b. Enhancements to support interworking with 5GS are captured in TS 23.501 [87] and TS 23.502 [88].\nThe WLAN Selection Policy specified in clause 4.8.2.1.6 also covers UEs operating in SNPN access mode as defined in TS 23.501 [87].\n",

                            "text_content": "The Mobility mechanisms supported between 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses within an operator and its roaming partner's network would depend upon operator choice.\nFor networks deploying a single IP mobility management mechanism, the statically configured mobility mechanism can be access type and/or roaming agreement specific. The information about the mechanism to be used in such scenario is expected to be provisioned into the terminal (or the UICC) and the network. IP session continuity between 3GPP and non-3GPP access types may not be provided in this case if there is a mismatch between what the UE expects and what the network supports. For example service continuity may not be possible if the user switches to a terminal supporting a different IP mobility management mechanism than provisioned in the network.\nNOTE:\tThe mismatch case where a trusted non-3GPP network or ePDG only supports DSMIPv6 and the UE does not, may lead to a situation where the UE receives a local IP address in the trusted non-3GPP access network or ePDG, but gains no PDN connectivity in the EPC. Depending on operator policy and roaming agreements, IP connectivity may be provided using this local IP address to access services (e.g. internet access) in the trusted non-3GPP network. However, any such use of the local IP address where the user traffic does not use the EPC is not described in this specification.\nIP Mobility management Selection (IPMS) consist of two components:\n-\tIP MM protocol selection between Network Based Mobility (NBM) and Host based mobility (HBM - MIPv4 orDSMIPv6).\n-\tDecision on IP address preservation if NBM is selected.\nIPMS does not relate to the selection between PMIPv6 and GTP over S5/S8/S2b/S2a.\nUpon initial attachment to a 3GPP access, no IPMS is necessary since connectivity to a PDN GW is always established with a network-based mobility mechanism.\nUpon initial attachment to a trusted non-3GPP access or ePDG and upon handover from 3GPP to a trusted non-3GPP access or ePDG, IPMS is performed before an IP address is allocated and provided to the UE.\nThe UE support for a specific IP Mobility Management protocol and/or IP address preservation mechanism for inter-access mobility may be known by the network-based on explicit indication from the UE.\nUpon attachment to a trusted non-3GPP access or ePDG, if the access network (supporting at least NBM) is not aware of the UE capabilities and the home and access network's policies allow the usage of NBM, then NBM is used for establishing connectivity for the UE to the EPC.\nWhen a NBM mechanism is used for establishing connectivity in the target access upon inter-access mobility, IP address preservation for session continuity based on NBM may take place as per PMIPv6 specification (RFC 5213 [8]) or according to clause 8.6 for GTP, and additionally based on the knowledge in the network of UE's capability (if available) to support NBM. Such knowledge may be based on an explicit indication from the UE upon handover that IP address preservation based on NBM management can be provided.\nIP address preservation for session continuity based on HBM may take place if the network is aware of the UE capability to support DSMIPv6 or MIPv4. Such knowledge may be based on an indication to the target trusted non-3GPP access or ePDG from the HSS/AAA (e.g. in case of DSMIPv6, the UE performed S2c bootstrap before moving to the target trusted non-3GPP access or ePDG). In such a case, the trusted non-3GPP access network or ePDG provides the UE with a new IP address, local to the access network if IP mobility management protocol selected is DSMIPv6. In that case, in order to get IP address preservation for session continuity, the UE shall use DSMIPv6 over S2c reference point. This IP address shall be used as a care-of address for DSMIPv6. If the IP mobility management protocol selected is MIPv4, the address provided to the UE by the non-3GPP access network is a FACoA and IP address preservation is performed over S2a using MIPv4 FACoA procedures.\nThe final decision on the mobility management mechanism is made by the HSS/AAA upon UE authentication in the trusted non-3GPP access system or ePDG (both at initial attachment and handover), based on the information it has regarding the UE, local/home network capabilities and local/home network policies. If the UE provided an explicit indication of the supported mobility mechanisms, the network shall provide an indication to the UE identifying the selected mobility management mechanism.\nSupport of different IP mobility management protocols at local/home network is known by the AAA/HSS in one of the following ways:\n-\tthrough static pre-configuration, or\n-\tthrough indication of the supported IP mobility management protocols (NBM and/or MIPv4 FA CoA mode) by the trusted non-3GPP access system or ePDG as part of the AAA exchange for UE authentication.\nUpon selecting a mobility management mechanism, as part of the AAA exchange for UE authentication in the trusted non-3GPP access system or ePDG, the HSS/AAA returns to the trusted non-3GPP access system or ePDG an indication on whether a local IP address shall be allocated to the UE, or if instead NBM shall be used to establish the connectivity, or the HSS/AAA returns to the trusted non-3GPP access system an indication that the address of the MIPv4 Foreign Agent shall be provided to the UE.\nIPMS is performed in the following scenarios:\n-\tUpon initial attach to a trusted non-3GPP access or ePDG, the IPMS is performed to decide how to establish IP connectivity for the UE.\n-\tUpon handover without optimization from a 3GPP access to a non-3GPP access, the IPMS is performed to decide how to establish IP connectivity for the UE over the trusted non-3GPP access or ePDG.\n-\tUpon change of access between a non-3GPP access and a 3GPP access or between two non-3GPP accesses, if the IP MM protocol used to provide connectivity to the UE over the trusted non-3GPP access or ePDG is a NBM protocol, then a decision is performed on whether IP address preservation is provided or not as per PMIPv6 specification, (RFC 5213 [8]) or according to clause 8.6 for GTP and additionally based on the knowledge in the network of UE's capability (if available) to support NBM.\nThe IPMS decision is performed as described in the following:\n-\tIf the UE indicates DSMIPv6 support only, and the network supports and selects DSMIPv6, the trusted non-3GPP access network or ePDG provides a local IP address to the UE to be used as CoA for DSMIPv6/S2c.\n-\tIf the UE indicates MIPv4 support only, and the network supports and selects MIPv4, then the trusted non-3GPP access network provides a FACoA to the UE.\n-\tIf the UE indicates DSMIPv6 or MIPv4 support only, and the network selects NBM for providing connectivity, then NBM is used for providing connectivity.\n-\tIf the UE does not indicate any capabilities, it is assumed that the UE is not able to support DSMIPv6 or MIPv4, and NBM is used for providing connectivity if the network supports NBM.\nOn handover to 3GPP access, UE shall request for IP address preservation by setting Request Type flag to \"handover\" during the attach procedure.\nNOTE:\tUE requests for address preservation if S2c is used over source access network or MIPv4 FACoA is used to connect over source access network or UE is capable of Network address preservation.\nWhen the UE provides an indication of its supported mobility modes either during initial attach or on handover, the UE provides such information to the entity performing IPMS during network access authentication, for trusted non-3GPP accesses, or during authentication for tunnel establishment with ePDG, for untrusted non-3GPP accesses.\nThe network then makes the decision on what mobility protocol to be used for connectivity as described in further clauses depending on the scenario.\nOn handover to non-3GPP accesses, the IPMS decision is performed as described in the following:\na.\tIf the UE only indicates NBM support between the two access technologies involved in the handover and the network supports NBM between those two access technologies involved in the handover, then NBM is used for providing connectivity, and IP address preservation is provided with S2a or S2b procedures.\nb.\tIf the UE indicates DSMIPv6 support and the network supports and selects DSMIPv6, the trusted non-3GPP access network or ePDG provides a local IP address to the UE to be used as CoA for DSMIPv6, and IP address preservation is provided with S2c procedures.\nc.\tIf the UE indicates DSMIPv6 support only and the network does not support DSMIPv6, then NBM is used for providing basic connectivity to the existing PDN GW if NBM is supported by the trusted non-3GPP access network or ePDG. In this case, the decision for IP address preservation is made as per PMIPv6 specification, (RFC 5213 [8]) or according to clause 8.6 for GTP.\nd.\tIf the UE indicates support for both NBM and DSMIPv6, and the network based on policies selects NBM to establish the connectivity, then NBM is used to establish connectivity, and IP address preservation is provided with S2a or S2b procedures.\ne.\tIf the UE indicates support for both NBM and DSMIPv6, and the network based on policies selects DSMIPv6 to establish the connectivity, then the trusted non-3GPP access network or ePDG provides a local IP address to the UE to be used as CoA for DSMIPv6, and IP address preservation is provided with S2c procedures.\nf.\tIf the UE does not indicate any capabilities, then NBM is used for establishing connectivity if NBM is supported by the trusted non-3GPP access network or ePDG. In this case, the decision for IP address preservation is made as per PMIPv6 specification, (RFC 5213 [8]) or according to clause 8.6 for GTP.\nNOTE 1:\tIn case of bullet c and f, PMIPv6 specification allows two options:\na)\tPreserve the IP address based on a timer; If the connection through the old access system is not torn down before the timer expires then a new prefix is assigned, or\nb)\tImmediately assign a new prefix.\nThis decision can be based on operator's policies.\nNOTE 2:\tIf prior to the handover, the UE was attached to a non-3GPP access with DSMIPv6, bullets a. and c. are considered not to apply.\nNOTE 3:\tThe PDN GW capability of supporting NBM or DSMIPv6 or MIPv4 should be considered in IP Mobility Mode Selection.\nThe UE indication of DSMIPv6 support may be implicit, e.g. having bootstrapped a security association via the old access network. The same applies to NBM, since the network can collect information about NBM support from other sources.\nOn handover to 3GPP access, the only decision that needs to be made is whether IP address preservation needs to be provided or not.\n",

                            "text_content": "PDN Gateway selection for non-3GPP accesses uses similar mechanisms as defined in TS 23.401 [4], with the following modification:\n-\tThe PDN Gateway selection function interacts with the 3GPP AAA Server or 3GPP AAA Proxy and uses subscriber information provided by the HSS to the 3GPP AAA Server. The HSS shall include the UE Usage Type in the UE's subscription information if any and, if included, the ePDG/TWAN shall select the PDN GW as described in TS 23.401 [4], clause 4.3.25.1. To support separate PDN GW addresses at a PDN GW for different mobility protocols (PMIP, MIPv4 or GTP), the PDN GW Selection function takes mobility protocol type into account when deriving PDN GW address by using the Domain Name Service function.\nDuring the initial authorization, PDN Gateway selection information for each of the subscribed PDNs is returned to the ePDG or the Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network. The PDN Gateway selection information includes:\n-\tThe PDN GW identity, which is a logical name (FQDN) or IP address and an APN; or\n-\tan APN and an indication whether the allocation of a PDN GW from the visited PLMN is allowed or a PDN GW from the home PLMN shall be allocated.\nThis enables the entity requiring the IP address of the PDN Gateway to proceed with selection as per the procedures defined in TS 23.401 [4], clauses 4.3.8.1 and 4.3.25.1. Once the selection has occurred, the PDN Gateway registers its association with a UE and the APN with the AAA/HSS by sending PDN GW identity, that is either its IP address (e.g. if it has a single IP address for all the mobility protocols it supports or if it only supports one mobility protocol) or its FQDN (e.g. if it has multiple IP addresses for the mobility protocols it supports), as well as information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located, to the 3GPP AAA Server or AAA Proxy only when the Access Technology Type is non-3GPP. For 3GPP access types, the MME/S4-SGSN updates the HSS with the selected PDN GW identity, as well as information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located, according to TS 23.401 [4]/TS 23.060 [21]. This permits the HSS and 3GPP AAA Server or Proxy to provide the association of the PDN Gateway identity and the related APN for the UE subsequently.\nNOTE 1:\tThe format of the information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located is defined in stage 3 specifications.\nIn the case that a UE already has assigned PDN Gateway(s), the PDN GW identity for each of the already allocated PDN Gateway(s), as well as information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located, are returned by the 3GPP AAA Server or Proxy during the authorization step. This eliminates the need to repeat PDN Gateway selection for the PDNs the UE is already connected with. The information about the PLMN in which the PGW is located allows the receiving entity to determine an appropriate APN-OI. The ePDG may use this information to determine the S2b protocol type (PMIP or GTP). The TWAN may also use this information to determine the S2a protocol type (PMIP or GTP).\nUpon mobility between 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, PDN Gateway selection information for the subsbed PDNs the UE is not yet connected with is returned to the target access system as done during initial attachment. For the PDNs the UE is already connected with transfer of PDN GW information takes place as defined below:\n-\tIf a UE attaches to a non-3GPP access and it already has assigned PDN Gateway(s) due to a previous attach in a 3GPP access, the HSS provides the PDN GW identity, as well as information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located, for each of the already allocated PDN Gateway(s) with the corresponding PDN information to the 3GPP AAA server over the SWx reference point.\n-\tIf a UE attaches to a 3GPP access and it already has an assigned PDN Gateway(s) due to a previous attach in a non-3GPP access, the HSS provides the PDN GW identity, as well as information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located, for each of the already allocated PDN Gateway(s) with the corresponding PDN information to the MME over the S6a reference point and/or S4-SGSN over the S6d reference point.\nThe HSS receives the PDN GW identity for each of the selected PDN GWs and the corresponding PDN information for a given UE, from both the 3GPP AAA Server and also from the MME/S4-SGSN, depending on the currently in-use access. The HSS is responsible for the storage of the selected PDN GW identity as described in clause 12.\nThe ePDG may be configured with the S2b protocol variant(s) on a per HPLMN granularity, or may retrieve information regarding the S2b protocol variants supported by the PDN GW (PMIP or/and GTP) from the Domain Name Service function.\nThe TWAN may be configured with the S2a protocol variant(s) on a per HPLMN granularity, or may retrieve information regarding the S2a protocol variants supported by the PDN GW (PMIP or/and GTP) from the Domain Name Service function.\nNOTE 2:\tThe location of the PDN GW selection function depends upon the type of S2 interface used for attachment and the IP mobility mechanism being used.\n-\tFor PMIPv6 on S/b, the entity requesting the PDN Gateway is the entity acting as Mobile Access Gateway (MAG).\n-\tFor GTP on S2b, the entity requesting the PDN Gateway is the ePDG.\n-\tFor GTP on S2a, the TWAG, described in clause 16.1.2, is requesting the PDN Gateway.\n-\tFor the PMIP-based S8-S2a/b chained cases, the PDN GW information is sent together with the selected Serving GW address from the 3GPP AAA proxy to the entity acting as MAG in the non-3GPP access network during access authentication and authorization. The PDN GW selection mechanism is the same as in the unchained case. The MAG function of the non-3GPP access network conveys the PDN GW address to the Serving GW as part of the PMIPv6 PBU message.\n-\tFor MIPv4 FA mode on S, the entity requesting the PDN Gateway is the entity that plays the role of the FA.\n",

This may happen if one of the following situations occurs:\n-\tThe UE has done initial network attachment on an access system supporting network-based mobility, but the PDN Gateway discovered by the UE for the S2c reference point is different from the PDN Gateway allocated at initial network attachment. In this case, to enable IP address preservation based on DSMIPv6 upon inter-system mobility, the network must trigger a PDN Gateway reallocation for the S2c reference point, to re-direct the UE to the PDN Gateway that was selected upon initial network attachment.\n-\tThe UE has done initial network attachment over S2c and, relying on DNS, has discovered a sub-optimal PDN Gateway. In this case, based on operator's policies, the network can optionally trigger a PDN Gateway reallocation to re-redirect the UE to a PDN Gateway that can provide better performance.\nPDN Gateway reallocation for the S2c reference point is triggered by the AAA/HSS during DSMIPv6 bootstrapping. For a UE's initial Attach, if the UE has selected a initial PDN GW and initiated DSMIPv6 bootstrapping:\n-\tIn non-roaming scenario, the PDN GW reports the UE Care of Address (allocated by the WLAN AN or ePDG) to the 3GPP AAA Server. According to the UE CoA and the pre-configuration, the 3GPP AAA Server finds there are other PDN GW(s) which are close to the UE, then it can initiate a PDN GW reallocation procedure (Clause 6.10 \"PDN GW reallocation upon attach on S2c\") to redirect the UE to the other PDN GW.\n-\tIn roaming with local breakout scenario, the PDN GW reports the UE Care of Address (allocated by the WLAN AN or ePDG) to the 3GPP AAA Proxy. According to the UE CoA and the pre-configuration, the 3GPP AAA Proxy finds there are other PDN GW(s) which are close to the UE, then it can initiate a PDN GW reallocation procedure (clause 6.10 \"PDN GW reallocation upon attach on S2c\") to redirect the UE to the other PDN GW.\nNOTE 2:\tWhether the selected PDN GW is closer to the UE than other PDN GW depends on the network configurations and operations, it may be geographically/topologically closer or less IP hops.\nNOTE 3:\tThis reallocation is initiated only if the UE has not yet successfully established a binding with the selected PDN GW.\nThe HSS receives the values of identity(ies) of all allocated PDN GWs and the corresponding PDN information for a given UE from the 3GPP AAA. The HSS is responsible for the storage of PDN GW identity information.\n",

The Emergency Configuration Data contain the Emergency APN which is used to derive a PDN GW, the statically configured PDN GW for the Emergency APN and optionally a fallback statically configured PDN GW, and may also contain information on the default QoS to apply to a PDN Connection for emergency services (as defined in clause 4.5.7.2.4).\nThe following procedures apply for emergency PDN connections for untrusted WLAN case:\n-\tprocedures defined in clause 7.4.3 (\"UE/ePDG-initiated Detach Procedure and UE-Requested PDN Disconnection\");\n-\tprocedures defined in clause 7.6 (\"UE-initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN\");\n-\tprocedures defined in clause 7.9.2 (\"PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation\");\n-\tprocedures defined in clause 7.10 (\"Dedicated S2b bearer activation\");\n-\tprocedures defined in clause 7.11.1 (\"PDN GW initiated bearer modification\");\n-\tprocedures defined in clause 8 (\"Handovers without Optimizations Between 3GPP Accesses and Non-3GPP IP Accesses\").\nAs part of these procedures, the UE local IP address and optionally UDP or TCP source port number (if NAT is detected) are reported from ePDG to the PDN GW. When Access Network Information reporting has been set by the PCRF, the UE local IP address and optionally UDP or TCP source port number (if NAT is detected) is reported to the PCRF.\nNOTE:\tThe UE local IP address is used by the UE for sending all IKEv2, RFC 5996 [9], messages and as the source address on the outer header of the IPsec tunnel to the ePDG.\nTo get EPC access for emergency services in case of trusted WLAN, the UE shall select a Trusted WLAN that supports emergency services.

Upon reception from the UE indication that a PDN connection for emergency services needs to be established, the ePDG/TWAG looks up its configured Emergency Configuration Data. The Emergency Configuration Data contains the Emergency APN to be used to derive a PDN GW, or may also contain the statically configured PDN GW for the Emergency APN.\nWhen a PDN GW is selected based on the Emergency APN, the PDN GW selection function described in clause 4.3.8.1 of TS 23.401 [4] for normal bearer services is applied to the Emergency APN.

The definition of the policies used by 3GPP AAA server is outside the scope of 3GPP.\nThis location information is called WLAN Location Information and contains the same information as is contained in the TWAN Identifier defined in clause 16.1.7. The Age of the WLAN Location information is provided in conjunction with the WLAN Location information.\nNOTE 2:\tIn cases where an UE may within an area move between AP(s) without the 3GPP AAA server being notified of this mobility, the WLAN Location Information can only refer to the first AP used by the UE within the area.\nThe 3GPP AAA server shall update its storage of WLAN Location Information associated with an UE when it receives WLAN Access Network location information from a WLAN AN that it considers as trustworthy for network provided location. The 3GPP AAA server shall remove its storage of WLAN Location Information associated with an UE when it becomes aware that the WLAN session of the UE is terminated or when it receives WLAN Access Network location information from a WLAN AN that it considers as not trustworthy for network provided location.\nThe ePDG shall store WLAN Location Information associated with an UE when it receives WLAN Access Network location information from the 3GPP AAA server. The ePDG shall remove its storage of WLAN Location Information associated with an UE when it receives from the 3GPP AAA server an indication that no WLAN Access Network location information is available for this UE.\nThe WLAN Location Information information and its Age, when available, are propagated by the ePDG to the PDN GW and then via PCC as defined in TS 23.203 [19]. This takes place at the UE-initiated connectivity to an initial PDN connection (Attach Procedure), at the UE-initiated connectivity to an additional PDN connection or, as described below, when the ePDG needs to send User Location Information about an already established PDN connection.\nWhen the AAA server has sent WLAN Location Information at the UE-initiated connectivity to an initial (Attach Procedure) or additional PDN connection, and when later the ePDG needs to send User location Information towards the PDN GW over S2b, the ePDG may initiate a WLAN Location Information Request to fetch the most up to date WLAN Location Information in conjunction with the age of this Information.\nFigure 4.5.7.2.8-1 illustrates the process of EPDG (Extensible Provisioning Protocol for Dynamic Location Information) retrieval in WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) to determine the location information of a device. The figure shows the interaction between the EPDG client and the EPDG server, which exchange messages to exchange and retrieve location data. The process is depicted in a sequence of steps, starting with the client sending a request to the server, followed by the server responding with the location information. The figure highlights the importance of accurate location data in wireless networks for various applications such as network optimization, resource allocation, and user experience enhancement.\nFigure 4.5.7.2.8-1: EPDG retrieval of WLAN Location Information\n0)\tWhen the 3GPP AAA server detects that the UE has moved between WLAN AN, it locally updates or removes the WLAN Location Information information and its Age it stores for the UE.\n1)\tA procedure is triggered that requires the ePDG to provide User Location Information over S2b for an already established PDN connection. The corresponding procedures are:\n-\t7.4.3\tUE/ePDG-initiated Detach Procedure and UE-Requested PDN Disconnection with GTP on S2b.\n-\t7.9.2\tPDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation with GTP on S2b.\n-\t7.10\tDedicated S2b bearer activation with GTP on S2b.\n-\t7.11\tS2b bearer modification with GTP on S2b.\n2)\tWhen the AAA server has sent WLAN Location Information at the set-up of a SWm session and the ePDG has detected a change of the outer IP address of the UE, the ePDG initiates a WLAN Location Information Request (IMSI) towards the 3GPP AAA server.\n3)\tThe 3GPP AAA server provides a WLAN Location Information Answer that may contain WLAN location information and WLAN location information Age or an indication that no WLAN location information is available. The ePDG replaces any WLAN location information andWLAN location information Age it may have stored beforehand by the information received from the 3GPP AAA server. When the WLAN Location Information Answer contains an indication that no WLAN location information is available, the ePDG removes any WLAN location information and WLAN location information Age it may have stored beforehand about the UE.\n4)\tThe ePDG issues S2b signalling with User Location Information. The User Location Information shall include UE local IP address and optionally UDP or TCP source port number (if NAT is detected). The User Location Information includes WLAN Location Information (and its Age) only when the ePDG has such information currently available about the UE. When the PDN GW receives no WLAN Location Information from the ePDG it shall delete any such information it may have stored for the PDN connection.\n5)\tIf requested by the PCRF the PDN GW forwards to the PCRF following information extracted from User Location Information it may have received from the ePDG:\n-\tThe UE local IP address and optionally UDP or TCP source port number (if NAT is detected).\n-\tWLAN location information in conjunction with the Age of this information,\nWhen the PCRF receives no WLAN location information from the PDN GW within User Location Information the WLAN location information is considered as not any longer valid.\nIf the UE needs to provide location information when requesting an emergency session, the UE may determine its location by using its own implementation-specific means (e.g. by using its GPS receiver). If, however, the UE cannot determine its location by its own means, the UE may retrieve its location from a WLAN AP, prior or after association with the AP, by requesting the Civic Location ANQP element, the Geospatial Location ANQP element or both as specified in IEEE Std 802.11-2012 [64]), using ANQP procedures described in HS2.0 Rel-2 specification [75].\nNOTE:\tLocation determination based on WLAN ANQP procedures should be considered as less reliable than e.g. location determination based on GPS receiver.\nSeamless PS handover between WLAN and 3GPP EPC is supported if the following conditions are satisfied:\n-\tFor UEs without UICC or with an unauthenticated IMSI and for authenticated roaming UEs, the ePDG/TWAG is configured with a static PDN GW identity and optionally a fallback PDN GW identity as part of the Emergency Configuration Data.\n-\tWhen the UE initiates an Emergency Attach with handover indication to the MME, the MME uses the static PDN GW identity locally configured instead of querying the HSS as described in TS 23.401 [4].\n-\tFor authenticated non-roaming UEs, based on operator policy, the ePDG/TWAG may select a PDN GW based on DNS look up for the emergency APN, which is configured in the Emergency Configuration Data. In such case:\n-\tDuring the initial establishment of the PDN connection for emergency services, the \"PDN GW currently in use for emergency services\", which comprises the PDN GW address and an indication that the PDN connection is for emergency services is provided to the HSS by the PDN GW via the 3GPP AAA server over S6b and SWx as described in clause 7.2.5 for untrusted WLAN and clauses 16.2.1a and 16.8.1 for trusted WLAN and by the MME over S6a as described in TS 23.401 [4]. The HSS stores it as a specific data \"PDN GW currently in use for emergency services\", not associated with any APN. If the HSS detects that the UE is attached to the other access (3GPP or WLAN), the HSS updates the corresponding serving node (MME, ePDG or TWAN) with the \"PDN GW currently in use for emergency services\".\n-\tDuring the handover procedure from WLAN to 3GPP EPC, the \"PDN GW currently in use for emergency services\" information is provided by the HSS as part of the subscription information sent to the MME over S6a as described in clause 8.6.1.1 for untrusted WLAN and clause 16.11 for trusted WLAN.\n-\tDuring the handover procedure from 3GPP EPC to WLAN, the \"PDN GW currently in use for emergency services\" information is provided by the HSS as part of the subscription information sent to the ePDG / TWAG via the 3GPP AAA server over SWx and SWm / STa as described in clause 8.6.2.1 for untrusted WLAN and clauses 16.10.1.1 and 16.10.2.1 for trusted WLAN.\n-\tAlternatively for non-roaming authenticated UEs, based on operator policy (e.g. the network supports handovers to/from HRPD), the ePDG/TWAG may be configured with a static PDN GW identity as part of the Emergency Configuration Data. In such case, when the UE initiates an Emergency Attach with handover indication to the MME, the MME uses the static PDN GW identity locally configured instead of querying the HSS as described in TS 23.401 [4].\n",

This case does not present any architecture differences from the GTP based S5/S8 described in clause 5.3.1.2.1 of TS 23.401 [4]. In this case, the Serving GW shall request IPv4 address in the Proxy Binding Update. Then the IPv4 address is assigned by the PDN GW and returned to the Serving Gateway in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement.\n-\tIf initial and handover attach and deferred IPv4 address allocation is used, the IPv4 address allocation and IPv4 parameter configuration via DHCPv4 according to RFC 2131 [28] and RFC 4039 [29] procedure does not present any architecture differences from the GTP based S5/S8 described in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.3.1.2.4, except that the Serving GW shall have DHCPv4 relay agent functionality. The Serving GW shall request IPv4 address in the Proxy Binding Update. Then the IPv4 address is assigned by the PDN GW and returned to the Serving Gateway in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement. The PDN GW shall also send the DHCPv4 Address Allocation Procedure Indication in the same Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message. In this case, the UE IPv4 address assigned by the PDN GW is not provided as part of the default bearer activation procedures to the UE. The Serving GW replaces the IPv4 address assigned by the PDN GW to 0.0.0.0 in the response message to the MME. The MME then forwards the 0.0.0.0 address to the UE. After the default bearer establishment procedure is completed, the UE uses the connectivity with the EPS and initiates the IPv4 address allocation on its own using DHCPv4 as specified in figure 4.7.1-1. The IPv4 address provided to the UE by DHCPv4 procedure shall correspond to the value provided in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message.\n-\tIf the IPv4 address is allocated by using DHCPv4 procedure, then at any time after the UE releases the IPv4 address using DHCPv4 or the IPv4 address lease time expires, the PDN GW initiates the \"PDN-GW initiated PDN-disconnection\" procedure for the given PDN connection. The same IPv4 address shall not be allocated to another UE immediately.\n-\tIf the PDN Type associated with the PDN connection is IPv6:\n-\tIPv6 network prefix allocation via IPv6 Stateless Address auto-configuration: The IPv6 network prefix is assigned by the PDN GW and returned to the Serving Gateway in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement. The Serving GW shall advertise the same information as the PDN GW would advertise with GTP based S5/S8. To ensure that link-local address generated by the UE does not collide with the link-local address of the Serving GW, the PDN GW shall provide an interface identifier to the UE and the UE shall use this interface identifier to configure its link-local address. For stateless address auto-configuration however, the UE can choose any interface identifier to generate IPv6 address, other than link-local, without involving the network. The PDN GW shall also provide a link-local address to the Serving GW and the Serving GW shall use the link-local address on the access link shared with the UE. In the case of PMIP-S5/S8 because any prefix that the Serving GW will advertise to the UE is unique, there is no need for the UE to perform Duplicate Address Detection for global uniqueness for any IPv6 address configured from the allocated IPv6 network prefix. However, the Serving GW shall respond with Neighbor Advertisement upon receiving Neighbor Solicitation messages from a given UE. For example, the UE may perform Neighbor Unreachability Detection towards the Serving GW, the Serving GW supports the DAD related functionality similar to that supported by PDN GW in the case of GTP based S5/S8 described in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.3.1.2.2. Otherwise the PDN GW has the same functions as it is defined in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.3.1.2.2.\n-\tIPv6 parameter configuration via Stateless DHCPv6 procedure does not present any architecture differences from the GTP based S5/S8 described in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.3.1.2.3, except that the Serving GW shall have DHCPv6 relay agent functionality. The P-GW notifies the UE with the same DNSv6 information as was provided via PCO during the PDN connection establishment procedure, e.g. Attach, if DHCPv6 procedure is performed by the UE.\n-\tIf sent, the router solicitation from the UE comes subsequent to the Attach procedure, as shown in Figure 4.7.1-2. The IPv6 network prefix assigned in the PMIP Binding Acknowledgement is sent in the Router Advertisement.\n-\tIf the PDN type associated with the PDN connection is IPv4v6:\n-\tThe IPv6 network prefix allocation via IPv6 Stateless Address auto-configuration procedure and IPv6 parameter configuration via Stateless DHCPv6 procedure are the same as for PDN type IPv6 defined in pervious bullets.\n-\tIf initial attach and deferred IPv4 address allocation is used, the Serving GW shall request both IPv6 network prefix and IPv4 address in the Proxy Binding Update. In this case no IPv4 address is assigned by the PDN GW during the attach procedure. Only IPv6 network prefix is returned to the Serving Gateway in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement. The PDN GW shall also send the DHCPv4 Address Allocation Procedure Indication in the same PBA message. Then the Serving GW shall respond to the UE by setting the IPv4 PDN Address to 0.0.0.0. The UE may obtain an IPv4 address subsequently, by initiating DHCPv4 procedure as specified in figure 4.7.1-1.\n-\tIf initial attach and deferred IPv4 address allocation is not used, the Serving GW shall request both IPv6 network prefix and IPv4 address in the Proxy Binding Update. In this case IPv4 address is assigned by the PDN GW during the attach procedure. IPv6 network prefix and IPv4 address is returned to the Serving Gateway in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement. The Serving GW shall deliver IPv4 address to the UE.\n-\tFor handover attach (i.e. Request Type set to \"handover\"), the Serving GW shall request both IPv6 network prefix and IPv4 address in the Proxy Binding Update, irrespective of whether the UE requested deferred IPv4 address or not. The previously assigned IPv6 network prefix and/or IPv4 address are returned to the Serving Gateway in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement during the handover attach procedure. If deferred IPv4 address allocation is used for this PDN connection, the PDN GW shall also send the DHCPv4 Address Allocation Procedure Indication in the same PBA message. In this case, the UE IPv4 address is not provided as part of the default bearer activation procedures to the UE. The Serving GW shall respond to the MME by setting the PDN Address to 0.0.0.0. The MME then forwards the 0.0.0.0 address to the UE. After the default bearer establishment procedure is completed, the UE uses the connectivity with the EPS and may renew the IPv4 address allocation using DHCPv4. The IPv4 Address provided to the UE by subsequent DHCPv4, when initiated by the UE, must correspond to the value provided in the PBA.\n-\tIf the IPv4 address is provided to the UE by using DHCPv4 procedure, then at any time after the UE releases the IPv4 address using DHCPv4 or IPv4 address lease time expires, the PDN GW initiates the \"PDN Gateway initiated IPv4 address Delete\" procedure to delete the IPv4 address from the PDN connection and bearer contexts. The same IPv4 address shall not be allocated to another UE immediately.\n-\tIf an external PDN Address Allocation is needed, the PDN GW follows the same procedures defined in TS 23.401 [4] to obtain the external IP address after the PBU is received and before the PBA is sent.\nFigure 4.7.1-1 illustrates the IPv4 address allocation process in a network using DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) with a DHCP server that is collocated with the PDN Gateway (Policy and Charging Gateway) and a DHCP Relay in the Serving Gateway. The figure depicts the interaction between the various components involved in the process, including the DHCP server, PDN GW, and Serving GW. The DHCP server is responsible for assigning IP addresses to devices in the network, while the PDN GW and Serving GW play crucial roles in managing and routing network traffic. The figure highlights the importance of these components in ensuring efficient and secure IP address allocation within the network.\nFigure 4.7.1-1: IPv4 Address Allocation using DHCP with DHCP Server Collocated with the PDN GW and DHCP Relay in the Serving GW\n1.\tIf the PDN type associated with the PDN connection is IPv4v6 or IPv4, after the default bearer is setup, the UE sends a DHCPv4 Discovery message in broadcast to the network to find available servers.\nSteps 2-3 and 11-14 are only executed if the PDN type is IPv4v6 and IPv4 address was not allocated by the PDN GW in the initial attach procedure. The interaction of PBU messages (2-3) with DHCPv4 related messages (1, 4-10) is based on RFC 5844 [17].\n2.\tThe Serving GW sends a Proxy Binding Update (MN NAI, APN, UE Address Info) to the PDN GW in order to request the new IPv4 address and update the current registration. The MN NAI identifies the UE for whom the message is being sent. To request for IPv4 address for the UE, the UE Address Information should contain IPv4 address option set to 0.0.0.0, and the HNP shall be set to the HNP of the IP-CAN Session.\n3.\tThe PDN GW responds with a PMIPv6 Binding Acknowledgement (MN NAI, UE Address Info) message to the Serving GW. The MN NAI is identical to the MN NAI sent in the Proxy Binding Update. The PDN GW takes into account the request from Serving GW and the policies of operator when the PDN GW allocates the UE Address Info. The UE address info returns the assigned IPv4 Address and/or IPv6 prefix previously assigned to the UE during attach, if one was requested in the PMIPv6 Proxy Binding Update message. Otherwise, the PDN GW validates the addresses and returns in the UE Address Info IE the IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix received in the Proxy Binding Update message.\n4.\tUpon receiving the DHCPv4 Discovery message, the Serving GW acting as a relay agent shall add its address in the GIADDR option and add the assigned UE IPv4 address (received from PDN GW at the PBA message), if available in the \"Address Request\" option, and relay the message in unicast within the PMIPv6 tunnel to PDN GW acting as a DHCPv4 server.\n5.\tWhen receiving the DHCPv4 Discovery message, the PDN GW should verify the GIADDR option. Then the PDN GW uses \"Address Request\" option and/or the PMIPv6 tunnel on which the DHCPv4 message is received to identify the UE binding and update it with the 'client identifier' and 'chaddr' combination for subsequent DHCPv4 procedure. After that the PDN GW extends an IPv4 lease offer and sending the DHCPv4 Offer with the assigned UE IPv4 address.\n6.\tThe Serving GW acting as DHCPv4 relay agent relays the DHCPv4 message to the UE.\n7.\tWhen the UE receives the lease offer, it sends a DHCPREQUEST message containing the received IPv4 address.\n8.\tThe Serving GW acting as DHCPv4 relay agent relays the DHCPv4 message to the PDN GW.\n9.\tWhen the PDN GW receives the DHCPREQUEST message from the UE, it sends a DHCPACK packet to the UE. This message includes the lease duration and any other configuration information that the client might have requested.\n10.\tThe Serving GW acting as DHCPv4 relay agent relays the DHCPv4 message to the UE.\nWhen receiving the DHCPACK message, the UE completes TCP/IP configuration process.\n11.\tIn case a new IPv4 address is allocated, the PDN-GW initiates the PCEF initiated IP-CAN session modification procedure as described in TS 23.203 [19] to inform the PCRF of the IPv4 address allocated to the UE. If PCC rules have changed the PCRF provides the updated PCC rules to the PDN-GW as part of this procedure.\n12.\tIn case QoS rules have to be modified, e.g. change of SDF filters, the PCRF initiates a GW Control and QoS rules provision procedure as described in TS 23.203 [19] to inform the S-GW of the updated QoS rules.\n13.\tThe S-GW initiates the \"Bearer Modification Procedure without bearer QoS update\" as described in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.4.3, between steps (A) and (B).\n14.\tThe S-GW informs the PCRF of the success of the QoS rules enforcement, thus ending the GW Control and QoS rules provision procedure described in TS 23.203 [19].\nThe PDN GW shall discard the unicast DHCPv4 Discovery or Request message with an empty or unknown GIADDR option, if the assigned UE IPv4 address is not delivered to the UE yet.\nNOTE 1:\tThe DHCPv4 client may skip DHCPv4 Discovery phase, and send DHCPv4 Request message in broadcast as the first message. In this case, the Serving GW acting as a relay agent shall add its address in the GIADDR option and add the assigned UE IPv4 address (received from PDN GW in the PBA message) in the \"Address Request\" option if one was provided in the attach procedure, and relay the message in unicast within the PMIPv6 tunnel to PDN GW acting as a DHCPv4 server.\nNOTE 2:\tAfter releasing the IPv4 address using DHCPv4 Release procedure, UE can request an IPv4 address for the same PDN connection subsequently.\nNOTE 3:\tAllocation of IP address from an external PDN using Radius or Diameter requires the \"Proxy Binding Update\" of PMIPv6 to carry the relevant PCO that is transported by GTP.\nFigure 4.7.1-2 illustrates the process of IPv6 prefix allocation after the Point of Presence (PoP) connection setup procedure. The figure depicts the hierarchical network structure, starting from the customer premises equipment (CPE) and extending to the service provider network (SPN). The figure shows the allocation of global unicast and multicast IPv6 addresses, with the use of a /64 prefix for the customer's local network and a /56 prefix for the service provider's network. The figure also highlights the use of Network Address Translation (NAT) and the establishment of a Point-to-Point (P2P) connection between the customer's CPE and the service provider's PoP. The figure demonstrates the process of prefix delegation and the use of a /64 prefix for the service provider's network, as well as the establishment of a /56 prefix for the customer's local network. The figure also shows the use of a /64 prefix for the service provider's network and the establishment of a /56 prefix for the customer's local network.\nFigure 4.7.1-2: IPv6 Prefix allocation after the PDN connection setup procedure\n1.\tA PDN connection is setup over 3GPP access, after the E-UTRAN initial Attach with PMIP-based S5/S8 procedure as defined in clause 5.2, UE requested PDN connectivity as defined in clause 5.6.1, or intra-3GPP access handover with Serving GW relocation as defined in clause 5.7, or handover from non-3GPP IP Access with S2a/S2b to 3GPP Access with PMIPv6 on S5/S8 as defined in clause 8.2.1.2 or 8.2.1.4.\n2.\tIf the PDN type associated with the PDN connection is IPv4v6 or IPv6, the UE may send a Router Solicitation message to the network to solicit a Router Advertisement message.\n3.\tUpon receiving the Route Solicitation message or after the PDN connection setup procedure, the Serving GW shall send an IPv6 Router Advertisement message as specified in IETF RFC 4862 [58] to the UE for PDN connection type IPv4v6 or IPv6 (i.e. the Serving GW acts as an advertising interface as specified in IETF RFC 4861 [38] for the PDN connection type IPv4v6 or IPv6). The Router Advertisement messages shall contain the assigned IPv6 prefix received in the PMIPv6 Binding Acknowledgement message. After the UE has received the Router Advertisement message, it constructs a full IPv6 address via IPv6 Stateless Address autoconfiguration in accordance with IETF RFC 4862 [58]. However, the UE shall not use any identifiers defined in TS 23.003 [16] as the basis for generating the interface identifier. For privacy, the UE may change the interface identifier used to generate full IPv6 address, as defined in TS 23.221 [60] without involving the network.\nNOTE 4:\tIn order to renew the allocated IPv6 prefix, the Serving GW sends an IPv6 Router Advertisement (solicited or unsolicited) to the UE i.e. the Serving GW acts as an advertising interface as specified in IETF RFC 4861 [38] for the PDN connection type IPv4v6 or IPv6.\nWhen sending the IPv6 Router Advertisement message, the Serving GW may trigger the paging (e.g. by sending a Downlink Data Notification message to the MME) if the UE is in idle state.\n",

The PDN, which is the network that connects the devices to the Internet, is shown at the bottom of the figure. The figure also shows the process of address allocation, with the DHCP server sending an offer to a device, which then responds with a request, and the MAG assigns the requested IP address to the device.

                            "text_content": "Access network selection and traffic steering between 3GPP access and WLAN is supported using ANDSF and is also supported using RAN rule procedures without ANDSF. Clause 4.8 focuses on Network Discovery and Selection using ANDSF. Access network selection and traffic steering using RAN rules when ANDSF is not applied is described in TS 23.401 [4], clause 4.3.23 and TS 23.060 [21], clause 5.3.21, as well as in E-UTRAN and UTRAN specifications as referenced therein. Coexistence between ANDSF and RAN rules is described in clause 4.8.6.4.\nThe following principles apply when the UE is registered in the Home PLMN or in a PLMN which is equivalent to the home PLMN and when both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses are available or when multiple non-3GPP accesses are available:\n-\tThe EPS network may provide the UE with assistance data/policies about available accesses located in the Home PLMN or in a PLMN equivalent to the Home PLMN, to allow the UE to scan for accesses and select an access.\n-\tIf the UE is capable of routing different IP flows to the same PDN connection through different access networks (see TS 23.261 [55]), the EPS network shall allow the operator to influence the access where a specific IP flow shall be routed.\n-\tIf the UE is capable of routing different simultaneously active PDN connections through different access networks, the EPS network shall allow the operator to influence the access where a specific PDN connection shall be routed.\n-\tAssistance data/policies are provided only after establishing secure communication, as specified in TS 33.402 [45].\n-\tThe assistance data/policies provided to UE may depend on the UE's subscription data.\n-\tThe EPS network allows the operator to influence the access that the UE shall handover to (when in active mode) or re-select (when in idle mode).\n-\tMulti-access network discovery and selection works for both single-radio and multiple- radio terminals. For the case of multiple-radio terminals, multi-access network discovery and selection works without requiring all radios supported by the UE to be switched on.\n-\tNo architectural impact is foreseen for network selection upon initial network attachment.\n-\tThe UE may provide information to the network for the retrieval of the assistance data/policies.\nThe following principles apply when the UE is registered in a Visited PLMN (VPLMN) and when both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses are available or when multiple non-3GPP accesses are available:\n-\tThe VPLMN shall be able to provide Access Network Discovery information only for 3GPP and non-3GPP access networks that provide connectivity to the VPLMN or to a PLMN equivalent to the VPLMN, or to both.\n-\tThe VPLMN shall be able to provide to a roaming UE Inter-System Mobility Policies and/or Inter System Routing Policies (see clause 4.8.2.1). Such policies shall be valid only in the VLPMN or in a PLMN equivalent to the VPLMN, as per roaming agreements.\n-\tThe Home PLMN (HPLMN) shall be able to provide to a roaming UE Access Network Discovery information for 3GPP and non-3GPP access networks that provide connectivity to the HPLMN or to a PLMN equivalent to the HPLMN, or to both.\n-\tThe HPLMN shall be able to provide to a roaming UE Inter-System Mobility Policies and/or Inter System Routing Policies.\n-\tWhen the UE receives Inter System Routing Policies from the HPLMN and the VPLMN, it shall select the active rule according to clause 4.8.2a.1.\n-\tWhen the UE receives Inter System Mobility Policies from the HPLMN and the VPLMN, it shall select the active rule according to clause 4.8.2a.1.\n-\tThe VPLMN shall not provide Inter-APN Routing Policies, and the UE shall ignore any Inter-APN Routing Policy, which is delivered by a VPLMN.\nThe multi-access network discovery and selection mechanism shall not interfere with the existing 3GPP PLMN selection mechanisms used for the 3GPP Access Technologies (specified in TS 23.122 [53]) and with the existing 3GPP2 network selection mechanisms. The multi-access network discovery and selection procedures defined in this document include a WLAN access selection procedure and a PLMN selection procedure for WLAN access (see clause 4.8.2b), which are different from and shall not be used in conjuction with the procedures for I-WLAN access (specified in TS 23.234 [5]). For WLAN access selection and PLMN selection, the procedures defined in the present document replace I-WLAN procedures specified in TS 23.234 [5].\nThe ANDSF's policy and the UE implementation shall ensure that PLMN changes are not conducted more often than the time stored in the USIM (in EFHPPLMN, see TS 31.102 [46]) for the \"periodic network selection attempts\" specified in TS 22.011 [47].\nNOTE:\tA change between the HPLMN and another PLMN equivalent to the HPLMN can be triggered by the ANDSF, but is not considered a PLMN reselection.\n",

The support and the use of these functions and interfaces are optional.\nFigure 4.8.1.1-1 illustrates the non-roaming architecture for access network discovery support functions, showcasing the various components involved in the process. The figure depicts the discovery of access network support functions, which are essential for maintaining network connectivity and ensuring seamless user experience. Key elements include the discovery agent, which initiates the discovery process, and the support function server, which responds to the agent's queries. The figure also highlights the role of the network element manager, which coordinates the interaction between the discovery agent and the support function server. The overall architecture emphasizes the importance of efficient communication and coordination among these components to ensure optimal network performance.\nFigure 4.8.1.1-1: Non-Roaming Architecture for Access Network Discovery Support Functions\nFigure 4.8.1.1-2 illustrates the roaming architecture for access network discovery support functions, showcasing the interaction between the home network, the mobile network, and the discovery support function. The figure highlights the role of the home network's discovery support function in identifying the mobile network's access network discovery support function, which in turn communicates with the mobile network's home network discovery support function. This exchange of information enables seamless handover between the home and mobile networks, ensuring uninterrupted connectivity for roaming users.\nFigure 4.8.1.1-2: Roaming Architecture for Access Network Discovery Support Functions\nThe architecture is based on a new network element called Access Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF). An ANDSF element located in the home PLMN of a UE is referred to as the Home-ANDSF (H-ANDSF) for this UE, whereas an ANDSF element located in the visited PLMN of a UE is referred to as the Visited-ANDSF (V-ANDSF) for this UE. Unless otherwise specified, the term ANDSF is used to refer to both an H-ANDSF and a V-ANDSF. Details about the ANDSF functionality and its interaction with the UE are provided in clause 4.8.2.1.\nThe ANDSF is an optional element in the network architecture and thus a UE may or may not be able to interact with an H-ANDSF and/or with a V-ANDSF.\nThe UE-ANDSF interaction can take place via non-seamless WLAN offload (see clause 4.1.5) or via any 3GPP or non-3GPP access technology that can be used by the UE to access EPC.\nNOTE:\tANDSF push interactions might not always be possible via non-seamless WLAN offload.\n",

                            "text_content": "The ANDSF contains data management and control functionality necessary to provide network discovery and selection assistance data as per operators' policy. The ANDSF shall respond to UE requests for access network discovery information (pull mode operation) and may be able to initiate data transfer to the UE (push mode operation), based on network triggers or as a result of previous communication with the UE.\nNOTE 1:\tIn this Release, the OMA DM Push mechanism may not work in all possible scenarios and the ANDSF may not always be able to initiate a session to the UE.\nNOTE 2:\tThe usage of ANDSF capabilities is intended for scenarios where access-network level solutions are not sufficient for the UE to perform Network Discovery and Selection of non-3GPP technologies according to operator policies.\nThe ANDSF shall comply with regulatory requirements pertaining to the privacy and confidentiality of user location information.\nSubject to operator's configuration, the ANDSF may obtain the permanent UE identity, e.g. based on the security solution specified in TS 33.402 [45].\nThe H ANDSF in the subscriber's home operator network may interact with other databases such as the HSS user profile information residing in subscriber's home operator network. Details of such interaction with these databases are not described in this Release of the specifications.\nThe ANDSF shall be able to provide various types of information, e.g. inter-system mobility policy, network access discovery information, etc. These types of information are specified in the following clauses.\nThe ANDSF may provide to UE all types of information or only one of them.\nThe H-ANDSF selects the types of information to be delivered to the UE according to the operator requirements and the roaming agreements. If the permanent UE identity is known to the H-ANDSF, and subject to operator's configuration, the available subscription data (e.g. the list of access networks, or access technology types, the UE is authorized to use, etc.) may also be used by the H-ANDSF for selecting the inter-system mobility policies, the access network discovery information, the inter-system routing policies and the inter-APN routing policies.\nThe V-ANDSF selects the types of information to be delivered to the UE according to the operator requirements and the roaming agreements. However, the V-ANDSF shall not deliver IARP policy (see clause 4.8.2.1.5) to a roaming UE.\nThe ANDSF shall be able to limit the amount of information provided to the UE based e.g. on the UE's current location, UE capabilities, etc. The ANDSF shall be able to limit the load caused by the UE initiated requests towards the ANDSF.\nThe information provided by ANDSF may also be pre-configured by the home operator on the ME or provisioned on the UICC. The UE shall use the ANDSF information in the following order:\n1)\tANDSF information provided by the ANSDF server to the ME;\n2)\tANDSF information configured on the UICC;\n3)\tANDSF information pre-configured on the ME.\nThe visited operator cannot pre-configure ANDSF information in the UE.\nThe Inter-System Mobility Policy (ISMP) is a set of operator-defined rules that affect the inter-system mobility decisions taken by the UE. The UE uses the inter-system mobility policy when it can route IP traffic only over a single radio access interface at a given time (e.g. is neither IFOM nor MAPCON capable or its IFOM and MAPCON capabilities are disabled) in order to select the most preferable access technology type or access network that should be used to connect to EPC.\nThe inter-system mobility policy may be provisioned in the UE and may be updated by the ANDSF based on network triggers or after receiving a UE request for network discovery and selection information.\nEach ISMP rule includes the following information:\n-\tValidity conditions, i.e. conditions indicating when the rule is valid (such conditions may include e.g. a time duration, a location area, etc.).\n-\tA prioritized list of access technologies or access network that indicate the order in which they are preferred or restricted for EPC connectivity.\n-\tA rule priority that indicates the priority of this rule with respect to other ISMP rules provided by the same PLMN.\nFor example, an ISMP rule may indicate that 3GPP access is preferable to WLAN access for EPC connectivity. When this rule is applied, inter-system handover from 3GPP access to WLAN access is not allowed. The rule may also indicate e.g. that WiMAX access is more preferable to WLAN access.\nNOTE:\tThe inter-system mobility policy does not indicate the most preferable access network or access technology type that should be used to access CS services.\nThe home operator may provide ISMP rules to UE via the H-ANDSF or may pre-configure the UE with ISMP rules. The ISMP rules provided to UE via the H-ANDSF shall take precedence over the pre-configured ISMP rules in the UE.\nUpon UE request, the ANDSF may provide a list of access networks available in the vicinity of the UE for all the access technology types requested by the UE (if any requested).\nThe ANDSF provides information for access networks that are available to the UE including:\n-\tthe access technology type (e.g. WLAN, WiMAX).\n-\tthe radio access network identifier (e.g. the SSID of a WLAN).\n-\tother technology specific information, e.g. one or more carrier frequencies.\n-\tvalidity conditions, i.e. conditions indicating when the provided access network discovery information is valid (such conditions may include e.g. a location).\nThe UE may retain and use the access network discovery information provided by the ANDSF until new/updated information is retrieved.\nThe Inter-System Routing Policy (ISRP) is a set of operator-defined rules that determine how the UE should route IP traffic across multiple radio access interfaces. The ANDSF may provide a list of ISRP rules to the UE independently of the UE capability to route IP traffic simultaneously over multiple radio access interfaces. The UE uses the ISRP rules when it can route IP traffic simultaneously over multiple radio access interfaces (e.g. it is an IFOM capable UE with the IFOM capability enabled or a MAPCON capable UE with the MAPCON capability enabled) in order to meet the operator routing / offload preferences by:\n(i)\tdeciding when an access technology type / access network is restricted for a specific IP traffic flow and/or a specific APN; and\n(ii)\tselecting the most preferable access technologies / access networks which should be used by the UE when available to route IP traffic that matches specific criteria (e.g. all traffic to a specific APN, or all traffic belonging to a specific IP flow, or all traffic of a specific application, etc).\nThe inter-system routing policy may be provisioned in the UE and may be updated by the ANDSF based on network triggers or after receiving a UE request for network discovery and selection information.\nEach ISRP rule includes the following information:\n-\tRules for IFOM: Each one of these rules identifies a prioritised list of access technologies / access networks which should be used by the UE when available to route traffic that matches specific IP traffic filters on a specific APN or on any APN. A rule for IFOM can also identify which radio accesses are restricted for traffic that matches specific IP traffic filters on aspecific APN (e.g. WLAN is not allowed for RTP/RTCP traffic flows on APN-x) or on any APN;\n-\tEach rule for IFOM contains one or more IP traffic filters (to match specific IP traffic), a prioritised list of access technologies / access networks, a rule priority and, optionally, validity conditions that indicate when the rule is valid. Each IP traffic filter may identify traffic based on destination address, transport protocol, destination/source port numbers, DSCP or Traffic Class, destination domain name and application identity.\nNOTE 1:\tIP traffic filters in ANDSF policies are applied in the UE for uplink traffic. Thus the source port in this context is the source port within the IP packet sent by the UE; the destination address and port are the destination address and port in the IP packets sent by the UE.\n-\tRules for MAPCON: Each one of these rules identifies a prioritised list of access technologies / access networks which should be used by the UE when available to route PDN connections to specific APNs. A rule for MAPCON can also identify which radio accesses are restricted for PDN connections to specific APNs (e.g. WLAN is not allowed for PDN connection to APN-x);\n-\tEach rule for MAPCON contains an APN value, a prioritised list of access technologies / access networks, a rule priority and, optionally, validity conditions that indicate when the rule is valid. When no APN value is contained, the rule applies to any APN.\n-\tRules for Non-seamless WLAN Offload (NSWO) specified in clause 4.1.5: Each one of these rules identifies which traffic shall or shall not be non-seamlessly offloaded to a WLAN when available. It shall be possible to restrict certain traffic from using non-seamless WLAN offload only in specific WLAN access networks or in all WLAN access networks. Similarly, it shall be possible to permit certain traffic to use non-seamless WLAN offload only in specific WLAN access networks or in all WLAN access networks.\n-\tEach rule for NSWO contains one or more IP traffic filters (to match specific IP traffic), a rule priority and, optionally, validity conditions that indicate when the rule is valid. Each IP traffic filter may identify traffic based on destination address, transport protocol, destination/source port numbers, DSCP or Traffic Class, destination domain name and application identity.\nThe prioritised list of access technologies included in the rules for IFOM and MAPCON may contain 3GPP access, WLAN access as well as specific 3GPP RATs such as GERAN, UTRAN and E-UTRAN. The order of the access technologies in this list allows the operator to prioritize specific 3GPP RATs with respect to WLAN access. The UE shall use the prioritised list of access technologies in these rules only for IP routing and PDN connection establishment. The UE shall not use this prioritised list for 3GPP RAT selection.\nNOTE 2:\tFor example, if the UE camps on UTRAN and the prioritised list of access networks in the active IFOM rule indicates that E-UTRAN has the highest priority for an IP flow, this rule does not trigger the UE to re-select to E-UTRAN for routing the IP flow.\nIf more than one valid rule for IFOM and non-seamless WLAN offload match a specific IP traffic flow, the UE applies the rule with the highest rule priority.\nThe home operator may provide ISRP rules to UE via the H-ANDSF or may pre-configure the UE with ISRP rules. The ISRP rules provided to UE via the H-ANDSF shall take precedence over the pre-configured ISRP rules in the UE.\nThe Inter-APN Routing Policy (IARP) is a set of operator-defined rules that determine which traffic should be routed across different PDN connections and which traffic should be non-seamlessly offloaded to WLAN (as defined in clause 4.1.5). These rules can be provisioned by the H-ANDSF only. If the UE receives IARP rules from the V-ANDSF, the UE shall ignore them. An Inter-APN routing capable UE selects an existing IP interface to route IP flows based on the received / provisioned IARP rules and user preferences. This IP interface is either associated with a specific APN or is used for non-seamless WLAN offload (NSWO).\nNOTE 1:\tIP interfaces not associated with an APN and not used for NSWO are considered outside the scope of IARP. Such interfaces could include e.g. an IP interface to a tethering device connected to UE over USB, or an IP interface corresponding to an enterprise VPN connection over WLAN, etc. The scenario where multiple IP interfaces are associated with the same APN is also considered outside the scope of IARP.\nEach IARP rule includes the following information:\n-\tRules for APN: Each one of these rules identifies a prioritised list of APNs which should be used by the UE to route traffic that matches specified IP traffic filters. A rule for APN can also identify which APNs are restricted for traffic that matches specified IP traffic filters.\n-\tEach rule for APN contains one or more IP traffic filters (to match specific IP traffic), a prioritized list of APNs, a rule priority and, optionally, validity conditions that indicate when the rule is valid. Each IP traffic filter may identify traffic based on destination address, transport protocol, destination/source port numbers, DSCP or Traffic Class, destination domain name and application identity. The rule priority indicates the priority of the rule for APN with respect to other rules inside the same IARP rule.\n-\tRules for NSWO: Each one of these rules identifies which traffic shall or shall not be non-seamlessly offloaded to a WLAN when available. It shall be possible to restrict certain traffic from using non-seamless WLAN offload only in specific WLAN access networks or in all WLAN access networks. Similarly, it shall be possible to permit certain traffic to use non-seamless WLAN offload only in specific WLAN access networks or in all WLAN access networks.\n-\tEach rule for NSWO contains one or more IP traffic filters (to match specific IP traffic), a rule priority and, optionally, validity conditions that indicate when the rule is valid. Each IP traffic filter may identify traffic based on destination address, transport protocol, destination/source port numbers, DSCP or Traffic Class, destination domain name and application identity. The rule priority indicates the priority of the rule for NSWO with respect to other rules inside the same IARP rule.\nAn IARP for APN rule can be applied only when it steers IP traffic to an existing (i.e. already established) PDN connection. When no APN in the IARP for APN rule is associated with an existing PDN connection, then the rule shall not be applied.\nWhen the UE has simultaneously an active IARP rule and an active ISRP rule, the UE evaluates first the rules for APN and for NSWO inside the active IARP rule (in priority order) to determine how to route an IP flow.\n-\tIf the IP flow matches a rule for NSWO inside the active IARP rule, then the IP flow is routed to an IP interface used for NSWO and the rules inside the active ISRP rule are not evaluated.\n-\tIf the IP flow matches a rule for APN inside the active IARP rule that prefers a certain APN, then the IP flow is routed to the IP interface corresponding to this APN. If IFOM procedures are applied on this IP interface, then the rules for IFOM inside the active ISRP rule are also evaluated and used to further route the flow. The rules for NSWO inside the active ISRP rule are not evaluated (thus the IP flow is not offloaded to WLAN if it also matches a rule for NSWO inside the active ISRP rule).\n-\tIf the IP flow matches a rule for APN inside the active IARP rule that forbids one or more APNs, then the UE evaluates the rules inside the active ISRP rule (in priority order) to determine how to route the IP flow. If the IP flow matches a rule for NSWO inside the active ISRP rule that forbids the use of the selected WLAN (or any WLAN) for routing the IP flow, then the UE may select, in an implementation dependent way, a non-forbidden APN to route the IP flow.\n-\tIf the IP flow does not match any rule inside the active IARP rule, then the UE evaluates the rules inside the active ISRP rule (in priority order) to determine how to route the IP flow.\nThe above order of rule evalution applies to both non-roaming and roaming scenarios and independently of whether the active IARP rule and the active ISRP rule are provided by the same or by different PLMNs.\nThe home operator may provide IARP rules to UE via the H-ANDSF or may pre-configure the UE with IARP rules. The IARP rules provided to UE via the H-ANDSF shall take precedence over the pre-configured IARP rules in the UE.\nThe WLAN Selection Policy (WLANSP) is a set of operator-defined rules that determine how the UE selects and reselects a WLAN access network. When not operating in SNPN access mode (as defined in TS 23.501 [87]) the UE may be provisioned with WLANSP rules from multiple PLMNs. The UE operating in SNPN access mode may be provisioned with WLANSP rules from the subscribed SNPN, Credential Holder or registered SNPN (as defined in TS 23.501 [87]).\nEach WLANSP rule includes the following information:\n-\tValidity conditions, i.e. conditions indicating when the provided rule is valid. The validity conditions can include the time of day, geolocation, network location (e.g. PLMN, Location Area), etc.\n-\tOne or more groups of WLAN selection criteria in priority order. Each group contains one or more criteria that should be fulfilled by a WLAN access network in order to be eligible for selection. Such criteria are based on the following and only the following WLAN attributes:\na)\tAttributes defined in the HS2.0 Rel-2 specification [75]:\n-\tPreferredRoamingPartnerList,\n-\tMinimumBackhaulThreshold,\n-\tMaximumBSSLoad,\n-\tRequiredProtoPortTuple.\n-\tA list of SSIDs as defined in the SPExclusionList.\nb)\tAdditional attributes:\n-\tPreferredSSIDList: A prioritized list of SSIDs preferred for selection.\n-\tHomeNetwork: When the HomeNetwork is set in a group of selection criteria, it indicates that the group of selection criteria applies only to WLAN access networks that directly interwork with the home operator. When the HomeNetwork is not set or is not present in a group of seletion criteria, it indicates that the group of selection criteria applies to all WLAN access networks. The UE determines which WLAN access networks directly interwork with the home operator as follows:\n-\tfor UE not operating in SNPN access mode by discovering which WLAN access networks advertise the HPLMN identity or the home network realm or a service provider realm equivalent to the HPLMN. The home network realm is derived by the UE from IMSI as specified in TS 23.003 [16] (e.g. wlan.mnc015.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org).\n-\tfor UE operating in SNPN access mode by discovering which WLAN access networks advertise the SNPN identity of the subscribed SNPN or the home network domain of the SNPN as defined in clause 28.2 of TS 23.003 [16].\nNOTE:\tIf the HomeNetwork is set in a group of selection criteria then this group of selection criteria is not expected to include the PreferredRoamingPartnerList and the PreferredSSIDList.\nFor example, a WLANSP rule may include the following groups of selection criteria:\n-\tGroup of selection criteria with priority 1:\n-\tPreferredRoamingPartnerList = Priority 1: partner1.com, Priority 2: partner2.com\n-\tMaximumBSSLoad = 60\n-\tGroup of selection criteria with priority 2:\n-\tPreferredSSIDList = Priority 1: myoperator1, Priority 2: myoperator2\n-\tMinimumBackhaulThreshold = 2Mbps in the downlink\nA WLAN access network meets a group of selection criteria when it concurrently fulfills all the criteria in the group.\nThe home operator may provide WLANSP rules to UE via the H-ANDSF or may pre-configure the UE with WLANSP rules. The WLANSP rules provided to UE via the H-ANDSF shall take precedence over the pre-configured WLANSP rules in the UE.\nThe \"VPLMNs with preferred WLAN Selection\" Rules is a list of PLMNs that is used by the UE when roaming. When the UE is roaming to one of the PLMNs in the list, the UE is configured to prefer the WLANSP rules provided by this PLMN over the WLANSP rules provided by the HPLMN. When the UE is roaming to any other PLMN, the UE is configured to prefer the WLANSP rules provided by the HPLMN.\nHow the UE uses this list of PLMNs for WLAN selection is specified in more detail in clause 4.8.2a.1.\nThe home operator may provide \"VPLMNs with preferred WLAN Selection\" rules to UE via the H-ANDSF or may pre-configure the UE with \"VPLMNs with preferred WLAN Selection\" rules. The \"VPLMNs with preferred WLAN Selection\" rules provided to UE via the H-ANDSF shall take precedence over the pre-configured \"VPLMNs with preferred WLAN Selection\" rules in the UE.\n\nThe Home Network Preferences may be provided by the UE's home operator and include information that assists the UE to select a WLAN access network and to select a PLMN for 3GPP-based authentication over WLAN. The Home Network Preferences may be provided by the HPLMN or an equivalent HPLMN or may be statically provisioned in the UE. The UE shall ignore the Home Network Preferences if provided by any other PLMN.\nThe Home Network Preferences may contain the following information:\n-\tEquivalent Home Service Providers (EHSP): Contains a list of service providers which are equivalent to the UE's HPLMN. Each service provider in EHSP is identified with a domain name, which may contain a PLMN identity (e.g. wlan.mncXYZ.mccABC.3gppnetwork.org) or may not contain a PLMN identity (e.g. example.com). The EHSP is used by the UE for PLMN selection over WLAN as specified in clause 4.8.2b.\n-\tPreferred Service Provider List (PSPL): Contains a prioritized list of service providers which are preferred for WLAN roaming. Each service provider in PSPL is identified with a domain name, which may contain a PLMN identity (e.g. wlan.mncXYZ.mccABC.3gppnetwork.org) or may not contain a PLMN identity (e.g. example.com). The UE uses the PSPL for WLAN selection and PLMN selection as specified in clause 4.8.2b.\n-\t\"S2a connectivity preference\": The \"S2a connectivity preference\" indicates if the home operator prefers the UE to establish PDN connections over WLAN by using the applicable S2a procedures specified in clause 16. It is used by the UE during the WLAN selection procedure as specified in clause 4.8.2b.\n-\t\"Prefer 3GPP RPLMN\" indication: This indication specifies how a roaming UE selects a PLMN in order to perform 3GPP-based authentication over WLAN access. If the \"prefer 3GPP RPLMN\" indication is not set, the UE attempts to select the HPLMN, or a service provider included in EHSP, or a service provider included in PSPL for authentication over WLAN access. If the \"prefer 3GPP RPLMN\" indication is set, the UE attempts to select the Registered PLMN (RPLMN) or a service provider included in EVSP of the RPLMN (see clause 4.8.2.1.10) for authentication over WLAN access. Further details about the use of \"prefer 3GPP RPLMN\" indication are provided in clause 4.8.2b.\nThe home operator may provide Home Network Preferences to UE via the H-ANDSF or may pre-configure the UE with Home Network Preferences. The Home Network Preferences provided to UE via the H-ANDSF shall take precedence over the pre-configured Home Network Preferences in the UE.\nThe Visited Network Preferences may be provided by a PLMN-x, which is different from the UE's HPLMN and all equivalent HPLMNs. They include information that assists the UE (when roaming to PLMN-x) to select a PLMN for authentication over WLAN. The UE shall ignore the Visited Network Preferences if provided by HPLMN or any equivalent HPLMN.\nThe Visited Network Preferences may contain the following information:\n-\tEquivalent Visited Service Providers (EVSP): Contains a list of service providers which are considered equivalent to the PLMN which provided the EVSP. Each service provider in EVSP is identified with a domain name, which may contain a PLMN identity (e.g. wlan.mncXYZ.mccABC.3gppnetwork.org) or may not contain a PLMN identity (e.g. example.com). The EVSP is used by the UE for PLMN selection over WLAN as specified in clause 4.8.2b.\nNOTE:\tThe list of Equivalent Visited Service Providers (EVSP) provided to UE by ANDSF is independent from the list of equivalent PLMNs (see TS 23.401 [4]) provided to UE via 3GPP access.\n",

For example, the highest priority valid WLANSP rule is selected as the active WLANSP rule.\nWhen the UE is roaming, it may have valid rules from both HPLMN and VPLMN. In this case, the UE shall select the active rules as follows:\n1)\tThe active IARP rule is selected from the valid IARP rules provided by the HPLMN.\n2)\tThe active ISMP/ISRP rule and the active WLANSP rule are selected based on the UE configuration as follows:\na)\tThe UE is configured to \"prefer WLAN selection rules provided by the HPLMN\" or not.

Thus during power-up the UE can select a WLAN network based on the WLANSP rules provided by HPLMN.\nThis clause specifies the UE behavior when it is provisioned with ANDSF information and has selected the active rules as described in the previous clause.\nIf the UE has received or has been provisioned with ANDSF information which indicates that there is an access network in its vicinity with higher priority than the currently selected access network(s), the UE should perform procedures for discovering and reselecting the higher priority access network, if this is allowed by user preferences.\nNOTE 1:\tHow frequently the UE performs the discovery and reselection procedure depends on the UE implementation.\n(i)\tWhen the UE cannot simultaneously route IP traffic over multiple radio accesses:\n-\tThe UE shall select the most preferable available access network for EPC connectivity and inter-system mobility based on the active ISMP rule, the active WLANSP rule and the user preferences. The user preferences take precedence over the active rules.\n-\tThe UE shall not consider any ISRP rules it may have received from the ANDSF.\n-\tWhen automatic access network selection is used, the UE shall not initiate a connection to EPC using an access network indicated as restricted in the active ISMP rule.\n-\tWhen the UE selects a non-3GPP radio access based on the active ISMP and the active WLANSP rules, the UE may still use 3GPP access for CS services.\nNOTE 2:\tThe user may manually select the access technology type or access network that should be used by the UE; in such case the active ISMP and the active WLANSP rules are not taken into account.\n-\tWhen the UE is connected to EPC over 3GPP access, the UE shall use the active IARP rule and the user preferences to determine if an IP flow should be routed inside a specific PDN connection.\n-\tWhen the UE is connected to EPC over WLAN access, the UE shall use the active IARP rule and the user preferences to determine if an IP flow should be routed inside a specific PDN connection or if it should be non-seamlessly offloaded to the selected WLAN access network.\n-\tThe UE shall use the active ISMP rule to determine if EPC connectivity is preferred over WLAN access or over 3GPP access. The prioritized list of access networks in the active ISMP rule shall not be used for WLAN selection since WLAN selection is based on the active WLANSP rule and the user preferences.\n-\tWhen EPC connectivity is preferred over WLAN access (i.e. the highest priority access in the active ISMP rule corresponds to WLAN access technology / network), the UE shall use the active WLANSP rule to determine the most preferred available WLAN access network (as specified in clause 4.8.2b).\n-\tWhen the UE is connected to EPC over WLAN access, the UE should occasionally re-evaluate if the connected WLAN still meets the selection criteria in the active WLANSP rule. The rate of this re-evaluation is defined by the UE implementation.

Otherwise, the UE shall connect to EPC over 3GPP access. For example:\n-\tIf the prioritized access networks in the active ISMP rule are the following: WLAN-A priority 1, 3GPP priority 2, WLAN-B priority 3; then\n-\tSince the UE determines that one or more WLANs are preferred for EPC connectivity over 3GPP access, the UE uses the groups of selection criteria in the active WLANSP rule to determine the most preferred available WLAN access network (as specified in clause 4.8.2b).\n-\tIf the most preferred available WLAN access network has lower priority than 3GPP access according to the active ISMP rule (e.g. WLAN-B), then the UE shall connect to EPC over 3GPP access.\n-\tIf the most preferred available WLAN access network has higher priority than 3GPP access according to the active ISMP rule (e.g. WLAN-A), then the UE shall connect to EPC over the most preferred available WLAN access network.\nNOTE 3:\tIt is assumed that the active ISMP rule in the UE can always be used to determine the relative priority of the most preferred WLAN (selected based on the active WLANSP rule) over 3GPP access.\n(ii)\tWhen the UE can simultaneously route IP traffic over multiple radio accesses:\n-\tThe UE shall not consider any ISMP rules it may have received from the ANDSF.\n-\tThe UE shall use the active WLANSP rule and the user preferences to select and connect to the most preferred available WLAN access network, as specified in clause 4.8.2b. User preferences take precedence over the active WLANSP rule. After that, the UE is simultaneously connected to 3GPP access and to the selected (most preferred) WLAN access network.\n-\tAfter the UE selects and connects to a WLAN access network based on the active WLANSP rule (as specified in clause 4.8.2b), the UE should occasionally re-evaluate if the connected WLAN still meets the selection criteria in the active WLANSP rule. The rate of this re-evaluation is defined by the UE implementation. When the UE determines that the currently connected WLAN does not meet the selection criteria in the active WLASP rule for an implementation-specific duration, the UE should attempt to select another WLAN access network as specified in clause 4.8.2b.\n-\tThe prioritized lists of access networks in the active ISRP rule shall not be used for WLAN selection since WLAN selection is based on the active WLANSP rule and the user preferences.\n-\tThe UE shall use the active ISRP for MAPCON rules and the user preferences to determine if a PDN connection to a certain APN should be established over 3GPP access or over the selected WLAN access network.\n-\tWhen an ISRP for MAPCON rule is used for the PDN connection establishment, the UE shall determine if the selected WLAN access network has higher priority than 3GPP access and establishes the PDN connection accordingly. For example:\n-\tIf the list of prioritized access networks in the ISRP for MAPCON rule are the following: WLAN-A priority 1, 3GPP priority 2, WLAN-B priority 3; then\n-\tIf the UE has selected WLAN-B (or any WLAN network with lower priority than 3GPP access), it shall establish the PDN connection over 3GPP access.\n-\tIf the UE has selected WLAN-A (or any WLAN network with higher priority than 3GPP access), it shall establish the PDN connection over WLAN access.\n-\tThe UE shall use the active ISRP for IFOM rules, the active ISRP for NSWO rules, the active IARP rule and the user preferences to determine how to route outgoing IP flows. Specifically:\n-\tThe UE shall evaluate the above rules in priority order as specified in clause 4.8.2.1.5 (Inter-APN Routing Policy) and shall determine which rule to apply.\n-\tWhen the applied rule is an ISRP for IFOM rule, the UE determines that this flow is subject to IP flow mobility and selects an access network to route this flow based on the prioritized list of access networks in the ISRP for IFOM rule. For example:\n-\tIf the prioritized list of access networks in the ISRP for IFOM rule are the following: WLAN-A priority 1, 3GPP priority 2, WLAN-B priority 3; then\n-\tIf the UE has selected WLAN-B (or any WLAN network with lower priority than 3GPP access), it shall route the IP flow over 3GPP access.\n-\tIf the UE has selected WLAN-A (or any WLAN network with higher priority than 3GPP access), it shall route the IP flow over WLAN access.\n-\tWhen the applied rule is an ISRP for NSWO or an IARP for NSWO rule, the UE shall route this IP flow to the selected WLAN access network (outside any PDN connection) provided that the rule does not prohibit this IP flow over the selected WLAN access network.\n-\tWhen the applied rule is an IARP for APN rule, the UE shall route this IP flow inside the PDN connection specified by this rule.\nNOTE 4:\tIt is assumed that the active ISRP rule in the UE can always be used to determine the relative priority of the selected WLAN access network over 3GPP access.\n",

User preferences take precedence over the WLANSP policies.\nThe following text specifies how the UE determines the most preferred WLAN access network (and possibly connects to this network, as clarified in clause 4.8.2a.2), when a WLAN access network cannot be selected based on user preferences (e.g. when there are no user preferences or when there is no user-preferred WLAN access network available).\nIf the UE supports S2a connectivity (see clause 16), then:\n-\tThe UE shall be able to discover WLANs that support S2a connectivity. This discovery shall be performed by using ANQP procedures (as specified in the HS2.0 Rel-2 specification [75]) to retrieve the 3GPP Cellular Network information advertised by WLANs. The 3GPP Cellular Network information (see IEEE 802.11-2012 [64]) advertised by a WLAN indicates the PLMNs that interwork with the WLAN. In addition, the 3GPP Cellular Network information indicates the PLMNs to which the WLAN supports S2a connectivity.\n-\tThe UE shall be able to discover WLANs that support emergency services. This discovery shall be performed by using ANQP procedures (as specified in the HS2.0 Rel 2 specification [75]) to retrieve the 3GPP WLAN Support of Emergency Services information advertised by WLANs.\n-\tThe UE may decide to select a WLAN that supports S2a connectivity to HPLMN, RPLMN or both HPLMN and RPLMN. This decision is based on UE implementation specific mechanisms and the \"S2a connectivity preference\" provisioned in the UE by the home ANDSF. The \"S2a connectivity preference\" is either set or not set. The UE performs service provider selection after selecting a WLAN that has S2a connectivity with the UE's HPLMN, RPLMN or both HPLMN and RPLMN.\n-\tWhen the \"S2a connectivity preference\" is set, it indicates that the home operator prefers the UE to establish PDN connections over WLAN by using the applicable S2a procedures specified in clause 16. In this case, when the UE attempts to select a WLAN and determines that a PDN connection will be required over this WLAN, the UE shall attempt to select a WLAN that supports S2a connectivity unless other procedures are applicable for this PDN connection (e.g. S2b or S2c procedures).\nThe UE shall use the active WLANSP rule, the Home Network Preferences and, if roaming, the Visited Network Preferences to determine the most preferred available WLAN access network. The WLAN selection shall be performed with the following steps.\ni.\tStep 1: The UE constructs a prioritized list of the available WLANs by discovering the available WLANs and comparing their attributes / capabilities against the groups of selection criteria in the active WLANSP rule. If the UE requests emergency services, the prioritized list shall only contain available WLANs that support emergency services. When a group of selection criteria includes the HomeNetwork attribute and is set, then the UE (a) shall create a list of available WLANs that directly interwork with the home operator (as specified in clause 4.8.2.1.6) and (b) shall apply the group of selection criteria to all the WLANs in this list. Otherwise, when the HomeNetwork attribute is not set or is not present, the UE shall apply the group of selection criteria to all available WLANs. The UE may need to perform ANQP procedures (as specified in the HS2.0 Rel-2 specification [75]) or other procedures in order to discover the attributes / capabilities of the available WLANs. The WLAN(s) that match the group of selection criteria with the highest priority are considered as the most preferred WLANs, the WLAN(s) that match the group of selection criteria with the second highest priority are considered as the second most preferred WLANs, etc. For example, the UE may construct the following prioritized list:\n-\tWLAN-1 (most preferred)\n-\tWLAN-4, WLAN-2 (second most preferred)\n-\tWLAN-3 (third most preferred, supports S2a connectivity to PLMN-a and PLMN-b)\nii.\tStep 2: If the UE decides to select a WLAN that supports S2a connectivity to one or more PLMNs (as specified above), then from the prioritized list contructed in the previous step the UE shall select the highest priority WLAN that support S2a connectivity to these PLMNs (e.g. WLAN-3 in the example shown above). If the UE does not discover a WLAN that supports S2a connectivity, or the UE does not decide to select a WLAN that supports S2a connectivity, then from the prioritized list contructed in the previous step the UE shall select the most preferred WLAN without considering its capability to support S2a connectivity (e.g. WLAN-1 in the example shown above).\n-\tIf the UE cannot select a single WLAN in this step, i.e. when there are multiple WLANs that could be selected but all have the same priority, then the UE shall select one of these multiple WLANs as follows:\na)\tIf the UE is not roaming, or if the UE is roaming and the \"prefer 3GPP RPLMN\" indication is not set, then the UE shall select a WLAN in this order: (a) a WLAN that directly interworks with the HPLMN, (b) a WLAN that directly interworks with a service provider in EHSP, (c) a WLAN that directly interworks with the most preferred service provider in PSPL.\nb)\tIf the UE is roaming and the \"prefer 3GPP RPLMN\" indication is set, then the UE shall select a WLAN in this order: (a) a WLAN that directly interworks with the RPLMN, (b) a WLAN that directly interworks with a service provider in EVSP. Otherwise the UE shall behave as specified in bullet a) above.\niii.\tStep 3: After selecting a single WLAN access network (as specified in steps 1 and 2), if the UE needs to perform 3GPP-based access authentication, the UE shall construct the NAI as follows:\na)\tIf the UE is not roaming, or if the UE is roaming and the \"prefer 3GPP RPLMN\" indication is not set, then:\n-\tIf the UE has selected a WLAN that directly interworks with the HPLMN, then the UE shall use the root NAI.\n-\tIf the UE has selected a WLAN that directly interworks with a service provider in EHSP list (see clause 4.8.2.1.9), then the UE shall construct a decorated NAI that includes the realm of this service provider.\n-\tOtherwise, the UE shall determine the most preferred service provider that interworks with the selected WLAN based on PSPL and shall construct a decorated NAI that includes the realm of this service provider.\nb)\tIf the UE is roaming and the \"prefer 3GPP RPLMN\" indication is set, then:\n-\tIf the UE has selected a WLAN that directly interworks with the RPLMN, then the UE shall construct a decorated NAI that includes the realm of RPLMN.\n-\tIf the UE has selected a WLAN that directly interworks with a service provider in EVSP list provided by the RPLMN (see clause 4.8.2.1.10), then the UE shall construct a decorated NAI that includes the realm of this service provider and the realm of RPLMN.\n-\tOtherwise, the UE shall behave as specified in bullet a) above.\nNOTE 1:\tThe UE performs the WLAN selection based on the active WLANSP rule without taking into account real-time events associated with the active ISRP rule. As specified in clause 4.8.2a.2, the active ISRP rule is used only for routing decisions and does not impact the selection or reselection of the WLAN access network. For example, when a new IP flow in the UE matches an active ISRP rule in which the highest priority access network is a WLAN other than the selected WLAN, this event should not trigger WLAN re-selection. If the conditions for WLAN selection change every time a new application runs or when certain IP flows are detected, the WLAN selection in the UE will be complex and may lead to frequent WLAN re-selections that would negatively affect the user experience and the battery consumption.\nNOTE 2:\tEvents such as change of WLAN load information, change of UE location, change of time of day may lead to WLAN (re-)selection based on the WLANSP rule.\n",

This RAN Assistance Information includes the following thresholds and parameters:\n-\t3GPP access thresholds;\n-\tWLAN access thresholds; and\n-\tAn Offload Preference Indication (OPI) value.\nThe 3GPP access thresholds define low/high threshold values for some UTRA and/or E-UTRA radio parameters, such as low/high RSRP thresholds for E-UTRA, low/high CPICH Ec/No thresholds for UTRA, etc. The WLAN access thresholds define low/high threshold values for some WLAN access parameters, such as the low/high Beacon RSSI thresholds, the high/low UL/DL backhaul data rate thresholds and the low/high channel utilization thresholds. UL/DL backhaul data rate is defined in Hotspot 2.0 [75]. Channel utilization and Beacon RSSI are defined in IEEE 802.11-2012 [64]. How these thresholds are used in the ANDSF rules is specified in clause 4.8.6.2.\nThe OPI value provided by RAN is a bitmap (i.e. a one-dimensional bit array) that may be used by UEs in an E-UTRA or UTRA cell to determine when they should move certain traffic (e.g. certain IP flows) to WLAN access or to 3GPP access. The meaning of each bit in this bitmap is operator specific and is not defined in 3GPP specifications. How the OPI value is used in the ANDSF rules is specified in clause 4.8.6.2.\nThe thresholds and parameters provided to UE in a UTRA or E-UTRA cell may affect the validity of the ANDSF rules (as specified in clause 4.8.6.2) and thus make these rules subject to conditions set by the RAN in a given cell.\nThe user preferences on WLAN network selection and traffic routing shall take precedence over ANDSF rules and RAN rules.\nThe 3GPP access thresholds, the OPI value and some of the WLAN access thresholds included in the RAN Assistance Information may be utilized by the following ANDSF rules:\n-\tThe Inter-System Routing Policy (ISRP) rules specified in clause 4.8.2.1.4, i.e. ISRP rules for IFOM, ISRP rules for MAPCON and ISRP rules for NSWO; and\n-\tThe Inter-APN Routing Policy (IARP) rules specified in clause 4.8.2.1.5, i.e. IARP rules for APN and IARP rules for NSWO.\nIn this release of the specification the ANDSF rules may use the low/high Beacon RSSI thresholds, the low/high WLAN channel utilization thresholds and the low/high UL/DL WLAN backhaul data rate thresholds included in the RAN Assistance Information. These thresholds subsequently referred to as \"RAN provisioned WLAN access thresholds\".\nThe ANDSF rules may also utilize low/high Beacon RSSI thresholds, low/high WLAN channel utilization thresholds and low/high UL/DL WLAN backhaul data rate thresholds provided by the ANDSF. These thresholds are subsequently referred to as \"ANDSF provisioned WLAN access thresholds\".\nNOTE:\tThe use of 3GPP access thresholds in the IARP for APN rules can enable routing policies such as \"move certain traffic from a non-seamless WLAN connection to a given PDN connection over LTE access when the LTE radio strength and quality exceed the applicable thresholds provided by RAN\".\nAn IARP/ISRP rule may utilize the 3GPP access thresholds, the RAN provisioned WLAN access thresholds and the OPI value included in the RAN Assistance Information and ANDSF provisioned WLAN access thresholds. When the rule utilizes any of these access thresholds and/or the OPI value, it shall be constructed as follows:\n1.\tThe IARP/ISRP rule shall contain RAN validity conditions, which indicate when the rule is valid or invalid based on the RAN Assistance Information.\n2.\tThe RAN validity conditions may contain one or more threshold conditions and one OPI condition.\n3.\tEach threshold condition shall be associated either (i) with a 3GPP access threshold provided by RAN or (ii) with WLAN access threshold(s) provided by ANDSF, RAN, or both. A threshold condition shall be evaluated to true or false as specified in clause 4.8.6.3.\n4.\tThe OPI condition shall contain a provisioned OPI which is a bitmap assigned by ANDSF and is associated with the rule. The meaning of each bit in this bitmap is operator specific and is not defined in 3GPP specifications. The OPI condition shall be evaluated to true or false based on the provisioned OPI and the OPI value provided by RAN, as specified in clause 4.8.6.3.\n5.\tThe RAN validity conditions include an indicator which indicates if the rule may be valid either (a) when all threshold conditions are true or (b) when at least one threshold condition is true.\nWhen the UE cannot simultaneously route IP traffic to both 3GPP access and WLAN, then\n-\tWhen the UE has an IARP rule that contains RAN validity conditions, the UE shall evaluate the rule by ignoring all the RAN validity conditions that may be present, i.e. the UE shall consider these RAN validity conditions as true.\nWhen the UE can simultaneously route IP traffic to both 3GPP access and WLAN access, then:\n-\tWhen the UE has an IARP or ISRP rule that contains RAN validity conditions, the UE shall evaluate all included threshold conditions and the OPI condition, as specified below. The UE shall consider the RAN validity conditions as valid when the OPI condition is true and when either (a) all threshold conditions are true or (b) at least one threshold condition is true, according to the indicator described in bullet 5 of clause 4.8.6.2.\n-\tWhen a threshold condition is associated with a 3GPP access threshold, the UE shall evaluate the threshold condition by comparing the associated 3GPP access threshold provided by RAN with the corresponding measured value. For example, when a threshold condition is associated with the low RSRP threshold, the UE shall evaluate the condition to true when the measured RSRP value is smaller to the low RSRP threshold. If the associated 3GPP access threshold is not available in the UE (e.g. it is not provided by RAN), then the UE shall consider the threshold condition as false.\n-\tWhen a threshold condition is associated with only a RAN provisioned WLAN access threshold, the UE shall evaluate the threshold condition by comparing the associated RAN provisioned WLAN access threshold with the corresponding value received from the selected WLAN. For example, when a threshold condition is associated with the low channel utilization threshold, the UE shall evaluate the condition to true when the channel utilization of the selected WLAN is smaller to the low channel utilization threshold. If the associated RAN provisioned WLAN access threshold is not available in the UE (e.g. it is not provided by RAN), then the UE shall consider the threshold condition as false.\n-\tWhen a threshold condition is associated with only an ANDSF provisioned WLAN access threshold, the UE shall evaluate the threshold condition by comparing the ANDSF provisioned WLAN access threshold with the corresponding value received from the selected WLAN. For example, when a threshold condition is associated with a high DL/UL backhaul data rate threshold, the UE shall evaluate the condition to true when DL/UL backhaul data rate of the selected WLAN is higher than the high DL/UL backhaul data rate threshold.\n-\tWhen a threshold condition is associated with both a RAN provisioned WLAN access threshold and an ANDSF provisioned WLAN access threshold, then it indicates that the threshold condition shall be evaluated by using only the RAN provisioned WLAN access threshold, if available (i.e. if included in the RAN Assistance Information). If the RAN provisioned WLAN access threshold is not available, the ANDSF provisioned WLAN access threshold shall be used.\n-\tHow often the UE re-evaluates the threshold and the OPI conditions to determine when each condition is true or false depends on the UE implementation.\n-\tThe UE shall evaluate an OPI condition by performing a bitwise 'AND' operation between the OPI value provided by RAN and the provisioned OPI contained in the rule.

Additional dedicated S2b bearers may be established on S2b for the same PDN connection depending on operator policy. The PGW establishes dedicated S2b bearers on S2b for the same PDN connection based on PCC decisions as specified in TS 23.203 [19].\nThe ePDG releases the SWu instance when the default S2b bearer of the associated PDN connection is released.\nThe S2b bearer is realized by the following elements:\n-\tA GTP tunnel on S2b transports the packets of an S2b bearer between the ePDG and a PDN GW;\n-\tThe ePDG stores the mapping between uplink packet filters it receives from the PGW (e.g. in the Create Bearer Request message) and the corresponding S2b bearer;\n-\tThe PDN GW stores the mapping between downlink packet filters and an S2b bearer.\nIn support for the UE connectivity with the PDN:\n-\tA SWu instance (i.e. a IPSec tunnel) transports the packets of all S2b bearer(s) for the same PDN Connection between the UE and the ePDG.\nThe ePDG routes uplink packets to the different bearers based on the uplink packet filters in the TFTs assigned to the bearers in the PDN connection, in the same way as a UE does for uplink traffic under 3GPP access. If no match is found, the uplink data packet shall be sent via the bearer that does not have any uplink packet filter assigned.

The PGW establishes dedicated S2b bearers on S2b for the same PDN connection based on PCC decisions as specified in TS 23.203 [19].\nThe ePDG releases the SWu instance, including all IP Sec SAs associated with the SWu instance, where applicable, when the default S2b bearer of the associated PDN connection is released.\nThe S2b bearer is realized by the following elements:\n-\tA GTP tunnel on S2b transports the packets of an S2b bearer between the ePDG and a PDN GW;\n-\tThe ePDG stores the mapping between IPSec SA and the corresponding S2b bearer;\n-\tThe PDN GW stores the mapping between downlink packet filters and an S2b bearer.\nThe ePDG shall establish a SA per S2b bearer as per clause 7.10. The default EPC bearer maps to the initial SA. The ePDG shall maintain a 1 to 1 mapping between an S2b bearer and an IPsec SA.\nAdditionally, for these UEs, TFTs and bearer QoS information is conveyed from the ePDG to the UE in IKE v2 signalling associated with the corresponding SA at EPC bearer creation and EPC bearer modification. The bearer QoS information includes information regarding the QoS characteristics of the bearer (i.e. QCI, GBR and MBR).\nThe IKEv2 traffic selectors TSi and TSr, defined in [9], shall not be used to route packets to the IPSec SA.\nIn support for the UE connectivity with the PDN:\n-\tA SWu instance (i.e. an IKEv2 SA with one or more IPsec SA) transports the packets of all S2b bearer(s) for the same PDN Connection between the UE and the ePDG.\nThe PDN GW routes downlink packets to the different bearers based on the downlink packet filters in in the TFTs assigned to the S2b bearers in the PDN connection, in the same way as the PDN GW does on GTP-based S5/S8 bearers (see TS 23.401 [4] clause 4.7.2.2).\nThe ePDG routes uplink packets to the different bearers based on the incoming child SA and the corresponding S2b bearer.\nThe UE routes uplink packets to the SAs associated with the different S2b bearers based on the uplink packet filters in the TFTs assigned to the S2b bearers in the PDN connection, in the same way as a UE does for uplink traffic under 3GPP access. If no match is found, the uplink data packet shall be sent via the SA that does not have any uplink packet filter assigned. If all IPsec SAs have been assigned an uplink packet filter, the UE shall discard the uplink data packet.\nTo support QoS differentiation,\n-\tfor downlink packets, if the ePDG sets the DSCP, the ePDG shall use the QCI, and optionally the ARP, of the S2b bearer via which the downlink packet was received to derive the DSCP value for downlink packets. If the ePDG sets the DSCP field, it may also set it in the outer IP header of the ESP packet.\nNOTE 1:\tThe ePDG maintains the mapping of DSCP values used on S2b and the outer ESP tunnel to the UE.\nNOTE 2:\tBased on operator policy and/or regional/national regulations, the ePDG can apply a different DSCP value to the outer ESP tunnel packet than the DSCP value of the inner IP packet.\n-\tfor uplink packets, the UE shall either use the DSCP value that it received from the ePDG, or the QCI in dedicated bearer QoS information to set the DSCP value for uplink packets. The mapping of QoS class to DSCP could be configurable in the UE and as an example can use the recommended mappings specified in 3GPP (mapping between standardized QCIs and Release 99 QoS parameter value in TS 23.401 [4]), IEEE Std. 802.11-2012 [64], and the Wi-Fi WMM-multimedia certification profile [86]. The UE may also use information included in dedicated QoS information for local aspects of admission control (e.g. application traffic shaping), however this is out of scope for this document.\n",

UE Support for multiple overlapping IP address spaces is optional.\n-\tMultiple PDN connections for a given APN and UE can be supported with the restrictions that all PDN connections for a given APN and UE shall use the same access network and shall all be moved to a new access network during handovers.\n-\tIf an additional PDN connection to the same APN occurs, and an existing PDN connection to that APN exists, the same PDN GW shall be selected.\n-\tMultiple PDN connections to different APNs may use different access networks. The UE selects the access network where to route a specific PDN connection based on user preferences and operator's policies.\n-\tA UE that is capable of routing different simultaneously active PDN connections through different access networks can do so if the UE is authorized by subscription to access each of the involved PDNs and each of the involved access networks.\n-\tThe access networks the UE can stay simultaneously connected with shall include no more than one 3GPP access and one and only one non-3GPP access.\nNOTE:\tDuring the handover procedure the UE moves the PDN connections one-by-one, but the selective handover of the PDN connections to the same APN is not supported.\nOnce a specific IP mobility protocol is selected during initial attach for a specific non-3GPP access, it is not possible for the UE to use different mobility protocols for any of the PDNs that it obtains connectivity on the same non-3GPP access after initial attach.

Proxy Mobile IP version 6 is used on S5 or S8 interface. It is assumed that the MAG is collocated with the Serving GW for the PMIPv6 procedure between the Serving GW and the PDN GW.\nWhen only GTP-based S5 or S8 connections are established for roamers from a GTP network into a PMIPv6 network the procedure as described in TS 23.401 [4] applies.\nFigure 5.2-1 illustrates the initial attachment process in an E-UTRAN network using PMIP-based S5 or S8. The figure showcases the synchronization process between the eNB and the UE, with the eNB serving as the initial access point. The figure also depicts the handover process, where the UE can detach from the eNB and attach to another eNB if signal strength or quality degrades. The figure highlights the importance of synchronization and handover in maintaining seamless connectivity and efficient resource allocation in E-UTRAN networks.\nFigure 5.2-1: Initial E-UTRAN attach with PMIP-based S5 or S8\nThis procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.1-1), Roaming (Figure 4.2.1-2) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the Serving GW and the hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN GW and the hPCRF.\nThis procedure is also used to establish the first PDN connection over E-UTRAN with PMIP based S5 or S8 when the UE already has active PDN connections only over a non-3GPP access network and wishes to establish simultaneous PDN connections to different APNs over multiple accesses.\nThe optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the procedures in figure 5.2-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed.

The Serving GW provides in addition the UE Location Information IE and user CSG information, if available. The Serving GW also indicates its support for the extended TFT filter format.\nIn the case of Emergency Attach, if the IMSI provided by the MME to the S-GW in step before C.1 is marked as unauthenticated, the SGW provides this IMSI marked as unauthenticated to the PCRF in the GW Control Session Establishment. This IMSI marked as unauthenticated is provided by the PCRF to the PDN GW in step C.3. In this case, the IMEI is used as the UE Identity in the message to the PCRF.\nC.2)\tThe Serving GW sends a Proxy Binding Update (MN NAI, Lifetime, Access Technology Type, Handover Indicator, APN, GRE key for downlink traffic, UE Address Info Additional Parameters, Charging Characteristics) to the PDN GW in order to establish the new registration. The MN NAI identifies the UE for whom the message is being sent. The Lifetime field must be set to a nonzero value in the case of a registration. Access Technology Type is set to indicate 3GPP access to EPS. Handover Indication option is set to indicate attachment over a new interface as no Handover indication is received from the MME. The APN may be necessary to differentiate the intended PDN from the other PDNs supported by the same PDN GW. The Serving GW includes the EPS bearer identity of the default bearer received from the MME if multiple PDN connections to the same APN are supported. The optional Additional Parameters may contain information, for example, protocol configuration options. The UE Address Info IE is used to request an IPv6 prefix, IPv4 address, or both IPv4 address and IPv6 prefix. Based on PDN Type parameter received in the Create Session Request, Serving GW includes request for IPv4 Home Address (PDN Type set to IPv4), or IPv6 Home Network Prefix (PDN type set to IPv6) or both IPv4 home address and IPv6 HNP (PDN type set to IPv4v6) in the PBU as specified in PMIPv6 specification, RFC 5213 [8]). In the case of a subscribed IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix provided by the MME in the PDN Address Allocation IE, the UE Address Info IE is set to the subscribed IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix.\nIn case of Emergency Attach, if IMSI is not provided by MME to SGW or the IMSI provided is marked as unauthenticated, the S-GW creates MN NAI based on IMEI as specified in TS 23.003 [16].\nNOTE 1:\tAny time after Step C.1 is initiated, Step C.2 can be initiated by MAG.\nC.3)\tThe PDN GW initiates the IP CAN Session Establishment Procedure with the PCRF, as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The PDN GW provides information to the PCRF used to identify the session and associate Gateway Control Sessions established in step C.1 correctly. The PDN GW also provide the PCRF with the UE IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix newly assigned as a result of step C.2, which might lead the PCRF to update the QoS rules to include this IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix. The PCRF creates IP-CAN session related information and responds to the PDN GW with PCC rules UE Location Information IE, user CSG information, if received from the Serving GW, and event triggers.\nIn case of Emergency Attach, if MN NAI based on IMEI is received in the PBU message in step C.2, the PDN GW uses the IMEI as a UE Identity in the message to the PCRF.\nC.4)\tThe PDN GW responds with a PMIPv6 Binding Acknowledgement (MN NAI, Lifetime, UE Address Info, GRE key for uplink traffic, Charging ID, Additional Parameters) message to the Serving GW. The MN NAI is identical to the MN NAI sent in the Proxy Binding Update. The Lifetime indicates the duration the binding will remain valid. The PDN GW takes into account the request from Serving GW and the policies of operator when the PDN GW allocates the UE Address Info. The UE address info returns the newly assigned IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix assigned to the UE, if one was requested in the PMIPv6 Proxy Binding Update message. IP address allocation by the PDN-GW is as stated in clause 4.7.1. \"IP Address Allocation with PMIP-based S5/S8\". If the PDN GW sends the DHCPv4 Address Allocation Procedure Indication in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message, the UE IPv4 address assigned by the PDN GW is not provided as part of the default bearer activation procedures to the UE. In this case, the Serving GW does not forward the IPv4 address assigned by the PDN GW to the MME, but sets the PDN Address to 0.0.0.0 in the message to the MME. If a valid IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix received in the Proxy Binding Update message, the PDN GW validates the addresses and returns it the UE Address Info IE of the Proxy Binding Acknowledge message. If the corresponding Proxy Binding Update contains the EPS bearer identity, the PDN GW shall acknowledge if multiple PDN connections to the given APN are supported. The Charging ID is assigned for the PDN connection for charging correlation purposes. The optional Additional Parameter information element may contain other information, including for example Protocol Configuration Options.\nNOTE 2:\tIn case the QoS rules have changed, the PCRF updates the QoS rules at the S-GW by initiating the GW Control Session Modification Procedure, as specified in TS 23.203 [19].\nNOTE 3:\tQoS rules may lead to establishment of new dedicated bearers along with the default bearer.\nC.5)\tThe PCRF initiates the Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision Procedure specified in TS 23.203 [19] by sending a message with the QoS rules and Event Trigger information to the S-GW. The PCRF also indicates whether the extended TFT filter format is to be supported for the PDN connection.\nNOTE 4\tThe Serving GW learns from the PBA whether the PDN GW supports multiple PDN connections to the same APN or not.\nAfter steps C.1-C.5 the procedure continues as it is defined in clause 5.3.2 in TS 23.401 [4] with the exception that the steps in block D are not performed.\n",

The figure depicts the interaction between the UE, the network controller, and the resource allocation server. The UE requests resources, such as bandwidth and time slots, from the network controller, which then communicates with the resource allocation server to determine the availability and allocation of these resources. The process is depicted through a series of boxes and arrows, representing the flow of information and resource allocation between the different components of the network. The figure emphasizes the importance of efficient resource allocation in ensuring seamless communication and optimal performance in a telecommunication network.\nFigure 5.4.1-1: Dedicated Resource Allocation Procedure, UE in Active Mode\nThis procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.1-1), Roaming (Figure 4.2.1-2) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases.

The procedure allows the UE to request for connectivity to an additional PDN over E-UTRAN, including allocation of a default bearer, when the UE already has active PDN connections over E-UTRAN. This procedure is also used to request for connectivity to an additional PDN over E-UTRAN when the UE is simultaneously connected to E-UTRAN and a non-3GPP access, and the UE already has active PDN connections over both the accesses. In this procedure, the UE is assumed to be in active mode. Proxy Mobile IP is used on S5 or S8 interface. It is assumed that the MAG is collocated with the Serving GW for the PMIPv6 procedure between the Serving GW and the PDN GW.\nWhen only GTP-based S5 or S8 connections are established for roamers from a PMIP network into a GTP network the procedure as described in clause 5.10.2 of TS 23.401 [4] applies.\nWhen PMIP-based S5/S8 is used the EPS bearer identities of the default bearers are used to differentiate the PDN connections for a given APN, i.e. the MN-ID, the APN and the EPS bearer identity of the default EPS bearer identify the PDN connection. The Serving Gateway shall include the EPS bearer identity of the default EPS bearer if multiple PDN connections per APN are supported in the Proxy Binding Update messages. If the EPS bearer identity is included in a Proxy Binding Update, the PDN GW shall explicitly indicate the support of multiple PDN connections to a given APN. The MME is configured if the Serving GWs in its PLMN support multiple PDN connections to the same APN over PMIP based S5/S8. If the Serving GW does not support multiple PDN connections to the same APN and the UE requests a PDN connection for an APN for which the UE already has an active PDN connection, the MME shall reject the PDN connectivity request. If the PDN GW does not support multiple PDN connections for a given APN, and the Serving GW supports multiple PDN connections to the same APN and the UE requests a PDN connection for an APN for which the UE already has an active PDN connection, the Serving GW shall reject the PDN connectivity request.\nThe procedure is also used for the re-establishment of existing PDN connectivity after the UE performed the handover from non-3GPP accesses for the first PDN connection by the Attach procedure. The UE triggers the re-establishment of existing PDN connectivity after the handover by providing a Request Type indicating \"Handover\" as specified in TS 23.401 [4].\n\nFigure 5.6.1-1: UE requested PDN connectivity with PMIP-based S5 or S8\nThis procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.1-1), Roaming (Figure 4.2.1-2) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the Serving GW and the hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN GW and the hPCRF.\nThe optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the procedures in figure 5.6.1-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway.\nFor UE request additional PDN connectivity to PDNs when connected to 3GPP access network with PMIP-based S5 or S8, the IP address is not available after step A1, steps in (Alt A) are performed after step A.1, excluding steps in (Alt B). The step in (C) is performed only when the UE establishes additional PDN connectivity with a PDN it is not already connected to, excluding step (D).\nFor re-establishment of existing PDN connectivity after the UE performed the handover from non-3GPP accesses, the steps shown in (Alt A) and (Alt B) are mutually exclusive in this procedure, i.e. either steps A.2-A.4 are executed or steps B.1-B.3. In order to execute the alternative (Alt B), the IP address of the UE needs to be available after step A.1. The IP Address(es) of the UE is received in step A.1, if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. If multiple PDN connections to same APN are supported by the Serving GW, (Alt A) shall be used in this procedure.\nIn case the IP address(es) of the UE is available after step A.1, (Alt B) provides lower jitter for dual radio handovers. In case the IP address(es) of the UE is not available after step A.1, (Alt A) shall be used.\nFor re-establishment of existing PDN connectivity after the UE performed the handover from non-3GPP accesses, the following also applies:\n-\tIn step A.2/B.1 the Serving GW sets the Handover Indicator to indicate handoff between two different interfaces of the UE.\n-\tThe step in (D) and step B.2 are performed only when the UE re-establishes PDN connectivity after a handover. The steps in (D) correspond to the PCEF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure specified in TS 23.203 [19].\n-\tIn step A.4/B.3, the UE Address Info shall contain the IP address the UE obtained during PDN connectivity establishment for this PDN over the non-3GPP access. The PDN GW also includes the Charging ID for the PDN connection in the Proxy binding acknowledgement. For the case of additional PDN connectivity with a PDN, the PDN-GW generates a Charging Id for the PDN connection. For the case of re-establishment of existing PDN connectivity after the UE performed a handover from non-3GPP access, the PDN GW reuses the Charging Id previously assigned to the PDN connection if the source access is a PMIP-based access or to the Default Bearer if the source access is GTP-based.\nThe steps A.1-A.4 correspond to steps C.1-C.4 in Figure 5.2-1.\nThe steps B.1-B.3 correspond to steps A.2, A.3b, A.4 in Figure 5.6.1-1.\n",

For the case of S-GW initiated PDN disconnection, which corresponds to PDN GW initiated bearer deactivation procedure of clause 5.4.4.1 of TS 23.401 [4], the procedure starts from step A.1 and there are no steps corresponding to box (B) of figure 5.4.4.1-1 of TS 23.401 [4].\nThe default bearer and all the dedicated resource allocations associated with the PDN address are released in this procedure.\nFigure 5.6.2.2-1 illustrates the PDN Gateway (PGW) initiated PDN Disconnection Procedure for PMIP-based S5/S8, detailing the steps involved in disconnecting a user's Packet Data Network (PDN) connection. The figure outlines the process, starting with the PGW notifying the Service Gateway (SGW) of the disconnection request. The SGW then initiates the disconnection process, which includes releasing the PDN connection and notifying the user's device. The figure also shows the role of the PDN Control Plane (PDP) in managing the disconnection, ensuring a smooth transition for the user's data traffic. The visual representation aids in understanding the sequence of events and the inter-dependencies between different network components during a disconnection event.\nFigure 5.6.2.2-1: PDN GW initiated PDN Disconnection Procedure for PMIP-based S5/S8\nThis procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.1-1), Roaming (Figure 4.2.1-2) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the Serving GW and the hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN GW and the hPCRF.\nThe optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the procedures in figure 5.6.2.2-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway.\nA.1.\tThe PDN GW sends a Binding Revocation Indication (PDN address) message to the Serving GW.\nSteps between A and B are described in clause 5.4.4.1 of TS 23.401 [4], using the indication that all bearers belonging to the given PDN address shall be released.\nB.1.\tThe Serving GW initiates the Gateway Control Session Termination Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The S-GW provides the information to enable the PCRF to uniquely identify the IP-CAN session and indicates User Location Information and/or UE Time Zone Information to the PCRF as an Event Report if the corresponding event trigger is set. This results in the removal of the Gateway Control session in S-GW.\nB.2.\tThe Serving GW returns a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message to the PDN GW.\nNOTE:\tStep B.2 may occur before steps B.1 since the Serving GW need not wait for terminating the GW Control Session with the PCRF before acknowledging the Binding Revocation.\n",

The source Serving GW relinquishes its Gateway Control Session with the PCRF in step B.\nFigure 5.7.1-1 illustrates the intra-LTE and inter-eNodeB handover process with the serving GW relocation. The figure depicts the initial connection between the UE and the eNodeB, followed by the handover process when the UE moves to a new cell. The serving GW relocation is shown as the transfer of the UE's connection from one eNodeB to another, ensuring seamless connectivity. The figure highlights the role of the Mobility Management Entity (MME) and the Home Location Register (HLR) in managing the handover and maintaining the UE's identity.\nFigure 5.7.1-1: Intra-LTE and Inter-eNodeB Handover with Serving GW Relocation\nThis procedure concerns both the non-roaming (S5) as in Figure 4.2.1-1 and roaming case (S8) as in Figure 4.2.1-2. In the roaming case, the vPCRF in the VPLMN forwards messages between the Serving GW and the hPCRF in the HPLMN. In the case of Local Breakout as in Figure 4.2.3-4, the vPCRF also forwards messages sent between the PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at all.\nThe optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the procedures in Figure 5.7.1-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway.\nA.1)\tThe Target Serving GW initiates the Gateway Control Session Establishment Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. As part of the procedure the Serving GW informs the PCRF of the RAT type, UE Location Information IE and the user CSG information, if available. The PCRF sends information to the Serving GW enabling bearer binding and other behaviour. The Target Serving GW checks whether the QoS rules provided by the PCRF aligns with the TFT and Bearer Level QoS of the EPS bearer contexts. If there is a mismatch, the Target Serving GW initiates appropriate EPS bearer procedures.\nNOTE 1:\tThe Target Serving GW preserves the Bearer Binding that have already been established by the Source Serving GW. To enable this the EPS Bearer ID, TFT is transferred before Step A as follows: across S10 in Forward Relocation Request and across S11 in Create Session Request. The Event Triggers indicate to the Serving GW under what conditions to report events to the PCRF.\nNOTE 2:\tThe PCRF provides to the Target Serving GW the QoS rules which were active at the Source Serving GW before the handover. Any change of the QoS rules is performed via an additional QoS Rule Provision Procedure after the handover.\nA.2)\tThe PCRF may update the PCC rules at the PDN GW by initiating the PCC Rules Provision Procedure as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The PCRF also notifies the PDN GW of the UE Location Information IE and user CSG information (if this has been received from the Serving GW preceding step A.1).\nA.3)\tThe new Serving GW performs a PMIPv6 Proxy Binding Update (MN NAI, Lifetime, Access Technology Type option, APN, GRE key for downlink traffic, Additional Parameters) message in order to re-establish the user plane as a result of the Serving GW relocation. The MN NAI identifies the UE for whom the message is being sent. Within Access Technology Type option an indication for RAT (E-UTRAN) type is set; an indication for handover between MAGs for the same interface is also set. If multiple PDN connections for the given APN are supported by the Serving GW then the APN and the EPS bearer identity of the default bearer disambiguates which PDN connection this message refers to, otherwise the APN itself identifies the PDN connection of the UE. The additional parameters may include protocol configuration options and other information.\nA.4)\tThe PDN GW acknowledges the Binding Update by sending a Proxy Binding Ack (MN NAI, Lifetime, UE Address Info, GRE key for uplink traffic, Charging ID, Additional Parameters) message to the Serving GW. If the EPS bearer identity is included in the Proxy Binding Update, the PDN GW shall acknowledge if multiple PDN connections to the given APN are supported. A PMIP tunnel is established at this point between the PDN GW and the Serving GW. The UE Address Info includes one or more IP addresses. The Additional Parameters may contain protocol configuration options and other information. The Charging Id provided is the Charging Id previously assigned to the PDN connection.\nA.5)\tIf the Serving GW is relocated, the PDN GW shall send End Marker Indication message to the source SGW immediately after switching the path. If the source Serving GW has downlink user plane established, the source Serving GW shall send one or more \"end marker\" packets to the source eNodeB immediately after receiving this indication in order to assist the reordering function in the target eNodeB. Otherwise the souce Serving GW shall ignore the message and shall not send Downlink Data Notification.\nEditor's note:\tThe protocol detail of \"End Marker Indication\" is FFS and is to be studied in CT WG4.\nNOTE 3:\tThe Serving GW learns from the PBA whether the PDN GW supports multiple PDN connections to the same APN or not.\nSteps between A.4 and B.1 are described in TS 23.401 [4], clauses 5.3.3.1 and 5.5.1.\nB.1)\tThe old Serving GW initiates the Gateway Control Session Termination Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The Serving GW ceases to perform Bearer Binding and associated policy controlled functions.\nProcedures on the MME for X2 and S1 handover are described in clause 5.5 of TS 23.401 [4]. If the MME receives a rejection to an S1 interface procedure (e.g. EPS bearer(s) request) from the eNodeB with an indication that an X2/S1 handover is in progress and if during the handover procedure the MME detects that the Serving GW or/and the MME needs be relocated, the MME rejects any EPS bearer(s) request received since handover procedure started and includes an indication that the request has been temporarily rejected due to handover procedure in progress.\nFor PMIP based S5/S8, if dynamic PCC is deployed and with Serving GW relocation, when the Source Serving GW  receives an indication from the MME that the PCRF initiated dedicated bearer procedure was temporarily rejected due to handover, the Source Serving GW starts a locally configured guard timer. The Source Serving GW shall re-attempt, up to a pre-configured number of times, at expiry of the guard timer or abort the procedure if it determines that Serving GW is relocated based on receiving the Delete Session request message from the MME.\n",

The PMIP based S5/S8 variants procedure steps for inter-RAT TAU/RAU or handover without Serving GW relocation are shown in Figure 5.7.2-1 and those corresponding to a change of Serving GW are shown in Figure 5.7.2-2.\nThe procedures in this clause correspond to the following Figures in TS 23.401 [4]:\n-\tFigure 5.3.3.2-1 [UTRAN Iu mode to E-UTRAN] Tracking Area Update.\n-\tFigure 5.3.3.3-1E-UTRAN to UTRAN/GERAN RA Update.\n-\tFigure 5.3.3.6-1 E-UTRAN to GERAN A/Gb mode Routeing Area Update.\n-\tFigure 5.5.2.1.3-1: E-UTRAN to UTRAN Iu mode Inter RAT HO, execution phase.\n-\tFigure 5.5.2.2.3-1: UTRAN Iu mode to E-UTRAN Inter RAT HO, execution phase.\n-\tFigure 5.5.2.3.3-1: E-UTRAN to GERAN A/Gb mode Inter RAT HO, execution phase.\n-\tFigure 5.5.2.4.3-1: GERAN A/Gb mode to E-UTRAN Inter RAT HO, execution phase.\nIn TS 23.401 [4], the clauses corresponding to Figure 5.7.2-1 and Figure 5.7.2-2 cover both the case of Serving GW relocation and no Serving GW relocation. In case of no Serving GW relocation, Steps (A) in the above figures are between the un-changed Serving GW and the PCRF and the Steps (B) in those figures do not apply, as shown in Figure 5.7.2-1. In case of Serving GW relocation, Steps (A) in the above figure are between the target Serving GW and the PCRF and the Steps (B) is between the source Serving GW and the PCRF, as shown in Figure 5.7.2-2.\nIn case of no Serving GW relocation, the S-GW signals the change of RAT to the PCRF. In addition, if the Serving GW has received the User Location Information IE or the user CSG information from the MME, this information is also sent to the PCRF. If PCC rules provided to the PDN-GW have changed, the PCRF updates these rules at the PDN-GW. The PCRF sends the RAT Type change or User Location Information and user CSG information, if received from the Serving- GW, to the PDN GW.\nThe user plane already exists between the Serving GW and the PDN GW and remains unchanged. In case of RAU or handover to 2G/3G, user plane routing is assumed to proceed over the S4 interface towards the S2/S3 SGSN. When an inter-RAT TAU occurs, the enhanced packet core may signal this event to the PDN GW, for example to inform the PDN GW of a RAT type change. In the case of a PMIP-based S5 and S8, a Modify Bearer Request is not sent from the Serving GW to the PDN GW. Instead, the PCRF in the HPLMN reports the change of event. The PCRF signals any change in the policy resulting from the event to the PDN GW, provisioning updated policy and charging rules.\nIn case dynamic PCC is not deployed, a change of RAT type will not be signalled to the PDN GW using PMIP based S5/S8 interfaces, if no change of Serving GW has occurred.\nFigure 5.7.2-1 illustrates the inter-RAT TAU/RAU or handover process without the relocation of the Serving GW. The figure depicts the seamless transition of a mobile user from one Radio Access Technology (RAT) to another, ensuring uninterrupted service. The diagram showcases the involvement of the Serving GW, Mobility Management Entity (MME), and Home Location Register (HLR) in this process. The visual representation emphasizes the importance of efficient handover mechanisms in maintaining network quality and user experience.\nFigure 5.7.2-1: Inter-RAT TAU/RAU or Handover without Serving GW relocation\nThis procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.1-1), Roaming (Figure 4.2.1-2) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the Serving GW and the hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN GW and the hPCRF.\nThe optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the procedures in Figure 5.7.2-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway.\nA.1)\tThe Serving GW informs the PCRF about the change of RAT type and UE Location Information IE and user CSG information (if this has been received from the MME preceding step A) by initiating the Gateway Control and QoS Policy Rules Request Procedure as specified in TS 23.203 [19].\nA.2)\tThe PCRF updates the PCC rules at the PDN GW by initiating the PCC Rules Provision Procedure as specified in TS 23.203 [19] if the PCC rules have changed based on the RAT type reported by the Serving GW in step A.1. Further, the hPCRF notifies the PDN GW of the change in RAT and the UE Location Information IE and user CSG information (if this has been received from the Serving GW preceding step A.1).\nStep A.2 may be initiated before A.1 completes.\nIf dynamic PCC is deployed and during the handover with MME relocation without serving GW relocation, when the Serving GW receives an indication from the MME that the PCRF initiated dedicated bearer procedure was temporarily rejected due to handover, the Serving GW starts a locally configured guard timer. The Serving GW shall re-attempt, up to a pre-configured number of times, when it either detects that the handover is completed or failed using message reception or at expiry of the guard timer.\nThe following procedure describes inter-RAT TAU/RAU or Handover in the case of Serving Gateway relocation for PMIP-based S5/S8.\nFigure 5.7.2-2 illustrates the inter-RAT TAU/RAU or handover process with the serving GW relocation in a telecommunication network. The figure depicts the various components involved, including the RATs (Radio Access Technologies), the Serving GW (Gateway), and the TAU/RAU (Traffic and User Association). The diagram showcases the seamless transition of user association and traffic routing during a handover, ensuring minimal disruption to the user experience. The figure also highlights the role of the Serving GW in managing the handover process and maintaining network connectivity.\nFigure 5.7.2-2: Inter-RAT TAU/RAU or Handover with Serving GW Relocation\nThis procedure concerns both the non-roaming (S5) as in Figure 4.2.1-1 and roaming case (S8) as in Figure 4.2.1-2.

The UE Location Information IE and user CSG information are also sent to the PDN GW from the PCRF (if this has been received from the Serving GW preceding step A.1).\nA.3)\tThe Target Serving GW sends a Proxy Binding Update (MN NAI, Lifetime, Access Technology Type, APN, GRE key for downlink traffic, Additional Parameters) message in order to re-establish the user plane as a result of the Serving GW relocation.

The procedure is used to delete the IPv4 address from the PDN connection context.\nFigure 5.11-1 illustrates the process of initiating the IPv4 address delete procedure at the PDN Gateway (PGW). The figure depicts the various steps involved, starting with the source device sending a delete request to the PGW. The PGW then forwards the request to the Network Address Translation (NAT) server, which checks the address pool and verifies the delete request. If the request is valid, the NAT server removes the address from its pool and sends a confirmation back to the PGW. The PGW then notifies the source device of the successful address deletion.

In both roaming and non-roaming cases, S2a is present. It is assumed that MAG exists in the trusted non-3GPP IP access.\nFigure 6.2.1-1 illustrates the initial attachment process with Network-based Mobility Management (NMM) mechanism over S2a for both roaming and non-roaming scenarios. The figure depicts the attachment process in three distinct scenarios: initial attachment with Network-based MM mechanism over S2a for roaming, initial attachment with Network-based MM mechanism over S2a for non-roaming, and initial attachment with Network-based MM mechanism over S2a for LBO. The figure highlights the key components involved in the attachment process, including the mobile device, the home network, the network-based MM mechanism, and the service-based architecture. The figure also shows the different stages of the attachment process, from the initial connection to the final establishment of the connection. The figure is a valuable resource for understanding the complex process of initial attachment in mobile networks.\nFigure 6.2.1-1: Initial attachment with Network-based MM mechanism over S2a for roaming, LBO and non-roaming scenarios\nThe optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured in the gateway.\nThis procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1), Roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the non-3GPP access and the hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the Roaming and LBO cases, the 3GPP AAA Proxy serves as an intermediary between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA Server in the HPLMN. In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at all.\nThis procedure is also used to establish the first PDN connection over a trusted non-3GPP access with S2a when the UE already has active PDN connections only over a 3GPP access and wishes to establish simultaneous PDN connections to different APNs over multiple accesses.\n1)\tThe initial Non-3GPP access specific L2 procedures are performed. These procedures are Non-3GPP access specific and are outside the scope of 3GPP.\n2)\tThe EAP authentication procedure is initiated and performed involving the UE, Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA Server. In the roaming case, there may be several AAA proxies involved. Subscription data is provided to the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access by the HSS/AAA in this step. The list of all the authorized APNs along with additional PDN GW selection information is returned to the access gateway as part of the reply from the 3GPP AAA Server to the trusted non-3GPP access as described in clause 4.5.1. The 3GPP AAA Server also returns to the trusted non-3GPP access the MN NAI to be used to identify the UE in Proxy Binding Update and Gateway Control Session Establishment messages (steps 4 and 10). If supported by Non-3GPP access network, the Attach Type is indicated to the Non-3GPP access network by the UE. The mechanism for supporting attach type is access technology specific and out of scope for 3GPP standardization. Attach Type indicates \"Handover\" when the UE already has active PDN connection(s) due to mobility from 3GPP access to non-3GPP access.\nNOTE 1:\tThe MN NAI returned from the 3GPP AAA Server to the trusted non-3GPP access is a permanent IMSI based MN NAI.\n3)\tAfter successful authentication and authorization, the non-3GPP access specific L3 attach procedure is triggered. The UE may send requested APN to the Non-3GPP IP access in this step.\nIf the UE sends a requested APN in this step, the Trusted non-3GPP Access verifies that it is allowed by subscription. If the UE does not send a requested APN the Trusted non-3GPP Access uses the default APN.\nThe PDN Gateway selection takes place at this point as described in clause 4.5.1. This may entail an additional interaction with the Domain Name Server function in order to obtain the PDN GW address. If the PDN subscription profile returned by the 3GPP AAA Server in step 2 contains a PDN GW identity for the selected APN and the Attach Type does not indicate \"Handover\", the Non-3GPP access GW may request a new PDN GW as described in clause 4.5.1, e.g. to allocate a PDN GW that allows for more efficient routeing.\nThe UE may request the type of address (IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix or both) during this step.\nIf supported by the non-3GPP access, the UE may send Protocol Configuration Options in this step using access specific mechanisms. The Protocol Configuration Options provided by the UE may include the user credentials for PDN access authorization. In that case, in order to handle situations where the UE may have subscriptions to multiple PDNs, the UE should also send a requested APN to the non-3GPP IP access.\n4)\tThe Trusted non-3GPP access initiates the Gateway Control Session Establishment Procedure with the PCRF, as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The Trusted non-3GPP access provides the information to the PCRF to correctly associate it with the IP-CAN session to be established in step 6 and also to convey subscription related parameters to the PCRF, including the APN-AMBR (if forwarded by the trusted non-3GPP IP access) and Default Bearer QoS.\n5)\tThe MAG function of Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access sends a Proxy Binding Update (MN-NAI, Lifetime, Access Technology Type, Handover Indicator, APN, GRE key for downlink traffic, Charging Characteristics, Additional Parameters) message to PDN GW. The MN NAI identifies the UE. The Lifetime field must be set to a nonzero value. Access Technology Type is set to a value matching the characteristics of the non-3GPP access. The MAG creates and includes a PDN connection identity if the MAG supports multiple PDN connections to a single APN. Handover Indicator is set to indicate attachment over a new interface as the UE has provided Attach Type indicating \"Initial\" attach. The Additional Parameters include the Protocol Configuration Options provided by the UE in step 3 and may also include other information. The MAG requests the IP address types (IPv4 address and/or IPv6 Home Network Prefix) based on requested IP address types and subscription profile in the same way as the PDN type is selected during the E-UTRAN Initial Attach in TS 23.401 [4]. If the PDN requires an additional authentication and authorization with an external AAA Server, the PDN GW performs such an additional authentication and authorization at the reception of the Proxy Binding Update.\nNOTE 2:\tAny time after initiation of Step 4, Step 5 can be initiated by MAG.\n6)\tThe PDN GW initiates the IP-CAN Session Establishment Procedure with the PCRF, as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The PDN GW provides information to the PCRF used to identify the session and associate Gateway Control Sessions established in step 4 correctly. The PCRF creates IP-CAN session related information and responds to the PDN GW with PCC rules and event triggers. If available, the PCRF may modify the APN-AMBR and provides the APN-AMBR and Default Bearer QoS to the PDN GW in the response message.\n7)\tThe selected PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of its PDN GW identity and the APN corresponding to the UE's PDN Connection. The message includes information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located. This information is registered in the HSS as described in clause 12. The PDN GW shall only use the APN-AMBR and Default Bearer QoS received from the 3GPP AAA server in this step if these parameters have not been received in step 6.\n8)\tThe PDN GW processes the proxy binding update and creates a binding cache entry for the UE. The PDN GW allocates IP address(es) for the UE. The PDN GW then sends a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (MN NAI, Lifetime, UE Address Info, GRE key for uplink traffic, charging ID, Additional Parameters) message to the MAG function in Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access, including the IP address(es) allocated for the UE. The UE Address Info includes one or more IP addresses. The Lifetime indicates the duration of the binding. If the corresponding Proxy Binding Update contains the PDN connection identity, the PDN GW shall acknowledge if multiple PDN connections to the given APN are supported. The Charging ID is assigned for the PDN connection for charging correlation purposes. The Additional Parameters may include Protocol Configuration Options and other information.\nNOTE 3:\tIf UE requests for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, both are allocated. If the PDN GW operator dictates the use of IPv4 addressing only or IPv6 addressing only for this APN, the PDN GW shall allocate only IPv4 address or only IPv6 prefix to the UE. If the UE requests for only IPv4 or IPv6 address only one address is allocated accordingly.\nNOTE 4:\tThe MAG learns from the PBA whether the PDN GW supports multiple PDN connections to the same APN or not.\n9)\tThe PMIPv6 tunnel is set up between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the PDN GW.\n10)\tThe PCRF may update the QoS rules in the trusted non-3GPP access by initiating the GW Control Session Modification Procedure, as specified in TS 23.203 [19].\n11)\tL3 attach procedure is completed via non-3GPP access specific trigger. IP connectivity between the UE and the PDN GW is set for uplink and downlink directions. At this step the IP address information is provided to the UE. Unless already known from step 3, the Non-3GPP IP access should indicate the connected PDN identity (APN) to the UE. If supported by the non-3GPP access, the Protocol Configuration Options provided by the PDN GW in step 8 are returned to the UE in this step using access specific mechanisms.\n",

The figure depicts the mechanism by which a mobile node (MN) establishes a new association with a home agent (HA) using the Mobile IPv4 Fast Attach Command (FACoA) mode. The figure shows the MN sending a request to the HA, which then responds with a Home Agent Binding Identifier (HABI) and a Binding Identifier (BID). The MN uses these identifiers to create a new association with the HA, allowing it to maintain connectivity even when it is not in the same location as its home agent.

The UE may not indicate a specific Home Agent address in the RRQ message, in which case the PDN Gateway/Home Agent is selected by the FA as per step 2. The UE then receives the IP address of the PDN Gateway in step 13 as part of the Registration Reply (RRP) message. The UE should then include the PDN Gateway address in the Home Agent address field of subsequent RRQ messages. Subscription data is provided to the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access by the HSS/AAA in this step. The UE may request connectivity to a specific PDN by using an APN as specified in RFC 5446 [39]. If the UE provides an APN the FA verifies that it is allowed by subscription. If the UE does not provide an APN the FA establishes connectivity with the default PDN.

Then the MAG function performs the PDN GW selection. If PCC is deployed, the MAG function of the Trusted Non-3GPP IP access is notified to interact with the PCRF when it is PMIP-based chained case.\n2)\tThe MAG function of Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access or ePDG sends a Proxy Binding Update (MN-NAI, Lifetime, Access Technology Type, Handover Indicator, APN, GRE key for downlink traffic, PDN GW address, Additional Parameters) message to the Serving GW in the VPLMN. The MN NAI identifies the UE. The Lifetime field must be set to a nonzero value, indicating registration. Access Technology Type is set to a value matching the characteristics of the non-3GPP access. The MAG creates and includes a PDN connection identity if the MAG supports multiple PDN connections to a single APN. Handover Indicator is set to indicate attachment over a new interface. The MAG requests the IP address types (IPv4 address and/or IPv6 Home Network Prefix) based on requested IP address types and subscription profile in the same way as the PDN type is selected during the E-UTRAN Initial Attach in TS 23.401 [4]. The Additional Parameters may include Protocol Configuration Options and other information.\n3)\tThe Serving GW sends a corresponding Proxy Binding Update (MN-NAI, Lifetime, Access Technology Type, Handover Indicator, APN, GRE key for downlink traffic, Additional Parameters) message (as in step 2) to the PDN GW. The GRE key for downlink traffic is allocated by the Serving GW. If the MAG included the PDN connection identity in the Proxy Binding Update of the previous step and the Serving GW supports multiple PDN connections to a single APN then the Serving GW forwards the PDN connection identity to the PDN GW.\nNOTE 1:\tIn this Release of the specification, the Serving GW uses the right protocol to connect with the PDN GW based on the pre-configured information on itself in case the selected Serving GW supporting both PMIP and GTP.\n4)\tThe PDN GW initiates the PCEF-initiated IP CAN Session Establishment Procedure with the hPCRF, as specified in TS 23.203 [19].\n5)\tThe selected PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN GW identity. The message includes information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located. The 3GPP AAA Server then conveys this information to the HSS for the UE.\n6)\tThe PDN GW processes the proxy binding update and allocates IP address(es) for the UE. The PDN GW creates a binding cache entry for the PMIPv6 tunnel towards the Serving GW and sends a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (MN NAI, Lifetime, UE Address Info, GRE key for uplink traffic, Charging ID, Additional Parameters) message to the Serving GW. The MN NAI is identical to the MN NAI sent in the Proxy Binding Update. The Lifetime indicates the duration the binding will remain valid. The UE Address Info includes one or more IP addresses. If the corresponding Proxy Binding Update contains the PDN connection identity, the PDN GW shall acknowledge if multiple PDN connections to the given APN are supported. The Charging ID is assigned for the PDN connection for charging correlation purposes. The Additional Parameters may include Protocol Configuration Options and other information.\nNOTE 2:\tIf UE requests for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, both are allocated. If the UE requests for only IPv4 or IPv6 address only one address is allocated accordingly.\nNOTE 3:\tThe MAG learns from the PBA whether the PDN GW supports multiple PDN connection to the same APN or not.\n7)\tThe Serving GW processes the proxy binding acknowledgement and creates a binding cache entry for the PMIPv6 tunnel towards the MAG function in the trusted non-3GPP access or ePDG. At this point, the Serving GW also establishes the internal forwarding state for the concatenation of the PMIPv6 tunnels. The Serving GW then sends a corresponding Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (MN NAI, Lifetime, UE Address Info, GRE key for uplink traffic, Charging ID, Additional Parameters) message (as in step 7) to the MAG function of Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access or ePDG. The GRE key for uplink traffic is allocated by the Serving GW. The Charging ID is assigned for the PDN connection for charging correlation purposes.\n8)\tThe attach procedure is completed as described in steps 10-11 of clause 6.2.1 (for trusted non-3GPP access) and steps 6-8 of clause 7.2.1 (for untrusted non-3GPP access).\n",

                    "text_content": "This clause is related to the case when the UE attaches to a Trusted Non-3GPP Access network and host based mobility management mechanisms are used. Dual Stack MIPv6, RFC 5555 [10] is used for supporting mobility over S2c interface.\nThe S2c initial attach can be seen to consist of several modules:\nA.\tThe UE sets up local IP connectivity in a Trusted Non-3GPP Access\nB.\tThe UE discovers the HA, and establishes a security association with it to protect DSMIPv6 signalling.\nC.\tThe UE performs a Binding Update with the PDN GW\nFigure 6.3-1 illustrates the initial attachment process in a network using Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access with DSMIPv6. The figure depicts the connection setup between a user equipment (UE) and a network element, highlighting the use of DSMIPv6 for secure and efficient communication. The diagram showcases the interaction between the UE and the network, emphasizing the importance of this process in establishing a reliable and secure connection.\nFigure 6.3-1: Initial attachment from Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access with DSMIPv6\nNon-roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1), home routed roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases are supported by this procedure. The AAA proxy and vPCRF are only used in the case of home routed roaming and Local Breakout. In non-roaming scenarios, the AAA proxy and vPCRF are not involved.\nThis procedure is also used to establish the first PDN connection over a trusted non-3GPP access with DSMIPv6 on S2c when the UE already has active PDN connections only over a 3GPP access and wishes to establish simultaneous PDN connections to different APNs over multiple accesses.\nThe optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured in the gateway.\nThe UE may be authenticated and authorised to access the Trusted Non-3GPP Access network according to an access network specific procedure. These procedures are outside the scope of 3GPP, After the authentication, UE is configured with Local IP Address from the access network domain.\nA)\tSetup of Local IP connectivity\n1)\tAccess Authentication procedure for trusted Non-3GPP access networks between UE and the 3GPP EPC shall be performed as defined by TS 33.402 [45] unless the conditions in TS 33.402 [45] are met that allow to skip this procedure. As indicated above, in the roaming case signalling may be routed via a 3GPP AAA Proxy in the VPLMN. As part of the AAA exchange for network access authentication, the AAA/HSS and/or the 3GPP AAA Proxy may return to the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access a set of home/visited operator's policies to be enforced on the usage of local IP address, or IPv6 prefix, allocated by the access system upon successful authentication. Subscription data is provided to the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access by the HSS/AAA in this step.\n2)\tThe L3 connection is established between the UE and the Trusted Non-3GPP Access system. As a result of this procedure, an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address/prefix is also assigned to the UE by the access system (i.e. a Local IP address that will be used as a Care-of Address for DSMIPv6 over the S2c reference point).\nNOTE 1:\tIt is assumed that the access system is aware that network-based mobility procedures do not need to be initiated.\nNOTE 2:\tThe access system may complete the step 2 after step 3.\n3)\tIf the access system supports PCC-based policy control, the access gateway initiates a Gateway Control Session Establishment Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The message includes at least the UE IP address or IPv6 prefix allocated by the access system in step 2. The message includes also the IP-CAN type.\nBased e.g. on the UE identity and user profile, operator's policies and the IP-CAN type, the PCRF decides on the QoS policy rules and completes the session establishment towards the access gateway. The rules provided in this step are referred to the address assigned by the trusted non-3GPP access.\nIn the roaming case, PCC signalling is sent via a vPCRF in the VPLMN.\nNOTE 3:\tThe UE identity information to be used by the access system to establish the session with the PCRF may be piggybacked by the AAA/HSS in step 1.\nB)\tPDN GW/HA Discovery and HoA Configuration.\n4)\tThe UE discovers the PDN GW (Home Agent) as specified in clause 4.5.2 of this specification. A security association is established between UE and PDN GW to secure the DSMIPv6 messages between UE and PDN GW and for authentication between the UE and the PDN GW. The UE initiates the establishment of the security association using IKEv2, RFC 5996 [9]; EAP, RFC 3748 [11] is used over IKEv2 for authentication purposes. The PDN GW communicates with the AAA infrastructure in order to complete the EAP authentication via S6b. The APN-AMBR and Default Bearer QoS is provided to the PDN GW in this step.\nIf the PDN requires an additional authentication and authorization with an external AAA Server, an additional authentication is executed in this step. Details on these multiple authentications are specified in RFC 4739 [50] and in TS 33.402 [45] (Private Network Access (PNA)).\nDuring this step the UE may include the APN of the PDN it wants to access and it can also request the IPv6 home prefix as defined in RFC 5026 [40] in order to influence the IPv6 home network prefix assignment procedure. Even if the UE requests more than one IPv6 home prefix, the PDN GW shall assign only one IPv6 home prefix to the UE.\nDuring this step an IPv6 home prefix is assigned by the PDN GW to the UE as defined in RFC 5026 [40]. After the IPv6 home network prefix is assigned, UE constructs a home address from it via auto-configuration. The associated PDN identity (APN) shall be indicated to the UE via the IDr payload. In case the UE provided APN to the PDN GW earlier in this step, the PDN GW shall not change the provided APN.\nDuring this step, the PDN GW also informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the identity of the selected PDN GW and the APN corresponding to the UE's PDN Connection. The PDN GW also provides information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located. This information is registered in the HSS as described in clause 12.\nNOTE 4:\tThe MN NAI and APN string are delivered from the UE to the PDN GW in step 4 in order to support PCC interactions in step 6.\nC)\tBinding Update\n5)\tThe UE sends the DSMIPv6 Binding Update (IP Addresses (HoA, CoA), Lifetime) message to the PDN GW as specified in RFC 5555 [10]. The UE shall inform the PDN GW that IP address preservation shall be maintained for the whole home network prefix.\nThe PDN GW processes the binding update. During the processing the PDN GW performs authentication and authorization of the message using the IPsec security association established in Step 4. During this step the UE can request an IPv4 home address to the PDN GW as defined in RFC 5555 [10].\n6)\tIf PCC is supported, the PDN GW initiates the IP-CAN Session Establishment Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The message includes at least the HoA and the CoA. The message may also include a permanent UE identity and an APN string. The PDN GW shall provide information about the mobility protocol tunnelling header to the PCRF, the APN-AMBR and Default Bearer QoS obtained in step 4.\nThe PCRF decides on the PCC rules and Event Triggers and provisions them to the PDN GW. The PDN GW installs the received PCC rules.\nNOTE 5:\tThe permanent UE identity to be used by the PDN GW to establish the session with the PCRF may be piggybacked by the AAA/HSS in step 4.\n7)\tThe PDN GW sends the DSMIPv6 Binding Ack (Lifetime, IP Addresses (HoA, CoA)) message to the UE. In this step the PDN GW may include the duration of the binding and the IPv4 home address allocated for the UE as specified in RFC 5555 [10], if previously requested by the UE and allowed by the subscription profile as it is specified in the E-UTRAN attach procedure in TS 23.401 [4]. Even in case the UE requests more than one IPv4 home address in step 5, the PDN GW shall assign only one IPv4 home address for the UE.\n8)\tThe PCRF initiates the Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision Procedure specified in TS 23.203 [19] by sending a message with the information of mobility protocol tunnelling encapsulation header to the Trusted non 3GPP access Gateway. In case the QoS rules have changed, the updated QoS rules shall also be included in this message.\nNOTE 6:\tRules related to the HoA can be sent to the Trusted Non-3GPP Access based on the procedure in clause 6.6.2.\n",

The Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network can initiate the detach procedure due to administrative reasons or detecting the UE's leaving by, e.g. Link-layer event specific to the access technology (refer to PMIPv6 specification, RFC 5213 [8], for more information).\nFigure 6.4.1.1-1 illustrates the procedure for a User Equipment (UE) or a Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network to initiate a detach procedure or disconnect from a Public Data Network (PDN) when using Protocol for Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6). The figure shows the various stages of the process, including the UE notifying the Home Agent (HA) of its intention to detach, the HA notifying the Network Server (NS), and the NS updating its records accordingly. The figure also depicts the handover of the UE to a different network, ensuring a smooth transition and maintaining connectivity.\nFigure 6.4.1.1-1: UE/Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network initiated detach procedure or PDN-disconnection with PMIPv6\nFor detach procedure and in case of connectivity with multiple PDNs, the steps 2 to 6 are repeated for each PDN the UE is connected to.\nFor UE-requested PDN disconnection procedure, steps 2 to 6 are performed for the PDN that the UE requested disconnection from.\nThis procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1), Roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the non-3GPP access and the hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the Roaming and LBO cases, the 3GPP AAA Proxy serves as an intermediary between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA Server in the HPLMN. In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at all.\nIf dynamic policy provisioning is not deployed, the optional steps of interaction between the gateways and PCRF do not occur. Instead, the PDN GW may employ static configured policies.\n1)\tThe UE or the Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network triggers either detach or disconnection from a specific PDN by an access technology specific procedure. In the case of PDN disconnection of a PDN connection out of multiple PDN connections, the UE shall use the access specific mechanism for differentiating the PDN connections towards the same APN (see clause 6.8.1.1) to indicate the PDN connection to be deregistered and allow the Mobile Access Gateway in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access to select the corresponding PDN connection identity needed in step 3 (e.g. the UE informs the Trusted Non-3GPP access of the prefix to be disconnected).\n2)\tThe Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network initiates the Gateway Control Session Termination Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network no longer applies QoS policy to traffic flows for this UE.\n3)\tThe Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access sends a Proxy Binding Update (MN NAI, APN, lifetime=0) message to the PDN GW with lifetime value set to zero, indicating de-registration. The MN NAI identifies the UE to deregister from the PDN GW. When only one PDN connection to the given APN is allowed the APN is needed in order to determine which PDN to deregister the UE from, as some PDN GWs may support multiple PDNs. When multiple PDN connections to the given APN are supported the APN and the PDN connection identity are needed in order to determine which PDN to deregister the UE from.\n4)\tThe PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN disconnection.

The resources of Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network are released. In case of disconnection from a PDN, if the PDN from which the UE is disconnected was the only PDN that the UE was connected to, detach related procedures may be performed in the Trusted non-3GPP IP access.\nThis clause defines the UE/Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access Network-initiated detach procedure UE-requested PDN disconnection procedure for PMIP-based S8-S2a chaining. This procedure also applies to UE/ePDG-initiated detach procedure for PMIP-based S8-S2b chaining.\nFigure 6.4.1.2-1 illustrates the UE/ePDG/Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network initiated detach procedure for chained PMIP-based S8-S2a/b roaming scenarios and PDN-disconnection for chained PMIP-based S8-S2a. The figure depicts the process of a user equipment (UE) disconnecting from a non-3GPP access network and transitioning to a trusted network. The figure shows the various stages of the procedure, including the initiation of the detach procedure, the establishment of a new connection with the trusted network, and the disconnection from the non-3GPP access network. The figure also shows the role of the ePDG (Evolved Packet Data Gateway) in facilitating the transition between networks. The figure is a valuable resource for understanding the complex process of roaming and network disconnection in the context of 5G networks.\nFigure 6.4.1.2-1: UE/ePDG/Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network initiated detach procedure for chained PMIP-based S8-S2a/b roaming scenarios and PDN-disconnection for chained PMIP-based S8-S2a\nFor detach procedure and in case of connectivity with multiple PDNs, the steps 2 to 7 are repeated for each PDN the UE is connected to.\nFor UE-requested PDN disconnection procedure for chained PMIP-based S8-S2a, steps 2 to 7 are performed for the PDN that the UE requested disconnection from.\n1)\tFor detach, initial steps of the detach is performed as described in steps 1-2 of clause 6.4.1.1 (for trusted non-3GPP access) and step 1 of clause 7.4.1.1 (for untrusted non-3GPP access).

The figure depicts two scenarios, S2a and S2c, where the UE communicates with the Network Equipment (NE) to allocate or return resources. The UE sends a request to the NE, which then coordinates with the Serving Gateway (SGW) and the Packet Data Network Gateway (P-GW) to allocate the necessary resources. Once the resources are allocated, the UE can transmit data. Conversely, when the UE no longer requires the resources, it releases them, allowing other UEs to utilize the network.

This procedure is also used to request for connectivity to an additional PDN over trusted non-3GPP access with PMIPv6 on S2a when the UE is simultaneously connected to such trusted access and a 3GPP access, and the UE already has active PDN connections over both the accesses.\nThe procedure is also used for the re-establishment of existing PDN connectivity after the UE performed the handover from 3GPP accesses for the first PDN connection by the Attach procedure.\nEstablishment of connectivity to an additional PDN over trusted access with S2a is supported only for the accesses that support such feature and the UEs that have such capability.\nPMIPv6 specification, RFC 5213 [8], is used to setup an IP connectivity between the trusted non-3GPP IP access and the EPC during initial attach. In both roaming and non-roaming cases, S2a is present. It is assumed that MAG exists in the trusted non-3GPP IP access.\nThere can be more than one PDN connection per APN if both the MAG and the PDN GW support that feature. When multiple PDN connections to a single APN are supported, during the establishment of a new PMIP tunnel, the MAG creates and sends a PDN Connection identity to the PDN GW. The PDN connection identity is unique in the scope of the UE and the APN and within a Trusted non-3GPP access network, i.e. the MN-ID, the APN, and the PDN connection identity together identify a PDN connection within a Trusted non-3GPP access network. In order to be able to identify a specific established PDN connection, both the MAG and the PDN GW shall store the PDN Connection identity. Sending the PDN connection identity is an indication that the MAG supports multiple PDN connections to a single APN and the PDN GW shall be able to indicate if it supports multiple PDN connections to a single APN.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen multiple PDN connections to a single APN are used, the MN-ID and the APN together is not enough to identify the PDN connection. Therefore between the UE and MAG an access network specific mechanism is needed to differentiate the PDN connections to the same APN. Differentiating the PDN connections within one access is needed in order to operate on the correct PDN connection, e.g. when the PDN connection is removed. Differentiating the PDN connections across accesses, e.g. during handover, is not needed. The specification of such a mechanism is out of scope of 3GPP.\nFigure 6.8.1.1-1 illustrates the additional point-to-point (P2P) Direct Connectivity over the Session Border Controller (SBC) using Network-based Multi-homing (NBH) mechanism over Session Border Controller (S2a) for non-roaming and roaming scenarios. The figure depicts the network architecture with various components such as the SBC, S2a, and the NBH. The NBH mechanism allows for multiple network connections, enhancing redundancy and improving overall network performance. The figure also highlights the role of the SBC in managing and controlling the network traffic, ensuring secure and efficient communication between different network entities.\nFigure 6.8.1.1-1: Additional PDN connectivity with Network-based MM mechanism over S2a for non-roaming and roaming\nThe steps in the procedure which are marked as optional occur only if dynamic policy provisioning has been deployed.\nIn the roaming case, messages are forwarded between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the hPCRF via the vPCRF. In the case of LBO, messages are forwarded between the PDN GW and the hPCRF via the vPCRF also. Further, in the case of LBO, messages between the PDN GW and the 3GPP AAA Server are sent via the 3GPP AAA Proxy.\n1)\tWhen the UE wishes to connect to an additional PDN, it sends a trigger indicating that connectivity with that specific PDN is desired. The UE provides information about the new PDN by using an APN. When multiple PDN connections to a single APN are supported then some additional access specific mechanism is needed between the UE and the MAG to differentiate the PDN connections towards the same APN. If supported by the non-3GPP access, the UE may send Protocol Configuration Options in this step using access specific mechanisms. The Protocol Configuration Options provided by the UE may include the user credentials for PDN access authorization. The UE triggers the re-establishment of existing PDN connectivity after the handover by providing a Request Type indicating \"Handover\" on accesses that support the indication.\nNOTE 2:\tThe definition of the trigger that the UE provides to the access network (MAG) is out of scope of 3GPP.\n2)\tAt this step the trusted non-3GPP IP access performs PDN GW selection as described in clause 4.5.1. Steps 4 to 10 according to clause 6.2.1 are executed with PDN GW2 instead of PDN GW1.\n3)\tThe trusted non-3GPP IP access system sends the reply message to the UE with the allocated IP address from the PDN that the UE indicated at step 1. If supported by the non-3GPP access, the Protocol Configuration Options provided by the PDN GW in step 2 are returned to the UE in this step using access specific mechanisms. Since UE requested for additional PDN connectivity, the UE configures the IP address received from the MAG without deleting its configuration for connectivity with any other previously established PDN. For handover, the UE is returned the IP address the UE obtained before the handover during PDN connectivity establishment.\nNOTE 3:\tThe definition of the message used to carry the new connectivity information to the UE is out of scope of 3GPP.\n4)\tThe PMIPv6 tunnel is thus set up between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the PDN GW corresponding to the requested additional PDN while maintaining tunnels previously established for other PDNs.\nThis clause defines the UE-initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN for PMIP-based S8-S2a chaining. This procedure also applies for PMIP-based S8-S2b chaining.\nMultiple PDN connections to a single APN can be established if it is supported by the MAG, the Serving GW and the PDN GW. When multiple PDN connections to a single APN are supported, during the establishment of a new PDN connection, the use of PDN connection identity is used as specified in clause 6.8.1.1 and the Serving GW shall forward the PDN connection identity between the concatenated PMIP tunnels.\nFigure 6.8.1.2-1 illustrates the additional point-to-point (P2P) data network (PDN) connectivity for chained peer-to-multipoint-based (PMIP) S8-S2a/b roaming scenarios. The figure showcases the network architecture, including the point-to-multipoint (P2MP) and point-to-point (P2P) connections, as well as the interworking of the S8 and S2a/b interfaces. The figure highlights the importance of efficient roaming management and seamless handover between different network types for maintaining uninterrupted service quality during user mobility.\nFigure 6.8.1.2-1: Additional PDN connectivity for chained PMIP-based S8-S2a/b roaming scenarios\nThe optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway.\nThe gateway control signalling in steps 2 and 4 between the gateway and PCRF occur only for Trusted Non-3GPP IP Accesses.\n1)\tWhen the UE wishes to connect to an additional PDN, it sends a trigger according to step 1 of clause 6.8.1.1 (Figure 6.8.1.1-1).\n2)\tThe non-3GPP access gateway initiates the Gateway Control Session Establishment Procedure with the hPCRF by way of the vPCRF, as specified in TS 23.203 [19].\n3)\tSteps 2 to 7 according to clause 6.2.4 (Figure 6.2.4-1) are executed with PDN GW2 instead of PDN GW1.\n4)\tIn case the QoS rules have changed, the hPCRF by way of the vPCRF updates the QoS rules at the non-3GPP access gateway by initiating the GW Control Session Modification Procedure, as specified in TS 23.203 [19].\n5)\tThe trusted non-3GPP access system or ePDG sends the reply message to the UE according to step 3 of clause 6.8.1.1 (Figure 6.8.1.1-1).

In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the Roaming and LBO cases, the 3GPP AAA Proxy serves as an intermediary between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA Server in the HPLMN. In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at all.\n1)\tWhen the UE wishes to connect to an additional PDN, UE sends a Registration Request (RRQ) (MN-NAI, lifetime, APN) RFC 5944 [12] message to the FA as specified in RFC 5944 [12].

The UE may not indicate a specific Home Agent address in the RRQ message, in which case the PDN Gateway/Home Agent is selected by the FA. The UE then receives the IP address of the PDN Gateway in step 3 as part of the Registration Reply (RRP) message. The UE should then include the PDN Gateway address in the Home Agent address field of subsequent RRQ messages. The UE provides information about the new PDN by using an APN as specified in RFC 5446 [39].\n2)\tThe trusted non-3GPP IP access performs a PDN GW selection for the new PDN connection.

If the target PDN GW identity is stored in the HSS in form of the PDN GW FQDN, the initial PDN GW shall derive the IP address of the HA functionality of the target PDN GW from the PDN GW FQDN provided by the AAA server and provide it to the UE.\n3)\tThe UE establishes the DSMIPv6 SA with the target PDN GW provided by the network during step 2.\n4)\tThe UE performs the DSMIPv6 registration with the target PDN GW.\nNOTE 1:\tIn case the UE performs DSMIPv6 bootstrapping for an existing PDN connection, the UE includes its IPv6 Home Address during step 2.\nNOTE 2:\tThe DSMIPv6 SA between the UE and the initial PDN GW may be implicitly removed by the UE and the initial PDN GW any time after step 2, before expiry of the SA.\n",

It is assumed that MAG is collocated with ePDG. The IPsec tunnel between the UE and the ePDG provides a virtual point-to-point link between the UE and the MAG functionality on the ePDG.\nFigure 7.2.1-1 illustrates the initial attachment process over the Packet Mobile Internet Protocol (PMIP) based S2b for both roaming and non-roaming scenarios, as well as Local Breakout (LBO) procedures. The figure showcases the various stages of attachment, including the establishment of a connection between the mobile device and the service provider's network. The diagram highlights the role of the Session Border Controller (SBC) and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) signaling in facilitating seamless communication. The figure emphasizes the importance of efficient attachment processes for a smooth user experience and highlights the interconnection of different network elements, such as the Home Location Register (HLR), Visitor Location Register (VLR), and Mobility Management Entity (MME), in managing mobile data traffic.\nFigure 7.2.1-1: Initial attachment over PMIP based S2b for roaming, non-roaming and LBO\nNOTE 1:\tFor GTP based S2b, procedure steps (A) to (E) are defined in clause 7.2.4.\nNOTE 2:\tBefore the UE initiates the setup of an IPsec tunnel with the ePDG it configures an IP address from an untrusted non-3GPP IP access network. This address is used for sending all IKEv2, RFC 5996 [9] messages and as the source address on the outer header of the IPsec tunnel.\nThe home routed roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1), LBO (Figure 4.2.3-4) and non-roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1) scenarios are depicted in the figure.\n-\tIn the LBO case, the 3GPP AAA Proxy acts as an intermediary, forwarding messages from the 3GPP AAA Server in the HPLMN to the PDN GW in the VPLMN and visa versa. Messages between the PDN GW in the VPLMN and the hPCRF in the HPLMN are forwarded by the vPCRF in the VPLMN.\n-\tIn the home routed roaming and non-roaming case, the vPCRF and the 3GPP AAA Proxy are not involved.\nIf dynamic policy provisioning is not deployed, the optional step 3 does not occur. Instead, the PDN GW may employ static configured policies.\nThis procedure is also used to establish the first PDN connection over an untrusted non-3GPP access with PMIPv6 on S2b when the UE already has active PDN connections only over a 3GPP access and wishes to establish simultaneous PDN connections to different APNs over multiple accesses.\nThe UE may be authenticated and authorised to access the Untrusted Non-3GPP Access network with an access network specific procedure. These procedures are outside the scope of 3GPP.\n1)\tThe Access authentication procedure between UE and the 3GPP EPC may be performed as defined by TS 33.402 [45]. In the roaming case signalling may be routed via a 3GPP AAA Proxy in the VPLMN. As part of the AAA exchange for network access authentication, the AAA/HSS and/or the 3GPP AAA Proxy may return to the Non-3GPP IP Access a set of home/visited operator's policies to be enforced on the usage of local IP address, or IPv6 prefix, allocated by the access system upon successful authentication. Subscription data is provided to the Non-3GPP IP Access by the HSS/AAA in this step.\n2)\tThe IKEv2 tunnel establishment procedure is started by the UE. The UE may indicate in a notification part of the IKEv2 authentication request that it supports MOBIKE. The ePDG IP address to which the UE needs to form IPsec tunnel is discovered via DNS query as specified in clause 4.5.4. The UE may request connectivity to a specific PDN providing an APN, that is conveyed with IKEv2 as specified in TS 33.402 [45]. For networks supporting multiple mobility protocols, if there was any dynamic IPMS decision involved in this step, the decision is stored in the 3GPP AAA Server. The PDN GW information is returned as part of the reply from the 3GPP AAA Server to the ePDG as described in clause 4.5.1. If the UE has provided an APN the ePDG verifies that it is allowed by subscription. If the UE has not provided an APN the ePDG uses the default APN. The PDN GW selection takes place at this point as described in clause 4.5.1. This may entail an additional name resolution step, issuing a request to a DNS Server. If there is no requested IP address in the CFG_Request from the UE to the ePDG which indicates the attach is an initial attach, the ePDG may perform a new PDN GW selection procedure as described in clause 4.5.1, e.g. to allocate a PDN GW that allows for more efficient routeing. The UE shall indicate the type of address(es) (IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix /address or both) in the CFG_Request sent to the ePDG during IKEv2 message exchange. If the PDN requires an additional authentication and authorisation with an external AAA Server, the UE includes the authentication credentials in this step as specified in RFC 4739 [50] and in TS 33.402 [45]. As part of the IKEv2 tunnel establishment procedure, the ePDG may request the UE to provide its IMEI(SV). In that case the UE shall signal its IMEI(SV) to the ePDG. The ePDG forwards the IMEI(SV) received from the UE to the 3GPP AAA Server (over SWm).\n2a)\tIf IMEI check is required by operator policy and if the ePDG is in the HPLMN, the IMEI check shall be performed by the EIR in the home country. The 3GPP AAA server shall request the EIR to perform the IMEI check by sending the ME Identity Check Request (ME Identity, IMSI) to the EIR. Upon receiving the ME Identity Check Ack (Result) from the EIR, the 3GPP AAA server shall determine whether to continue or to stop the authentication and authorization procedure. If the 3GPP AAA server determines that the authentication and authorization procedure shall be stopped, it shall reply to the ePDG with a failure message with appropriate cause value.\n2b)\tIf IMEI check is required by operator policy and if the ePDG is in the visited PLMN, the IMEI check shall be performed by the EIR in the visited country. The 3GPP AAA proxy shall request the EIR to perform the IMEI check by sending the ME Identity Check Request (ME Identity, IMSI) to the EIR. Upon receiving the ME Identity Check Ack (Result) from the EIR, the 3GPP AAA proxy shall determine whether to continue or to stop the authentication and authorization procedure. If the 3GPP AAA proxy determines that the authentication and authorization procedure shall be stopped, the 3GPP AAA Proxy shall reply to the ePDG with a failure message with appropriate cause value.\n3)\tThe ePDG sends the Proxy Binding Update (MN-NAI, Lifetime, APN, Access Technology Type, Handover Indicator, GRE key for downlink traffic, UE Address Info, Charging Characteristics, Additional Parameters, IMEI(SV) if available) message to the PDN GW. Access Technology Type option is set to a value matching the characteristics of the non-3GPP IP access. Handover Indicator is set to indicate attachment over a new interface. The proxy binding update message shall be secured. The MN NAI identifies the UE. The Lifetime field must be set to a nonzero value in the case of a registration and a zero value in the case of a de-registration. The APN is used by the PDN GW to determine which PDN to establish connectivity for, in the case that the PDN GW supports multiple PDN connectivity. The ePDG creates and includes a PDN connection identity if the ePDG supports multiple PDN connections to a single APN. The UE Address Info shall be set based on the CFG_Request in step 1 and subscription profile in the same way as the PDN type is selected during the E-UTRAN Initial Attach in TS 23.401 [4]. The Additional Parameters include the authentication credentials for an additional authentication and authorization with an external AAA server if it was provided by the UE in step 2. The PDN GW performs the authentication and authorization with the external AAA server if it is required to get access for the given APN as specified in TS 33.402 [45].\n4)\tThe PDN GW initiates the IP CAN Session Establishment Procedure with the PCRF, as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. If available, the PCRF provides the APN-AMBR and Default Bearer QoS to the PDN GW in the response message.\n5)\tThe selected PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN GW identity. The 3GPP AAA Server then informs the HSS of the PDN GW identity and APN associated with the UE's PDN Connection. The message includes information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located. This information is registered in the HSS as described in clause 12. The PDN GW shall only use the APN-AMBR and Default Bearer QoS received from the 3GPP AAA server in this step if these parameters have not been received in step 4.\n6)\tThe PDN GW processes the proxy binding update and creates a binding cache entry for the UE. The PDN GW allocates an IP address for the UE. The PDN GW then sends a Proxy Binding Ack (MN NAI, UE Address Info, GRE Key for uplink traffic, Charging ID) message to the ePDG, including the IP address(es) allocated for the UE (identified by the MN NAI). If the corresponding Proxy Binding Update contains the PDN connection identity, the PDN GW shall acknowledge if multiple PDN connections to the given APN are supported. The Charging ID is assigned for the PDN connection for charging correlation purposes.\nNOTE 3:\tIf UE requests for both IPv4 address and IPv6 prefix, both are allocated. If the PDN GW operator dictates the use of IPv4 address only or IPv6 prefix only for this APN, the PDN GW shall allocate the only IPv4 address or only IPv6 prefix to the UE. If the UE requests for only IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix only one address/prefix is allocated accordingly.\nNOTE 4:\tThe ePDG learns from the PBA whether the PDN GW supports multiple PDN connection to the same APN or not.\n7)\tAfter the Proxy Binding Update is successful, the ePDG is authenticated by the UE and indicates to the UE that the authentication and authorization with the external AAA server is successful.\n8)\tThe ePDG sends the final IKEv2 message with the IP address in IKEv2 Configuration payloads. The ePDG also includes the identity of the associated PDN (APN) in the IDr payload of IKEv2. In case the UE provided APN to the ePDG in the earlier steps, the ePDG shall not change the provided APN.\n9)\tIP connectivity from the UE to the PDN GW is now setup. Any packet in the uplink direction is tunnelled to the ePDG by the UE using the IPSec tunnel. The ePDG then tunnels the packet to the PDN GW. From the PDN GW normal IP-based routing takes place. In the downlink direction, the packet for UE (HoA) arrives at the PDN GW. The PDN GW tunnels the packet based on the binding cache entry to the ePDG. The ePDG then tunnels the packet to the UE via proper IPsec tunnel.\n",

The IPsec tunnel between the UE and the ePDG provides a virtual point-to-point link between the UE and the ePDG.\nFigure 7.2.4-1 illustrates the initial attachment process over GTP for S2b, which is used for roaming, non-roaming, and Local Breakout (LBO) scenarios in a telecommunication network. The figure depicts the establishment of a connection between the home network and the visited network, with various signaling protocols and procedures involved. The visual representation emphasizes the importance of secure and efficient handover mechanisms in ensuring seamless connectivity for mobile users during their journey.\nFigure 7.2.4-1: Initial attachment over GTP based S2b for roaming, non-roaming and LBO\nThe home routed roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1), LBO (Figure 4.2.3-4) and non-roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1) scenarios are depicted in the figure.\n-\tIn the LBO case, the 3GPP AAA Proxy acts as an intermediary, forwarding messages from the 3GPP AAA Server in the HPLMN to the PDN GW in the VPLMN and visa versa. Messages between the PDN GW in the VPLMN and the hPCRF in the HPLMN are forwarded by the vPCRF in the VPLMN.\n-\tIn the home routed roaming and non-roaming case, the vPCRF and the 3GPP AAA Proxy are not involved.\nThis procedure is also used to establish the first PDN connection over an untrusted non-3GPP access with GTP on S2b when the UE already has active PDN connections only over a 3GPP access and wishes to establish simultaneous PDN connections to different APNs over multiple accesses.\nThe UE may be authenticated and authorised to access the Untrusted Non-3GPP Access network with an access network specific procedure. These procedures are outside the scope of 3GPP.\nFor GTP, and WLAN access, the Attach procedure as in Figure 7.2.1-1, before step (A), has the following additions:\n-\tIn step 1, the subscription data that is provided to the Non-3GPP IP Access by the HSS/AAA shall also include the MPS subscription, if any.\n-\tIn step 2, when the IKEv2 tunnel establishment procedure is started by the UE, a UE having a USIM with MPS subscription and supports MPS over untrusted WLAN feature shall indicate in a notification part of the IKEv2 authentication request that it has an MPS subscription.\nNOTE 1:\tBased on operator policy, the MPS subscription indication can be used by the ePDG to give priority to this UE immediately upon receipt of the notification from the UE. In this case, the ePDG forwards the message to the 3GPP AAA Server with priority and the ePDG and HSS/AAA handle all subsequent messages with priority. Alternatively, the ePDG may give priority to this UE after the network has successfully authenticated the UE, at which time the ePDG and HSS/AAA handle all subsequent messages with priority.\nA.1)\tStep A.1 is the same as Step A of clause 7.2.1, with the following addition:\n-\tupon a successful authorization, the 3GPP AAA server returns the following additional information, regardless of which protocol variant the ePDG will select on S2b : APN-AMBR, static QoS Profile, MPS subscription indication and Trace Information (Trace Reference, Trace Type, Trigger Id, OMC Identity) if applicable. When the 3GPP AAA server has WLAN Location Information about the UE, it provides it over SWm to the ePDG together with the Age of this information. The WLAN Location information is provided to the ePDG only when the 3GPP AAA server considers that location information coming from the WLAN AN used by the UE is trustable.\nIn addition to the above, the UE shall indicate at Initial Attach its capabilities, and whether it supports multiple IPsec SAs, so the ePDG can apply the necessary applicable procedures in this case.\nNOTE 2:\tSending the static QoS profile to the ePDG enables the ePDG to enforce QoS policies based on information received via AAA infrastructure as specified in clause 4.3.4. When GTP is used over S2b, this also allows the PGW to receive the QoS parameters possibly modified by the 3GPP AAA Proxy (when the ePDG is located in the VPLMN) to enforce QoS limitations according to the local policies and the roaming agreement with the home operator. The ePDG does not perform rate enforcement based on APN-AMBR.\nNOTE 3:\tThis also allows to align the GTP operations on S5/S8/S2b, i.e. the PGW receives those parameters within GTP signalling on all GTP interfaces.\nNOTE 4:\tSimilar to 3GPP-access, sending the MPS subscription to the ePDG enables the ePDG to handle this UE with priority.\n-\tIf it supports emergency services, the ePDG shall provide the UE with the corresponding indication as part of the IKEv2 tunnel establishment procedure.\nB.1)\tThe ePDG sends a Create Session Request (IMSI, APN, RAT type, ePDG TEID for control plane, PDN Type, PDN Address, EPS Bearer Identity, Default EPS Bearer QoS, ePDG Address for the user plane, ePDG TEID of the user plane, APN-AMBR, Selection Mode, Dual Address Bearer Flag, Trace Information, Charging Characteristics, Additional Parameters, IMEI(SV), User Location Information) message to the PGW. The RAT type indicates the non-3GPP IP access technology type. The PDN Type shall be set based on the CFG_Request in step 1 and subscription profile in the same way as the PDN type is selected during the E-UTRAN Initial Attach in TS 23.401 [4]. The ePDG shall set the Dual Address Bearer Flag when the PDN type is set to IPv4v6 and all SGSNs which the UE may be handed over to are Release 8 or above supporting dual addressing, which is determined based on node pre-configuration by the operator. The ePDG shall include Trace Information if PDN GW trace is activated. The Additional Parameters include the authentication credentials for an additional authentication and authorization with an external AAA server if it was provided by the UE before this step. The ePDG shall provide the IMEI(SV) if available; The PDN GW performs the authentication and authorization with the external AAA server if it is required to get access for the given APN. The User Location Information shall include UE local IP address and optionally UDP or TCP source port number (if NAT is detected). It may also include WLAN Location Information (and its Age) the ePDG may have received from the 3GPP AAA server about the UE.\nNOTE 5:\tThe UE local IP address is the source address on the outer header of the IPsec tunnel to the ePDG.\nThe PGW creates a new entry in its bearer context table and generates a Charging Id.

The PDN GW selects the PDN type to be used in the same way as done during the E-UTRAN Initial Attach in TS 23.401 [4].\nThe PGW may initiate the creation of dedicated bearers on GTP based S2b (like it may do it on GTP based S5/S8 for an Attach on 3GPP access).\nNOTE 7:\tIf the UE requests for both IPv4 address and IPv6 prefix, both are allocated. If the PDN GW operator dictates the use of IPv4 address only or IPv6 prefix only for this APN, the PDN GW shall allocate the only IPv4 address or only IPv6 prefix to the UE.

The Initial Attach for emergency session follows the same steps that the Initial Attach for a non emergency session, so only the differences with regard to the procedures described in clauses 7.2.1 and 7.2.4 are documented.\nFigure 7.2.5-1 illustrates the initial attachment process for emergency services over GTP-based S2b, showcasing the establishment of a secure connection between the service provider's network and the emergency service provider. The figure depicts the interaction between the service provider's GTP-U device and the emergency service provider's GTP-C device, highlighting the key components involved in the process, such as the GTP tunnel, GTP-U and GTP-C sessions, and the GTP-U and GTP-C devices. The figure emphasizes the importance of establishing a reliable and secure connection for emergency services, ensuring that they can communicate effectively with the service provider's network.\nFigure 7.2.5-1: Initial attachment for emergency services over GTP based S2b\n1)\tAs in step 1 of Figure 7.2.1 with following modifications:\nAs part of procedures for Authentication and Authorization on an Access Point based NAI defined in clause 4.6.3,the 3GPP AAA server may store WLAN Location Information defined in clause 4.5.7.2.8.\n2)\tThe UE releases any connectivity it may have over Un-trusted access to EPC per the procedure defined in clause 7.4.3. The UE does not need to wait the procedure defined in clause 7.4.3 to be completed to proceed with following steps: the UE shall select an ePDG that supports emergency services as defined in clause 4.5.4a and initiate an IKEv2 tunnel establishment procedure as in step 2 of clause 7.2.1 but with following specificities:\n-\tThe behaviour defined in clause 4.5.7.2.1 shall apply.\n-\tThe UE provides an indication that the EPC access is for emergency services.The indication is used by the 3GPP AAA server to give precedence to this session in case of signalling congestion (over SWx) and for authenticated UE without roaming permission to not carry out roaming and location checks for this UE. The indication is used by the ePDG to apply specific policies related with emergency PDN connection (e.g. stored in Emergency Configuration Data).\n-\tFor an Emergency Attach, the IMEI check to the EIR may be performed. Dependent upon the result, the 3GPP AAA server or 3GPP AAA proxy (roaming case with ePDG in VPLMN) decides whether to continue or to stop the authentication and authorization procedure is based on operator policies.\n-\tAny APN received by the ePDG from the UE is ignored as the ePDG uses its Emergency Configuration Data to determine the APN to be associated with the emergency PDN connection and possibly to determine the PDN GW to use.\nNOTE 1:\tNo procedure for additional authentication and authorisation with an external AAA Server as specified in RFC 4739 [50] and in TS 33.402 [45] is expected.\n-\tDuring the IKE tunnel establishment procedure, the identity provided by the UE in IKE_AUTH message to the ePDG is defined in clause 4.6.3. When local policies (related with local regulations) allow unauthenticated emergency sessions, the ePDG forwards the EAP payload received from the UE to the 3GPP AAA Server in the VPLMN serving the specific domain for unauthenticated emergency access.\n-\tif the UE includes an identity based on IMEI and the ePDG is not configured to support Unauthenticated Emergency Attach (i.e for supporting cases c and d as defined in TS 23.401 [4] clause 4.3.12), the ePDG shall reject the Emergency Attach Request.\n-\tif the UE did not include the IMEI in the identity and the ePDG is configured for supporting Unauthenticated Emergency Attach (per cases c and d as defined in TS 23.401 [4] clause 4.3.12), the ePDG shall request the IMEI from the UE.\nEditor's note:\tThe enhancement of authentication procedure defined in TS 33.402 [45] for an unthenticated UE, i.e. UE without valid IMSI or without IMSI, is outside the scope of SA2. The reference to SA3 specification will be added when available.\n-\tUpon a successful authorization by the 3GPP AAA server, the ePDG stores subscription information if they are received from the 3GPP AAA, but does not use this information for the emergency PDN connection. It instead uses Emergency Configuration Data to get information on the APN and possibly PDN GW and / or QoS (APN-AMBR, default QoS) to use for the emergency PDN connection.\n3)\tThe ePDG sends a Create Session Request message to the PGW as described in step B.1 of clause 7.2.4 but with following specificities:\n-\tNo parameter sent in the Create Session Request message is related with the user subscription. Parameters in the Emergency Configuration Data are used instead.\n-\tNo Additional Parameters are provided for additional authentication and authorisation with an external AAA Server.\n-\tThe PDN GW deduces the emergency related policies to apply from the APN received in the Create Session Request message.\n-\tFor emergency attached UEs, if the IMSI cannot be authenticated or the UE has not provided it (according to cases c) and d) as defined in TS 23.401 [4] clause 4.3.12), then the IMEI shall be used as UE identifier.\n4)\tAs Step 4 of clause 7.2.1, with the following specificities:\n-\tThe PCRF deduces the emergency related policies to apply from the APN received in the IP-CAN Session Establishment message.\n5)\tAs in step C.1 of clause 7.2.4, with the following specificities:\n-\tThe PDN GW sends an Emergency indication over S6b in order for the 3GPP AAA server to be able to apply specific policies for emergency services. For a UE without UICC or with an unauthenticated IMSI or a roaming authenticated UE, the 3GPP AAA server does not update the HSS with the identity of the PDN GW. For a non-roaming authenticated UE, based on operator policy, this indication may be sent together with the \"PDN GW currently in use for emergency services\", which comprises the PDN GW address and the indication that the PDN connection is for emergency services to the HSS, which stores it as part of the UE context for emergency services.\n6)\tAs in step D.1 of clause 7.2.4.\n7)\tAs in step E.1 of clause 7.2.4, with the following specificities:\n-\tNo APN is provided by the ePDG in the IDr payload of the final IKEv2 message.\n",

                    "text_content": "This clause is related to the case when the UE powers-on in an untrusted network and host-based mobility management mechanism is used to establish IP connectivity and to perform inter-access Handover. Dual Stack MIPv6, RFC 5555 [10] is used for supporting mobility over S2c interface.\nFigure 7.3-1 illustrates the initial attachment process from an untrusted non-3GPP IP access network to a 5G core network using Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 (DSMIPv6). The figure depicts the various stages of the process, including the untrusted network's initial connection to the 5G core network, the establishment of a secure tunnel using DTLS, and the subsequent handover to the 5G network. The figure highlights the importance of DSMIPv6 in enabling seamless mobility and security for 5G networks, particularly in scenarios where traditional IPsec-based solutions may not be sufficient.\nFigure 7.3-1: Initial attachment from Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access with DSMIPv6\nThe non-roaming (Figure 4.2.2-2), Roaming (Figure 4.2.3-3) and LBO (Figure 4.2.3-5) are all covered in this procedure. In the Roaming and LBO case, the ePDG communicates with the 3GPP AAA Server by way of the 3GPP AAA Proxy, functioning as a relay for AAA messages. In the LBO case, the PDN GW in the VPLMN interacts with the PCRF by means of the vPCRF. In the non-roaming case, the 3GPP AAA Proxy and vPCRF are not involved.\nThis procedure is also used to establish the first PDN connection over an untrusted non-3GPP access with DSMIPv6 on S2c when the UE already has active PDN connections only over a 3GPP access and wishes to establish simultaneous PDN connections to different APNs over multiple accesses.\nIf dynamic policy provisioning is not deployed, the optional step 6 does not occur. Instead, the PDN GW may employ static configured policies.\n1)\tThe Access authentication procedure between UE and the 3GPP EPC may be performed as defined by TS 33.402 [45]. As part of the AAA exchange for network access authentication, the AAA/HSS and/or the 3GPP AAA Proxy may return to the Non-3GPP IP Access a set of home/visited operator's policies to be enforced on the usage of local IP address, or IPv6 prefix, allocated by the access system upon successful authentication. Subscription data is provided to the Non-3GPP IP Access by the HSS/AAA in this step. After the authentication, UE is configured with Local IP Address from the access network domain. This address is used for sending all IKEv2, RFC 5996 [9] messages and as the source address on the outer header of the IPsec tunnel between the UE and the ePDG.\n2)\tThe IKEv2 tunnel establishment procedure is started by the UE. The UE may indicate in a notification part of the IKEv2 authentication request that it supports MOBIKE. The ePDG IP address to which the UE needs to form IPsec tunnel is discovered via DNS query as specified in clause 4.5.4. The procedure is as described in TS 33.402 [45].\n3)\tThe ePDG sends the final IKEv2 message with the assigned IP address in IKEv2 Configuration payloads.\n4)\tIPsec Tunnel between the UE and ePDG is now setup.\n5)\tA security association is established between UE and PDN GW to secure the DS-MIPv6 messages between UE and PDN GW. This step is performed as specified in step 4 of clause 6.3. During this step an IPv6 home network prefix is assigned by the PDN GW to the UE as defined in RFC 5026 [40]. After the IPv6 home network prefix is assigned, UE constructs a home address from it via auto-configuration.\n6)\tThe UE sends the Binding Update (IP Addresses (HoA, CoA)) message to the PDN GW. The Binding Update is as specified in RFC 5555 [10]. The UE may request an IPv4 Home Address in this step. The UE shall inform the PDN GW that the whole home prefix shall be moved.\n7)\tThe PDN GW executes a IP-CAN Session Establishment Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The message from the PDG GW includes at least the HoA and the CoA. The message may also include a permanent UE identity and an APN string.\nThe PCRF decides on the PCC rules and Event Triggers and provisions them to the PDN GW. The PDN GW installs the received PCC rules.\n8)\tThe PDN GW processes the binding update and creates a binding cache entry for the UE. The PDN GW allocates an IPv4 home address for the UE if requested by the UE in step 5 and allowed by the subscription profile received as it is specified in the E-UTRAN attach procedure in TS 23.401 [4]. The PDN GW then sends a Binding Ack to the UE, including the IPv4 home address allocated for the UE.\n9)\tThe IP Connectivity is now setup.\n",

If the default bearer belonging to a PDN connection is deactivated, the PDN GW deactivates all bearers belonging to the PDN connection.\nWhen it is performed for a handover, the connections associated with the PDN address are released, but the PDN address is kept in the PDN GW.\nFigure 7.9.2-1 illustrates the process of PDN Gateway (PGW) initiated bearer deactivation with Generic Terminal Process (GTP) on Session Border Control (SBC) S2b. The figure depicts the various components involved, including the SBC S2b, GTP, and the PDN Gateway. The process begins with the SBC S2b initiating the deactivation request, which is then forwarded to the PGW. The PGW processes the request and sends a confirmation back to the SBC S2b. The figure also shows the signaling between the SBC S2b and the PGW, highlighting the importance of accurate signaling for successful deactivation.\nFigure 7.9.2-1: PDN GW Initiated Bearer Deactivation with GTP on S2b\nThis procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1), Roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the non-roaming and home routed roaming cases, the vPCRF is not involved at all.\nThe optional interaction steps between the PDN GW and the PCRF in the procedures in figure 7.9.2.1-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured within the PDN GW.\n1.\tIf dynamic PCC is deployed, the PDN GW initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure may for example be triggered due to 'IP CAN session Modification procedure', as defined in TS 23.203 [19]. In this case, the resources associated with the PDN connection in the PDN GW are released. The PCRF may also include a request to provide the User Location Info to the PDN GW.\nThe PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation can also be triggered during handovers from Non-3GPP to 3GPP.\n2.\tThe PDN GW sends a Delete Bearer Request message (EPS Bearer Identity or Linked EPS Bearer Identity, Cause) to the ePDG. The Linked EPS Bearer Identity shall be present and set to the identity of the default bearer associated with the PDN connection if the PDN GW requests to release all the bearers of the PDN connection. Otherwise, the EPS Bearer Identity shall be present and set to the identity of the dedicated S2b bearer(s) to release if the PDN GW requests to deactivate dedicated S2b bearer(s).\nStep 3a only applies if both the UE, and the ePDG support a separate IPsec Security associations per dedicated S2b bearer.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the Delete Bearer Request includes a list of EPS Bearers, as defined in TS 29.274 [57], then step 3a shall be performed for each dedicated S2b bearer in that list.\n3a.\tIf the PDN connection has multiple active S2b bearers, and the ePDG maintained a binding with a IPsec SA for the S2b bearer that is being released, then it shall use the IKEv2 INFORMATIONAL exchange with Delete Payloads, as defined in [9], to remove the IPsec SA between ePDG and UE over SWu for the deactivated S2b bearer. Otherwise, the IKEv2 tunnel release is triggered from the ePDG if all bearers belonging to the PDN connection are released.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen the ePDG orders the deletion of the IPsec SA from UE to ePDG, using IKEv2 INFORMATIONAL exchange, the UE responds with deleting the IPsec SA from ePDG to the UE.\n3b.\tThe resources may be released in the non-3GPP IP access according to the conditions in step 3a.\n4.\tThe ePDG deletes the bearer contexts related to the Delete Bearer Request, and acknowledges the bearer deactivation to the PDN GW by sending a Delete Bearer Response (EPS Bearer Identity, User Location Information) message.\nThe User Location Information shall include UE local IP address and optionally UDP or TCP source port number (if NAT is detected). It may also include WLAN Location Information (and its Age) the ePDG may have received from the 3GPP AAA server about the UE. When the PDN GW receives no WLAN Location Information from the ePDG it shall delete any such information it may have stored for the PDN connection.\nNOTE:\tThe UE local IP address is the source address on the outer header of the IPsec tunnel to the ePDG.\n5.\tIn the case where the resources corresponding to the PDN connection are released in PDN GW, the PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN disconnection. If the UE no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP AAA Server notifies the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2.\n6.\tThe PDN GW deletes the bearer context related to the deactivated EPS bearer.

The procedure is depicted in a step-by-step manner, emphasizing the importance of GTP in facilitating the activation of the bearer and ensuring a smooth communication process.\nFigure 7.10-1: Dedicated S2b Bearer Activation Procedure with GTP on S2b\n1.\tIf dynamic PCC is deployed, the PCRF sends a PCC decision provision (QoS policy) message to the PDN GW.

If dynamic PCC is not deployed, the PDN GW may apply local QoS policy. The PCRF may also include a request to provide the User Location Info to the PDN GW.\n2.\tThe PDN GW uses this QoS policy to assign the EPS Bearer QoS, i.e., it assigns the values to the bearer level QoS parameters QCI, ARP, GBR and MBR. If this dedicated bearer is created as part of the handover from 3GPP access with GTP-based S5/S8, then the PDN GW applies the Charging ID already in use for the corresponding dedicated bearer while the UE was in 3GPP access (i.e. bearer with the same QCI and ARP as in 3GPP access). Otherwise, the PGW generates a new Charging Id for the dedicated bearer. The PDN GW sends a Create Bearer Request message (IMSI, EPS Bearer QoS, TFT, PDN GW Address for the user plane, PDN GW TEID of the user plane, Charging Id, LBI) to the ePDG.

The ePDG then stores the EPS Bearer Identity and links the dedicated bearer to the default bearer indicated by the Linked EPS Bearer Identity (LBI). The ePDG uses the uplink packet filter (UL TFT) and/or IPsec SA where applicable, to determine the mapping of uplink traffic flows to the S2b bearer. The ePDG then acknowledges the S2b bearer activation to the PGW by sending a Create Bearer Response (EPS Bearer Identity, ePDG Address for the user plane, ePDG TEID of the user plane, User Location Information) message.\nIf the ePDG has established a IPsec SA association with the UE for a dedicated S2b bearer, it shall maintain a binding between the IPsec SA and the EPS bearer ID.\nThe User Location Information shall include UE local IP address and optionally UDP or TCP source port number (if NAT is detected).

                    "text_content": "This clause describes the common aspects of handover for connectivity with multiple PDNs.\nThe support of multiple PDNs has the following impacts on the handover procedures for single PDN connectivity:\n-\tUpon handover from 3GPP access to non-3GPP access, and from non-3GPP access to 3GPP access, if the UE has multiple PDN connections to different APNs in the source access and the UE is capable of routing different simultaneously active PDN connections through different access networks, the UE may transfer from the source to the target access all the PDN connections that were active in source access before handover or only a subset of them, with the restriction that multiple PDN connections to the same APN shall be kept in one access.\n-\tUpon handover from 3GPP access to non-3GPP access, and from non-3GPP access to another non-3GPP access, using S2a or S2b, during the access authentication the HSS/AAA returns to the Trusted Non-3GPP Access or the ePDG the PDN GW identity and the associated APN for each PDN the UE is connected to. For non-3GPP accesses that support UE to establish connectivity to PDNs after attach, the UE performs an attach to the target non-3GPP access indicating that it is a handover, resulting in the UE being connected to one PDN, and the UE establishes connectivity with the remaining PDNs that are being transferred from the 3GPP system using the UE-initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN procedure.\n-\tIf the UE hands over between 3GPP access and a non-3GPP access and the UE has more than one PDN connection to a given APN in the source access and multiple PDN connections to a single APN are not supported via the target access, only one PDN connection to the given APN will be established in the target access. In this case, the following applies:\na)\tIf dynamic PCC is deployed and the PCRF receives a Gateway Control Session Establishment Request from the target BBERF indicating an IP-CAN type different from 3GPP access, the PCRF shall select one of the IP-CAN sessions for this APN and continue with the BBERF relocation procedure for that PDN connection.\nb)\tWhen the PDN GW receives a PBU over PMIP-based S2a or S2b or S5/S8, the PDN GW shall select one of the PDN connections for this APN and continue with the handover procedure for that PDN connection. The PDN GW shall terminate the remaining PDN connections for that APN without removing the PDN GW information in HSS. If dynamic PCC is deployed, the PDN GW informs the PCRF about the deactivated PDN connections using the PCEF initiated IP-CAN session termination procedure as described in TS 23.203 [19].\nc)\tWhenever the PDN GW receives a PBU containing an IPv6 prefix or an IPv4 address associated to one of the PDN connections and the IPv6 prefix or the IPv4 address is valid, the PDN GW shall use the IPv6 prefix or the IPv4 address to select the PDN connection out of the active PDN connections. When the information is not included in the PBU, the PDN GW and PCRF shall select the latest PDN connection out of the active PDN connections for the given APN (i.e. the PDN connection that was activated last out of the active PDN connections for the given APN).\nNOTE 1:\tThe UE may disconnect from certain PDN connections while still in the 3GPP access to ensure that there is only one PDN connection per APN when handing over to non-3GPP access.\n-\tIf the UE hands over between 3GPP access and a non-3GPP access and the UE has more than one PDN connection to a given APN in the source access and multiple PDN connections to a single APN is supported in the target access the following applies:\na)\tAll PDN connections to the same APN shall be handed over.\nb)\tWhen the PDN GW receives the request to establish a PDN connection to the given APN, the PDN GW shall select one of the PDN connections for this APN and continue with the handover procedure for that PDN connection.\nc)\tWhen S2c is used and it is bootstrapped before the handover to a foreigner link the home address identifies the PDN connection and the PDN GW shall select the PDN connection accordingly.\nNOTE 2:\tAs all PDN connections to a single APN are moved during a handover, the UE initiates the PDN connection re-establishment over the new access network for all of the PDN connections to the given APN. Therefore there is no need for the UE to indicate which of its PDN connections to the given APN is moved with a particular PDN connection establishment request. The UE learns which of its PDN connections is moved as a result of a PDN connection establishment request from the assigned IPv6 prefix/IPv4 address.\nNOTE 3:\tThere is no relation between the values of the PDN connection identities used over S2a/S2b and the EPS bearer identities used within 3GPP networks. If GTP is used on S2b, there is no relation between the values of the EPS bearer identities used within 3GPP networks and non-3GPP networks.\n-\tUpon handover from non-3GPP access to 3GPP access, if the MME has changed since the last detach or if there is no valid Subscriber context for the UE in the MME, or if the ME identity has changed, during the access authentication the HSS returns the Subscriber Data to the MME, including the PDN GW identity and the associated APN for each PDN the UE is connected to before the handover. The UE performs an attach to the 3GPP access with and indication for \"handover\" and then establishes connectivity with the remainder of PDNs that it was connected with over the non-3GPP system before the handover, using UE requested PDN connectivity specified in TS 23.401 [4]. The UE provides an indication of \"handover\" by providing Request Type indicating \"handover\" in the PDN connectivity request message as specified in TS 23.401 [4].\n-\tFor connectivity based on S2c:\n-\tUpon handover from 3GPP access to non-3GPP access, and from non-3GPP access to another non-3GPP access, the UE performs DSMIPv6 bootstrapping (if not yet performed) and binding procedures for each PDN connection that is being transferred from the source to the target access.\n-\tUpon handover from non-3GPP access, the UE de-registers the DSMIPv6 binding for each PDN connection that is being transferred from the source to the target access.\nNOTE 4:\tIf some IP traffic had been routed over WLAN as a result of 3GPP RAT mobility (e.g. from E-UTRAN to UTRAN), a UE can use an implementation-dependent hysteresis mechanism (e.g. based on an implementation dependent timer) to prevent the ping-pong such as traffic being handed back to the original RAT (e.g. E-UTRAN) again in a short period of time.\n",

                            "text_content": "The steps involved in the handover from a trusted or untrusted non-3GPP IP access to E-UTRAN connected to EPC are depicted below for both the non-roaming and roaming cases and when PMIPv6 is used on S2a or S2b. It is assumed that while the UE is served by the trusted or untrusted non-3GPP IP access, a PMIPv6 tunnel is established between the non-3GPP access network and the PDN GW in the EPC.\nFigure 8.2.1.1-1 illustrates the process of handover from a non-3GPP IP access network to an E-UTRAN network using PMIPv6 on S2a or S2b interfaces and GTP on S5/S8 interfaces. The figure depicts the transition from a trusted to an untrusted network, highlighting the role of the Home Location Register (HLR) and Visitor Location Register (VLR) in managing the handover process. The figure also shows the use of GTP tunneling for secure communication between the IP access network and the E-UTRAN network.\nFigure 8.2.1.1-1: Handover from Trusted or Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access to E-UTRAN with PMIPv6 on S2a or S2b and GTP on S5/S8 interfaces\nNOTE 1:\tAll steps outside of (A) and (B) are common for architecture variants with GTP-based S5/S8 and PMIP-based S5/S8. Procedure steps (A) and (B) for PMIP-based S5/S8 are described in clause 8.2.1.2.\nNOTE 2:\tAll steps inside of (C) are common for architecture variants with GTP-based S2b and PMIP-based S2b. Procedure for steps outside of (C) for GTP-based S2b are described in clause 8.6.1.1.\nIn case of connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:\n-\tIf the UE is connected to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access before the handover of PDN connections to 3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 16 shall be skipped and the UE shall only perform step 17 for each PDN connection that is being transferred from non-3GPP access.\n-\tIf the UE is connected only to non-3GPP access before the handover of PDN connections to 3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 16 shall be performed. In step 3 the UE should provide the APN corresponding to one of the PDN connections that are being transferred from non-3GPP access. If the APN is not provided, and the subscription context from HSS contains a PDN GW identity corresponding to the default APN, the MME shall use the PDN GW corresponding to the default APN as specified in TS 23.401 [4]. The UE shall then repeat step 17 for each of the remaining PDN connections that are being transferred from non-3GPP access.\n-\tStep 18 shall be repeated for each PDN connection that is being transferred from non-3GPP access.\nThe steps in 17 can occur in parallel for each PDN. Other impacts related to the handover for multiple PDNs are described in clause 8.1.\nThe optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway.\nBoth the roaming (Figure 4.2.1-2) and non-roaming (Figure 4.2.1-1) scenarios are depicted in the figure. In the roaming case, the vPCRF acts as an intermediary, sending the QoS Policy Rules Provision from the hPCRF in the HPLMN to the Serving GW in the VPLMN. The vPCRF receives the Acknowledgment from the Serving GW and forwards it to the hPCRF. In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at all.\nThe steps involved in the handover are discussed below.\n1)\tThe UE uses a trusted or untrusted non-3GPP access system and is being served by PDN GW (as PMIPv6 LMA).\n2)\tThe UE discovers the E-UTRAN access and determines to transfer its current sessions (i.e. handover) from the currently used non-3GPP access system to E-UTRAN. The mechanisms that aid the UE to discover the 3GPP Access system, are specified in clause 4.8 (Network Discovery and Selection).\n3)\tThe UE sends an Attach Request to the MME with Request Type indicating \"Handover\" Attach. The message from the UE is routed by E-UTRAN to the MME as specified in TS 23.401 [4] (E-UTRAN). The UE should include any one of the APNs, corresponding to the PDN connections in the source non-3GPP access. The APN is provided as specified in TS 23.401 [4].\n4)\tThe MME may contact the HSS and authenticate the UE as described in TS 23.401 [4].\n5)\tAfter successful authentication, the MME may perform location update procedure and subscriber data retrieval from the HSS as specified in TS 23.401 [4]. Since theRequest Type is \"Handover\", the PDN GW identity conveyed to the MME will be stored in PDN subscription context. The MME receives information on the PDNs the UE is connected to over the non-3GPP access in the Subscriber Data obtained from the HSS.\n6)\tThe MME selects an APN, a serving GW and PDN GW as described in TS 23.401 [4]. The MME sends a Create Session Request (including IMSI, MME Context ID (SGSN equivalent is TBD), PDN-GW address, Handover Indication, APN) message to the selected Serving GW. Since the Request Type is \"Handover\", a Handover Indication information is included.\n7) The Serving GW sends a Create Session Request (Handover Indication) message to the PDN-GW in the VPLMN or HPLMN as described in TS 23.401 [4]. Since the MME includes Handover Indication information in Create Session Request message, the Serving GW includes this information in Create Session Request message.\nSince Handover Indication is included, the PDN GW should not switch the tunnel from non-3GPP IP access to 3GPP access system at this point.\n8)\tSince Handover Indication is included, the PDN GW may execute a PCEF-Initiated IP CAN Session Modification Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19] to report e.g. change in IP-CAN type. If the UE had disconnected from the default PDN before handover then the PDN GW executes a PCEF initiated IP CAN Session Establishment procedures as described in TS 23.203 [19].\nSince Handover Indication is included in step 7, the PDN GW defers any modification to the PCC Rules (due to changes received from the PCRF, if there is PCRF interaction) and still applies the existing PCC Rules for charging and policy until step 13.\nDepending on the active PCC rules, the establishment of dedicated bearers for the UE may be required. The establishment of dedicated bearers in combination with the default takes place as described in Annex F of TS 23.401 [4].\nNOTE 3:\tDepending upon the support of the piggybacking feature in the network, the dedicated bearer can be created as part of default bearer establishment or immediately afterwards.\nNOTE 4:\tPDN GW address and Serving GW address selection is as described in the clause \"GW selection\" in TS 23.401 [4].\n9)\tThe PDN GW responds with a Create Session Response message to the Serving GW as described in TS 23.401 [4].The Create Session Response contains the IP address or the prefix that was assigned to the UE while it was connected to the non-3GPP IP access. It also contains the Charging Id previously assigned to the PDN connection in the non-3GPP access although the Charging Id still applies to the non-3GPP access.\n10)\tThe Serving GW returns a Create Session Response message to the MME as specified in TS 23.401 [4]. This message also includes the IP address of the UE. This message also serves as an indication to the MME that the S5 bearer setup and update has been successful. At this step the PMIPv6 or GTP tunnel(s) over S5 are established.\n11)\tRadio and Access bearers are established at this step in the 3GPP access as specified in TS 23.401 [4].\n12)\tThe MME sends a Modify Bearer Request (eNodeB address, eNodeB TEID, Handover Indication) message to the Serving GW.\n13)\tSince the Handover Indication is included in step 12), the Serving GW sends a Modify Bearer Request message to the PDN GW to prompt the PDN GW to tunnel packets from non 3GPP IP access to 3GPP access system and immediately start routing packets to the Serving GW for the default and any dedicated EPS bearers established.\nIn this step, the PDN GW applies any modification to the PCC Rules received from the PCRF, if there is PCRF interaction in step 8. The Charging Id previously in use for the PDN connection in the non-3GPP access now only applies to the default bearer in use in E-UTRAN access. If dedicated bearers are created, a new Charging Id is assigned by the PGW for each of them according to TS 23.401 [4].\nNOTE 5:\tSteps 13 and 14 are not performed if the PDNs are reconnected after handoff by the UE in step 17.\n14)\tThe PDN GW acknowledges by sending Modify Bearer Response to the Serving GW.\n15)\tThe Serving GW acknowledges by sending Modify Bearer Response (EPS Bearer Identity) message to the MME.\n16)\tThe UE sends and receives data at this point via the E-UTRAN system.\n17)\tFor connectivity to multiple PDNs, the UE establishes connectivity to each PDN that is being transferred from non-3GPP access, besides the PDN connection established in steps 3-15, by executing the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure specified in TS 23.401 [4].\n18)\tThe PDN GW shall initiate resource allocation deactivation procedure in the trusted/untrusted non-3GPP IP access as defined in clause 6.12 or clause 7.9.\nWhen a Trusted or Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access to 3GPP Access handover occurs, the following steps are performed instead of and in addition to the steps performed in the GTP-based S5/S8 case (see previous clause). In the case of PMIP-based S5/S8, a Create Session Request and Modify Bearer Request is not sent from the Serving GW to the PDN GW. Rather, the serving GW interacts with the hPCRF and PMIP messages are exchanged between the Serving GW and the PDN GW.\n\nFigure 8.2.1.2-1: Trusted/Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access to E-UTRAN Handover over PMIP-based S2a and using PMIP-based S5/S8\nIn case of connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:\nIn case of connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:\n-\tIf the UE is connected to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access before the handover of PDN connections to 3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 16 of Figure 8.2.1.1-1 shall be skipped and the UE shall only perform step 18 of Figure 8.2.1.2-1 for each PDN connection that is being transferred from non-3GPP access.\n-\tIf the UE is connected only to non-3GPP access before the handover of PDN connections to 3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 16 of Figure 8.2.1.1-1 shall be performed. In step 3 of Figure 8.2.1.1-1 the UE shall provide the APN corresponding to one of the PDN connections that are being transferred from non-3GPP access. The UE shall then repeat step 18 of Figure 8.2.1.2-1 for each of the remaining PDN connections that are being transferred from non-3GPP access.\n-\tStep 19 of Figure 8.2.1.2-1 shall be repeated for each PDN connection that is being transferred from non-3GPP access.\nThe steps in 18 of Figure 8.2.1.2-1 can occur in parallel for each PDN. Other impacts related to the handover for multiple PDNs are described in clause 8.1.\nThis procedure supports the home routed (Figure 4.2.2.1), roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1) and Local breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) case. The Serving GW establishes a Gateway Control Session with the PCRF in the HPLMN. In the case of the roaming or local breakout scenario, the Serving GW interacts with the hPCRF by way of the vPCRF. The signalling takes place through the vPCRF in the VPLMN. In the case of Local Breakout, the PDN GW in the VPLMN exchanges messages with the vPCRF. The vPCRF then exchanges messages with the hPCRF in the HPLMN.\nThe optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in Figure 8.2.1.2-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway.\nThe steps shown in (Alt A) and (Alt B) are mutually exclusive in this procedure, i.e. either steps A.2-A.5 are executed or steps B.1-B.3. In order to execute the alternative (Alt B), the IP Address(es) of the UE needs to be available after step A.1. The IP Address(es) of the UE is received in step A.1, if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. If multiple PDN connections to same APN are supported by the Serving GW, (Alt A) shall be used in this procedure.\nIn case the IP address(es) of the UE is available after step A1, (Alt B) provides lower jitter for dual radio handovers. In case the IP address(es) of the UE is not available after step A1, (Alt A) shall be used.\nA.1)\tThe Serving GW initiates a Gateway Control Session Establishment Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19] to obtain the rules required for the Serving GW to perform the bearer binding for all the active sessions the UE may establish as a result of the handover procedure.\nIf the updated QoS rules require establishment of dedicated bearer for the UE, the establishment of those bearers take place before step B1. The establishment of dedicated bearers in combination with the default takes place as described in Annex F of TS 23.401 [4].\nA.2)\tThe Serving GW sends a PMIPv6 Proxy Binding Update (MN NAI, Lifetime, Access Technology Type, Handover Indicator, IP Address Requested, APN, GRE Key for downlink traffic, Additional Parameters) message to the PDN GW. The MN NAI identifies the UE. The Lifetime field must be set to a non-zero value in the case of a registration. Access Technology Type is set to indicate 3GPP access to EPS. The Serving GW includes request for IPv4 Home Address and/or IPv6 Home Network Prefix as specified in step C.2 of clause 5.2. The APN may be necessary to differentiate the intended PDN from the other PDNs supported by the same PDN GW. The Serving GW includes the EPS bearer identity of the default bearer received from the MME if multiple PDN connections to the same APN are supported. The optional Additional Parameters may contain information, for example, protocol configuration options.\nA.3)\tThe PDN GW executes a PCEF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19] to obtain the rules required for the PDN GW to function as the PCEF for all the active IP sessions the UE has established with new IP-CAN type.\nA.4)\tThe PDN GW responds with a Proxy Binding Ack (MN NAI, Lifetime, UE Address Info, GRE key for uplink traffic, Charging ID, Additional Parameters) message to the Serving GW. The MN NAI is identical to the MN NAI sent in the Proxy Binding Update. The Lifetime indicates the duration the binding will remain valid. The UE address info returns the IP Address assigned to the UE. IP address allocation by the PDN-GW is as specified in clause 4.7.1. If the PDN GW sends the DHCPv4 Address Allocation Procedure Indication in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message, the UE IPv4 address assigned by the PDN GW is not provided as part of the default bearer activation procedures to the UE. In this case, the Serving GW does not forward the IPv4 address assigned by the PDN GW to the MME, but sets the PDN Address to 0.0.0.0 in the message to the MME. If the corresponding Proxy Binding Update contains the EPS bearer identity, the PDN GW shall acknowledge if multiple PDN connections to the given APN are supported. The optional Additional Parameter information element may contain other information, including for example Protocol Configuration Options. The Serving GW acts as the MAG (in terms of PMIPv6). Since this step is triggered by the Proxy Binding Update message from the Serving GW in step A.2, it can occur after step A.2 and does not need to wait for step A.3.\nThe Charging Id provided by the PGW is the Charging Id previously assigned to the PDN connection for the non-3GPP access.\nNOTE 1:\tPDN GW address selection is as described in TS 23.401 [4].\nNOTE 2:\tThe Serving GW learns from the PBA whether the PDN GW supports multiple PDN connection to the same APN or not.\nSteps between A and B.1 are described in clause 8.2.1.1.\nB.1-B.3)\tCorresponds to steps A.2 - A.4, respectively.\nSteps between B.1 and 18 are described in clause 8.2.1.1.\n18)\tFor connectivity to multiple PDNs, the UE establishes connectivity to each PDN that is being transferred from non-3GPP access, besides the PDN connection established in the steps above, by executing the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure specified in clause 5.6.1.\n19)\tThe PDN GW shall initiate resource allocation deactivation procedure in the trusted/untrusted non-3GPP IP access as defined in clause 6.12 or clause 7.9.\nThe steps involved in the handover from a trusted/untrusted non-3GPP IP access to UTRAN/GERAN connected to EPC are depicted below for both the non-roaming and roaming cases and when PMIPv6 is used on S2a or S2b. It is assumed that while the UE is served by the trusted/untrusted non-3GPP IP access, a PMIPv6 tunnel is established between the non-3GPP access network and the PDN GW in the EPC.\nNOTE 1:\tThis procedure is applicable to S4-SGSN only.\nFigure 8.2.1.3-1 illustrates the handover process from a trusted/untrusted non-3GPP IP access network to the UTRAN/GERAN system, utilizing PMIP on S2a and GTP-based S5/S8 protocols. The figure depicts the seamless transition of the user equipment (UE) from one network to another, ensuring minimal disruption to the user's experience. The diagram highlights the role of the home location register (HLR) and the visitor location register (VLR) in managing the UE's location and service continuity. The figure also emphasizes the importance of efficient handover procedures in maintaining high-quality communication and network performance.\nFigure 8.2.1.3-1: Handover from Trusted/untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access to UTRAN/GERAN with PMIP on S2a and GTP based S5/S8\nNOTE 2:\tAll steps outside of (A) and (B) are common for architecture variants with GTP based S5/S8 and PMIP based S5/S8. Procedure steps (A) and (B) for PMIP based S5/S8 are described in clause 8.2.1.4.\nNOTE 3:\tAll steps in (D) are common for architecture variants with GTP based S2b and PMIP based S2b. Procedures for steps outside of (D) for GTP based S2b are described in clause 8.6.1.2.\nIn case of connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:\n-\tIf the UE is connected to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access before the handover of PDN connections to 3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 6 shall be skipped.\n-\tIf the UE is connected only to non-3GPP access before the handover of PDN connections to 3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 6 shall be performed.\n-\tThe steps in (C) shall be repeated for each PDN connection that is being transferred from non-3GPP access.\nThe steps in (C) can occur in parallel for each PDN.\nThe steps involved in the handover are described below.\n1.\tThe UE uses a trusted/untrusted non-3GPP access system and is being served by PDN GW (as PMIPv6 LMA).\n2.\tThe UE discovers the 3GPP Access system (UTRAN or GERAN) and determines to transfer its current sessions (i.e. handover) from the currently used non-3GPP access system to the discovered 3GPP Access system. The mechanisms that aid the UE to discover the 3GPP Access system, are specified in clause 4.8 (Network Discovery and Selection).\n3.\tThe UE sends an Attach Request to the SGSN. The message from the UE is routed by 3GPP Access to the SGSN as specified in clause 6.5 of TS 23.060 [21].\n4.\tThe SGSN may contact the HSS and authenticate the UE as described in TS 23.060 [21].\n5.\tThe SGSN may perform location update procedure and subscriber data retrieval from the HSS as specified in TS 23.060 [21]. PDN GW identity information is part of the subscriber data.\n6.\tThe SGSN sends the Attach Accept request to the UE to indicate the completion of the attach procedure as defined in TS 23.060 [21].\n7.\tThe UE initiate at this stage this establishment of the primary PDP context as defined in clause 9.2.2 of TS 23.060 [21].\n8.\tThe SGSN selects a Serving GW as described in TS 23.060 [21] and sends Create Session Request (Handover indication, and other parameters described in TS 23.060 [21]) message to the selected Serving GW.\n9.\tThe Serving GW sends a Create Session Request message to the PDN-GW as described in TS 23.060 [21]. The PDN GW should not switch the tunnel from non-3GPP IP access to 3GPP access system at this point.\n10.\tThe PDN GW may execute a PCEF-Initiated IP CAN Session Modification Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19] to report e.g. change in IP-CAN type.\nSince the PDN GW does not switch the tunnel in step 9, it defers any modification to the PCC Rules (due to changes received from the PCRF, if there is PCRF interaction) and still applies the existing PCC Rules for charging and policy until step 14.\nDepending on the active PCC rules, the establishment of dedicated bearers for the UE may be required.\nNOTE 4:\tPDN GW address and Serving GW address selection is as described in the clause \"GW selection\" in TS 23.401 [4].\n11.\tThe PDN GW responds with a Create Session Response message to the Serving GW as described in TS 23.060 [21].The Create Session Response contains the IP address or the prefix that was assigned to the UE while it was connected to the non-3GPP IP access. It also contains the Charging Id previously assigned to the PDN connection in the non-3GPP access although the Charging Id still applies to the non-3GPP access.\n12.\tThe Serving GW returns a Create Session Response message to the SGSN as specified in TS 23.060 [21]. This message also includes the IP address of the UE. This message also serves as an indication to the SGSN that the S5 bearer setup and update has been successful.\n13.\tThe rest of the PDP context establishment as specified in TS 23.060 [21] is completed here.\nNOTE 5:\tThe S4-SGSN sends a Modify Bearer Request message to the Serving GW including the Handover Indication flag to inform Serving GW when PDP context establishment has been completed.\n14.The Serving GW sends a Modify Bearer Request message to the PDN GW in the VPLMN or the HPLMN including the Handover Indication flag that prompts the PDN GW to tunnel packets from non 3GPP IP access to 3GPP access system and immediately start routing packets to the Serving GW for the default and any dedicated EPS bearers established. In case of non-roaming or roaming with home routed traffic this message is sent to the PDN GW in the HPLMN. In case of local breakout traffic the message is sent to the PDN GW in the VPLMN.\nIn this step, the PDN GW applies any modification to the PCC Rules received from the PCRF, if there is PCRF interaction in step 10. The Charging Id previously in use for the PDN connection in the non-3GPP access now only applies to the default bearer in use in GERAN/UTRAN access. If dedicated bearers are created, a new Charging Id is assigned by the PGW for each of them according to TS 23.401 [4].\n15.\tThe PDN GW acknowledges by sending Modify Bearer Response to the Serving GW.\n16.\tThe UE sends and receives data at this point via the 3GPP access system.\n17.\tThe PDN GW shall initiate resource allocation deactivation procedure in the trusted/untrusted non-3GPP IP access as defined in clause 6.12 or clause 7.9.\nWhen a Trusted/untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access to UTRAN/GERAN handover occurs, the following steps are performed instead of and in addition to the steps performed in the GTP based S5/S8 case (see previous clause). In the case of PMIP based S5/S8, a Create Session Request and Modify Bearer Request is not sent from the Serving GW to the PDN GW. Rather, the serving GW interacts with the hPCRF and PMIP messages are exchanged between the Serving GW and the PDN GW.\nFigure 8.2.1.4-1 illustrates the trusted/untrusted non-3GPP IP access to GERAN/UTRAN over PMIP-based S2a and using PMIP-based S5/S8. The figure depicts the network architecture, including the GERAN/UTRAN, IP Access, and PMIP-based S2a and S5/S8 components. The diagram highlights the secure and non-secure communication paths, emphasizing the importance of network security in IP-based access to mobile networks.\nFigure 8.2.1.4-1: Trusted/untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access to GERAN/UTRAN over PMIP-based S2a and using PMIP-based S5/S8\nIn case of connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:\n-\tIf the UE is connected to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access before the handover of PDN connections to 3GPP access is triggered, the procedure as per Figure 8.2.1.3-1 before step 7 shall be skipped.\n-\tIf the UE is connected only to non-3GPP access before the handover of PDN connections to 3GPP access is triggered, the procedure as per Figure 8.2.1.3-1 before step 7 shall be performed.\n-\tThe steps in (C) shall be repeated for each PDN connection that is being transferred from non-3GPP access.\nThe steps in (C) can occur in parallel for each PDN.\nThis procedure supports the home routed (Figure 4.2.2-1), roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1) and Local breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) case. The Serving GW establishes a Gateway Control Session with the PCRF in the HPLMN. In the case of the roaming or local breakout scenario, the Serving GW interacts with the hPCRF by way of the vPCRF. The signalling takes place through the vPCRF in the VPLMN. In the case of Local Breakout, the PDN GW in the VPLMN exchanges messages with the vPCRF.

It is assumed that while the UE is served by the 3GPP Access, a PMIPv6 or GTP tunnel is established between the S-GW and the PDN GW in the evolved packet core.\nFigure 8.2.2-1 illustrates the process of handover from a 3GPP access network to a trusted non-3GPP IP access network using PMIPv6 on S2a and PMIPv6 or GTP on S5 interface. The figure depicts the transition from the 3GPP network to the non-3GPP network, highlighting the role of the Home Agent (HA) and the Mobility Management Entity (MME) in managing the handover process. The figure also shows the use of PMIPv6 and GTP protocols for maintaining connectivity and ensuring seamless handover between the two networks.\nFigure 8.2.2-1: Handover from 3GPP Access to Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access with PMIPv6 on S2a and PMIPv6 or GTP on S5 interface\nThis procedure supports the home routed (Figure 4.2.2.1), roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1) and Local breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) case.

Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway.\nFor connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:\n-\tIf the UE is connected to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access before the handover of PDN connections to trusted non-3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 10 shall be skipped and the UE shall only perform step 11 for each PDN connection that is being transferred from 3GPP access.\n-\tIf the UE is connected only to 3GPP access before the handover of PDN connections to trusted non-3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 10 shall be performed. In step 4 the UE shall provide an APN corresponding to one of the PDN connections that are being transferred from 3GPP access. The UE shall then repeat step 11 for each of the remaining PDN connections that are being transferred from 3GPP access.\n-\tStep 12 shall be repeated for each PDN connection that is being transferred from 3GPP access.\nStep 11 can occur in parallel for each PDN. Other impacts related to the handover for multiple PDNs are described in clause 8.1.\n1)\tThe UE is connected in the 3GPP Access and has a PMIPv6 or GTP tunnel on the S5 interface.\n2)\tThe UE discovers the trusted non-3GPP IP access system and determines to transfer its current sessions (i.e. handover) from the currently used 3GPP Access to the discovered trusted non-3GPP IP access system. The mechanisms that aid the UE to discover the trusted non-3GPP IP access system, are specified in clause 4.8 (Network Discovery and Selection).\n3)\tThe UE performs access authentication and authorization in the non-3GPP access system. The 3GPP AAA server authenticates and authorizes the UE for access in the trusted non-3GPP system. The 3GPP AAA server queries the HSS and returns the PDN-GW identity or identities to the trusted non-3GPP access system at this step (upon successful authentication and authorization). The 3GPP AAA Server also returns to the trusted non-3GPP access system the MN NAI to be used to identify the UE in Proxy Binding Update and Gateway Control Session Establishment messages (steps 5 and 6).\nPDN GW address selection is as described in clause 4.5.1 of this specification. The PDNs the UE is connected to before handover are obtained from the HSS with the UE subscriber data.\nNOTE 1:\tThe MN NAI returned from the 3GPP AAA Server to the trusted non-3GPP access system is a permanent IMSI based MN NAI.\n4)\tAfter successful authentication and authorization, the L3 attach procedure is triggered. At the latest, in this step, the UE should indicate its capability for the IP address preservation. How this information is signalled from the UE to the access network is outside of the scope of 3GPP.\nIf the UE provides an APN, the Trusted non-3GPP Access verifies that it is allowed by subscription. If the UE does not provide an APN, and the subscription context from HSS contains a PDN GW identity and APN pair corresponding to the default APN, the Trusted non-3GPP Access uses the default APN. The case where the APN selected for the handover attach (default APN or the APN provided by the UE) does not have corresponding PDN GW identity information in the subscription context is considered as an error case.\n5)\tThe Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access initiates a Gateway Control Session Establishment Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. If the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access supports UE/NW bearer control mode, the PCRF provides all the QoS rules required for the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access to perform the bearer binding.\nIf the updated rules require network-initiated dynamic resource allocation for the UE, the resource allocation takes place before step 6.\nIf the Handover Indicator in the Proxy Binding Update (to be sent in step 6) is set to indicate either initial attach or that the handover state is unknown, the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access indicates in the Gateway Control Session Establishment message that linking with the Gx session shall be deferred until step 7, as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. In this case, when performing the leg linking, the PCRF verifies that the IP-CAN type reported over Gxa and Gx are the same.\n6)\tThe entity in the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access acting as a MAG sends a Proxy Binding Update (MN-NAI, Lifetime, Access Technology Type, Handover Indicator, APN, GRE key for downlink traffic) message to the PDN GW in order to establish the new registration. The MN NAI identifies the UE for whom the message is being sent. The Lifetime field must be set to a nonzero value in the case of a registration. Access Technology Type is set to a value matching the characteristics of the non-3GPP access. The APN may be necessary to differentiate the intended PDN from the other PDNs supported by the same PDN GW. The MAG creates and includes a PDN connection identity if the MAG supports multiple PDN connections to a single APN.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen multiple PDN connections to a single APN are supported, the MN-ID, the APN and the PDN connection identity indentify the PDN connection within the Trusted Non-3GPP access network.\nNOTE 3:\tWhen the PDN GW receives the Proxy Binding Update and the the PS bearers corresponding to the PDN connection being handed over are suspended, then the PDN GW considers the bearers of the PDN connection being handed over as resumed and performs the handover.\n7A)\tThe PDN GW executes a PCEF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The Event Report indicates the change in Access Type.\nIf the PDN GW decided to allocate a new IP address/prefix instead of preserving the old IP address/prefix, as described in clause 4.1.3.2.3, the PDN GW executes an IP-CAN session Establishment Procedure with the PCRF instead of a PCEF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification Procedure.\n7B)\tThe PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of its PDN GW identity and the APN corresponding to the UE's PDN Connection and obtains authorization information from the 3GPP AAA Server. The message includes information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located. The 3GPP AAA Server may update the information registered in the HSS as described in clause 12.\n8)\tThe PDN GW responds with a PMIP Binding Acknowledgement (MN NAI, Lifetime, UE Address Info, Additional Parameters, GRE key for uplink traffic, Charging ID) message to the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access. The MN NAI is identical to the MN NAI sent in the Proxy Binding Update. The Lifetime indicates the duration the binding will remain valid. If the corresponding Proxy Binding Update contains a PDN connection identity, the PDN GW shall acknowledge if the PDN GW supports multiple PDN connections to a single APN. The UE address info returns the IP Address assigned to the UE. The optional Additional Parameter information element may contain other information. Since this step is triggered by the Proxy Binding Update message from the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access in step 6 and the result of the optional step 7, it can occur after step 7. If step 7 is not taken, this step can occur after step 6. The Charging Id provided is the Charging Id previously assigned to the PDN connection if the source access is a PMIP-based access or to the Default Bearer if the source access is GTP-based.\nNOTE 4:\tThe MAG learns from the PBA whether the PDN GW supports multiple PDN connection to the same APN or not.\n9)\tL3 attach procedure is completed at this point. The IP address(es) assigned to the UE by the PDN-GW is conveyed to the UE.\n10)\tThe PMIPv6 tunnel is set up between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the PDN GW. The UE can send/receive IP packets at this point.\n11)\tFor connectivity to multiple PDNs, the UE establishes connectivity to all the PDNs that are being transferred from 3GPP access besides the PDN connection that was established in the steps 3-10, as described in clause 6.8.1.\n12)\tThe PDN GW shall initiate the PDN GW Initiated PDN Disconnection procedure in 3GPP access as defined in clause 5.6.2.2 or the PDN GW Initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure as defined in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.4.4.1.\n",

PMIPv6/GTP is assumed to be used on the S5/S8 interface and PMIPv6 is used on the S2b interface.\nFigure 8.2.3-1 illustrates the process of handover from a 3GPP access network to an untrusted non-3GPP IP access network using PMIPv6 on S2b. The figure depicts the various stages of the handover process, including the initial connection to the 3GPP network, the transition to the non-3GPP network, and the final establishment of the connection on S2b. The figure also shows the role of the Home Agent (HA) and the Mobility Management Entity (MME) in facilitating the handover. The use of PMIPv6 ensures secure and efficient communication between the devices and the network, even in the presence of untrusted networks.\nFigure 8.2.3-1: Handover from 3GPP Access to Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access with PMIPv6 on S2b\nNOTE 1:\tFor GTP based S2b, procedure steps (A) to (D) are defined in clause 8.6.2.1.\nBoth the roaming (Figure 4.2.1-2) and non-roaming (Figure 4.2.1-1) scenarios are depicted in the figure. In the roaming case, the vPCRF acts as an intermediary, sending the QoS Policy Rules Provision from the hPCRF in the HPLMN to the Serving GW in the VPLMN. The vPCRF receives the Acknowledgment from the Serving GW and forwards it to the hPCRF. In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved.\nFor connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:\n-\tIf the UE is connected to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access before the handover of PDN connections to untrusted non-3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 9 shall be skipped and the UE shall only perform step 10 for each PDN connection that is being transferred from 3GPP access.\n-\tIf the UE is connected only to 3GPP access before the handover of PDN connections to untrusted non-3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 9 shall be performed.

The ePDG IP address to which the UE needs to form IPsec tunnel with is discovered as specified in clause 4.5.4. After the UE is authenticated, UE is also authorized for access to the APN. The procedure is as described in TS 33.402 [45]. As part of access authentication the PDN GW identity is sent to the ePDG by the 3GPP AAA server. If the UE supports IP address preservation during handover from 3GPP Access to the untrusted non-3GPP IP access, the UE shall include its address (IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix /address or both) allocated when it's attached to 3GPP Access into the CFG_Request sent to the ePDG during IKEv2 message exchange.\nWhen the 3GPP AAA server has WLAN Location Information about the UE, it provides it over SWm to the ePDG together with the Age of this information. The WLAN Location information is provided to the ePDG when the 3GPP AAA server considers that location information coming from the WLAN AN used by the UE is trustable.\n5)\tThe ePDG sends the Proxy Binding Update (MN-NAI, Lifetime, Access Technology Type, Handover Indicator, GRE key for downlink traffic, UE Address Info, Additional Parameter) message to the PDN GW. Access Technology Type is set to a value matching the characteristics of the non-3GPP access. The UE Address Info shall be set according to the CFG_Request in step 3. The ePDG shall not change the requested address(es) in the CFG_Request sent by the UE, and encode such address(es) in PBU and send to the PDN GW. If the UE included the address in step 3, the ePDG sets the handover indicator to indicate Handoff between two different interfaces of the UE. The APN is used by the PDN GW to determine which PDN to establish connectivity for, in the case that the PDN GW supports multiple PDN connectivity. The ePDG creates and includes a PDN connection identity if the ePDG supports multiple PDN connections to a single APN.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen multiple PDN connections to a single APN are supported, the MN-ID, the APN and the PDN connection identity indentify the PDN connection within the Untrusted Non-3GPP access network.\n6A)\tIf PCC is supported, the PDN GW requires configuration for enforcing policy, the PDN GW executes a PCEF-Initiated IP CAN Session Modification Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19].\n6B)\tThe PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of its PDN GW identity and the APN corresponding to the UE's PDN Connection and obtains authorization information from the 3GPP AAA Server. The message includes information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located. The 3GPP AAA Server may update the information registered in the HSS as described in clause 12.\n7)\tThe PDN GW processes the Proxy Binding Update message from the ePDG, updates the binding cache entry for the UE and responds with a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (MN_NAI, Lifetime, GRE key for uplink traffic, UE Address Info, Charging ID, Additional Parameters) message. In the Proxy Binding Ack, the PDN GW replies with the same IP address and/or prefix that was assigned to the UE earlier. If the corresponding Proxy Binding Update contains a PDN connection identity, the PDN GW shall acknowledge if the PDN GW supports multiple PDN connections to a single APN. At this point a PMIPv6 tunnel exists between PDN GW and ePDG. Since this step is triggered by the Proxy Binding Update message from the ePDG in step 4, it can occur after step 4 and does not need to wait for step 5. The Charging Id provided is the Charging Id previously assigned to the PDN connection if the source access is a PMIP-based access or to the Default Bearer if the source access is GTP-based.\nNOTE 3:\tThe ePDG learns from the PBA whether the PDN GW supports multiple PDN connection to the same APN or not.\nNOTE 4:\tWhen the PDN GW receives the Proxy Binding Update and the the PS bearers corresponding to the PDN connection being handed over are suspended, then the PDN GW considers the bearers of the PDN connection being handed over as resumed and performs the handover.\n8)\tThe ePDG and the UE continue the IKEv2 exchange and IP address configuration.\n9)\tAt the end of the handover procedure there is a default bearer for the UE that consists of an IPsec tunnel between the UE and the ePDG and a PMIPv6 tunnel between the ePDG and the PDN GW.\n10)\tFor connectivity to multiple PDNs, the UE establishes connectivity to each PDN that is being transferred from 3GPP access, besides the PDN connection that was established in the steps 3-8, by executing the UE-initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN procedure specified in clause 7.6.1.\n11)\tThe PDN GW shall initiate the PDN GW Initiated PDN Disconnection procedure in 3GPP access as defined in clause 5.6.2.2 or the PDN GW Initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure as defined in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.4.4.1.\n",

PDN connectivity is achieved through concatenated PMIPv6 tunnels between the trusted non-3GPP access or ePDG and the Serving GW, and between the Serving GW and the PDN GW.\n12)\tFor connectivity to multiple PDNs, the UE establishes connectivity to each PDN that is being transferred from 3GPP access, besides the PDN connection established in steps 2-11, by executing the UE-initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN procedure specified in clause 6.8.1.2, that applies to both trusted and untrusted non-3GPP accesses.\n13)\tIn case a new Serving GW has been selected during the attach on the non-3GPP access, the PDN GW triggers the bearer release in the 3GPP access using the PDN GW initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure. Otherwise, the Serving GW triggers the bearer release in the 3GPP Access using the Serving GW initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure. The 3GPP access resources associated with the PDN address are released if existing.\n",

The figure depicts the key components involved, including the home agent (HA), mobile node (MN), and the home and remote network servers (HSS and RSM). The handover is depicted as a seamless transition between the two networks, ensuring minimal disruption to the user's connectivity. The figure highlights the importance of efficient handover mechanisms in maintaining reliable communication in heterogeneous network environments.\nFigure 8.3-1: 3GPP IP Access to Non-3GPP IP access Handover over MIPv4-based S2a\nIn case of connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:\n-\tIf the UE is connected to both 3GPP access and trusted non-3GPP access before the handover of PDN connections to trusted non-3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 5 shall be skipped.\n-\tIf the UE is connected only to 3GPP access before the handover of PDN connections to trusted non-3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 5 shall be performed.\n-\tSteps 6 to 14 shall be repeated for each PDN connection that is being transferred from 3GPP access.\nStep 6 to step 14 can occur in parallel for each PDN. Other impacts related to the handover for multiple PDNs are described in clause 8.1.\nThe steps involved in the handover from 3GPP Access connected to the EPC to trusted non-3GPP IP access are depicted below for the case of non-roaming, roaming with home routed traffic, roaming with local breakout and roaming with anchoring in the Serving Gateway in the VPLMN. It is assumed that while the UE is served by the 3GPP Access, a PMIPv6 or GTP tunnel is established between the S-GW and the PDN GW in the evolved packet core.\nThe optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway.\nBoth the roaming (Figure 4.2.1-2) and non-roaming (Figure 4.2.1-1) scenarios are depicted in the figure. In the roaming case, the vPCRF acts as an intermediary, sending the QoS Policy Rules Provision from the hPCRF in the HPLMN to the Serving GW in the VPLMN. The vPCRF receives the Acknowledgment from the Serving GW and forwards it to the hPCRF. In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at all.\nThe event that triggers Authentication and Authorization in step 3 or step 6 between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA Server, or whether this step occurs at all, depends on the specific access technology.\n1)\tThe UE is connected in the 3GPP Access and has a PMIPv6 or GTP tunnel on the S5 interface.\n2)\tThe UE discovers the trusted non-3GPP IP access system and determines to transfer its current sessions (i.e. handover) from the currently used 3GPP Access to the discovered trusted non-3GPP IP access system. The mechanisms that aid the UE to discover the trusted non-3GPP IP access system, are specified in clause 4.8 (Network Discovery and Selection).\n3)\tThe UE performs access authentication and authorization in the non-3GPP access system as defined by TS 33.402 [45]. The 3GPP AAA server authenticates and authorizes the UE for access in the trusted non-3GPP system. As part of the authentication and authorization procedure, the 3GPP AAA server obtains the PDN-GW identity from the HSS and it returns the same PDN-GW identity to the trusted non-3GPP access system at this step (upon successful authentication and authorization).\n4)\tThe UE may send an Agent Solicitation (AS) RFC 5944 [12] message. Specification of this message is out of the scope of 3GPP.\n5)\tThe FA in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access sends a Foreign Agent Advertisement (FAA) (RFC 5944 [12]) message to the UE. The FAA message includes the Care-of Address (CoA) of the Foreign Agent function in the FA. Specification of this message is out of the scope of 3GPP.\n6)\tThe UE sends a Registration Request (RRQ) (MN-NAI, lifetime) message as defined in RFC 5944 [12] to the FA as specified in RFC 5944 [12]. Reverse Tunnelling shall be requested. This ensures that all traffic will go through the PDN GW. The RRQ message shall include the NAI-Extension RFC 2794 [34]. The UE may not indicate a specific Home Agent address in the RRQ message, in which case the FA uses the PDN GW address as received in step 3. The UE then receives the IP address of the PDN Gateway in step 11 as part of the RRP message. The UE should then include the PDN Gateway address in the Home Agent address field of subsequent RRQ messages.\n7)\tThe Trusted non-3GPP access initiates the Gateway Control Session Establishment Procedure with the PCRF. The Trusted non-3GPP access provides the information to the PCRF to correctly associate it with the IP-CAN session and also to convey subscription related parameters to the PCRF. If the Trusted Non-3GPP access supports UE/NW bearer control mode, the PCRF provides all the QoS rules required for the Trusted Non-3GPP access to perform the bearer binding.\n8)\tThe FA processes the message according to RFC 5944 [12] and forwards a corresponding RRQ (MN-NAI, lifetime) message to the PDN GW.\n9)\tThe PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of its PDN GW identity and the APN corresponding to the UE's PDN Connection and obtains authentication and authorization information from the 3GPP AAA Server. The message includes information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located. The 3GPP AAA Server may update the information registered in the HSS as described in clause 12.\n10)\tThe PDN GW allocates an IP address for the UE. The PDN GW initiates the IP CAN Session Modification Procedure with the PCRF, as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The PDN GW provides information to the PCRF that the IP-CAN type has changed and the PCRF responds to the PDN GW with PCC rules and event triggers.\nNOTE:\tWhen the PDN GW receives the RRQ and the the PS bearers corresponding to the PDN connection being handed over are suspended, then the PDN GW considers the bearers of the PDN connection being handed over as resumed and performs the handover.\n11)\tThe PDN GW sends a Registration Reply (RRP) (MN-NAI, Home Address, Home Agent Address) message as defined in RFC 5944 [12] to the FA.\n12)\tThe FA processes the RRP (MN-NAI, Home Address) according to RFC 5944 [12] and sends a corresponding RRP message to the UE.\n13)\tIP connectivity from the UE to the PDN GW is now setup. A MIP tunnel is established between the FA in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the PDN GW.\n14)\tThe PDN GW shall initiate the PDN GW Initiated PDN Disconnection procedure in 3GPP access as defined in clause 5.6.2.2 or the PDN GW Initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure as defined in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.4.4.1.\n",

Key components such as the S2c and 3GPP base stations, as well as the intermediate nodes, are clearly labeled.

In this case the PDN GW shall send a Binding Revocation Indication message to the UE.\nFollowing the de-registration of the DSMIPv6 binding due to reception of de-registration Binding update or due to triggering Binding Revocation, the PDN GW triggers PCEF initiated IP-CAN session modification, instead of doing it as part of the step 2, and performs path switch to forward downlink packets to the UE without any tunnelling (as the UE is on the home link).\n4)\tThis step occurs only if all PDN connections have handed over to the 3GPP access.

The IP address used by the UE as home address is not released by the UE and the PDN GW as a result of the deletion of such security associations if the UE remains connected to the PDN GW. This applies also to the scenario where the UE performed the initial attach over a 3GPP access and was given a IP address, bootstrapped the DSMIPv6 over the 3GPP access, performed an handover to the non-3GPP access using S2c, and is now performing an handover towards 3GPP access and therefore returning to the Home Link.\n",

The figure also shows how the S2c protocol is used to ensure seamless handover between different networks, providing a smooth and uninterrupted user experience.\nFigure 8.4.3-1: 3GPP Access to Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access with S2c (DSMIPv6) Handover\nIn case of connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:\n-\tIf the UE is connected to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access before the handover of PDN connections to untrusted non-3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 4 shall be skipped.\n-\tIf the UE is connected only to 3GPP access before the handover of PDN connections to untrusted non-3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 4 shall be performed.\n-\tSteps 6 to 10 shall be repeated for each PDN connection that is being transferred from 3GPP access. If not performed in 3GPP access prior to the handover, Step 5 shall also be repeated for each PDN connection that is being transferred from 3GPP access.\nOther impacts related to the handover for multiple PDN GWs are described in clause 8.1\n1.\tThe UE uses a 3GPP access system. It has an IP address that is supported over S5 interface, this IP address will be used as a HoA over the S2c reference point.\n2.\tAt this point the UE decides to initiate non-3GPP access procedure. The decision is based on any number of reasons e.g. local policies of the UE.\n3\tAccess authentication procedure between UE and the 3GPP EPC may be performed as defined by TS 33.402 [45].\n4.\tThe IKEv2 tunnel establishment procedure is started by the UE. The UE may indicate in a notification part of the IKEv2 authentication request that it supports MOBIKE. The ePDG IP address to which the UE needs to form IPsec tunnel is discovered via DNS query as specified in clause 4.5.4. After the UE is authenticated, UE is also authorized for access to the APN. The procedure is as described in TS 33.402 [45].\nNOTE 1:\tIt is assumed that the access system is aware that network-based mobility procedures do not need to be initiated.\n5.\tThe ePDG sends the final IKEv2 message with the assigned IP address in IKEv2 Configuration payloads. The IKEv2 procedure is completed and the IPSEC tunnel is set-up. In this procedure, the assigned IP address is an IPv4 address or an IPv6 prefix assigned to the UE by the ePDG and the assigned IP address that will be used as a Care-of Address for DSMIPv6 over the S2c reference point.\n6.\tIf bootstrapping was not performed prior to the handover defined here, the UE may discover PDN GW address using DSMIPv6 bootstrapping procedures defined in clause 4.5.2. If the PDN GW discovered by the UE upon MIPv6 bootstrapping is different from the PDN GW that was in use on the 3GPP access, a PDN GW reallocation as per steps 2-3 in clause 6.10 is performed. The target PDN GW that is communicated to the UE as part of the reallocation procedure must be exactly the PDN GW that was serving the UE while on the 3GPP access.\n7.\tThe UE sends a DSMIPv6 BU message to the PDN GW to register its CoA. The UE shall inform the PDN GW that the whole home prefix shall be moved.\n8.\tIf PCC is supported, the PDN GW executes a PCEF-Initiated IP CAN Session Modification Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19] to obtain the rules required for the PDN GW in the VPLMN or HPLMN to function as the PCEF for all the active sessions the UE has established with the new IP-CAN type as a result of the handover procedure.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen the PDN GW receives the Proxy Binding Update and the the PS bearers corresponding to the PDN connection being handed over are suspended, then the PDN GW considers the bearers of the PDN connection being handed over as resumed and performs the handover.\n9.\tThe PDN GW sends the DSMIPv6 Binding Ack to the UE. Since this step is triggered by the Binding Update message from the UE in step 6, it can occur after step 6 and does not need to wait for step 7.\nThe PDN GW may send message 8 before the procedure in step 8 is complete.\n10.\tThe UE continues with IP service using the same IP address in step 1.\n11.\tThe PDN GW shall initiate the PDN GW Initiated PDN Disconnection procedure in 3GPP access as defined in clause 5.6.2.2 or the PDN GW Initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure as defined in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.4.4.1.\n",

The figure depicts the seamless transition of mobile users from one network to another, ensuring uninterrupted connectivity.

The figure depicts the interaction between the home network, the service provider network, and the home network service center. The home network sends a registration request to the service provider network, which then forwards the request to the home network service center. The service center processes the request and sends a confirmation back to the home network. This process ensures that the home network is properly registered with the service provider and can access HRPD services.\nFigure 9.3.1-1: HRPD registration via LTE/SAE tunnel\n1.\tThe UE is registered with E-UTRAN/MME. It may have an ongoing data session established over EPS/E-UTRAN access.\n2.\tBased on a Radio Layer trigger (e.g., an indication from the E-UTRAN when the UE is in connected state or an indication over the broadcast channel), the UE decides to initiate a pre-registration procedure with potential target HRPD access. The pre-registration procedure allows the UE to establish and maintain a dormant session in the target HRPD access, while attached to the E-UTRAN/MME.\n3.\tRegistration to the HRPD is achieved by exchanging a series of HRPD messages between the UE and the HRPD Access Network. The HRPD signalling that is tunnelled transparently over the E-UTRAN and EPC creates an HRPD session context between the UE and the HRPD Access Network. The procedures described below are used in steps 3, 5, 8 and 9.\nThe UE generates an UL Information Transfer message (UL HRPD message). The UL HRPD message is transferred from the UE to the eNodeB as a parameter in the UL Information Transfer.\nThe eNodeB sends Uplink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling message (UL HRPD message, Sector ID) to the MME. The SectorID is statically configured in the eNodeB.\nThe MME selects an HRPD access node address. In order to be able to distinguish S101 signalling transactions belonging to different UEs, an S101 Session ID is used to identify signalling related to that UE on S101. The MME sends a Direct Transfer Request message (S101 Session ID, SectorID, UL HRPD message) to the HRPD access node. The MME determines the correct HRPD access node entity and address from the SectorID.\nNOTE 1:\tThere is an unambiguous mapping from the SectorID to the HRPD access node address.\nThe HRPD Access Network sends signalling in the DL direction to the MME using Direct Transfer Request message (S101 Session ID, DL HRPD message). The S101 Session ID is used to associate the signalling to a particular UE.\nThe MME sends the information on to the eNodeB using the Downlink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling message (DL HRPD message).\nThe eNodeB uses the DL information transfer message (DL HRPD message) to transport the signalling the UE.\nIf UE is handing over emergency sessions to HRPD access, the UE informs the HRPD access that it is an emergency handover. In case the UE is in limited service state and does not have an IMSI or its IMSI is unauthenticated, IMEI is used as a Session ID. If the IMSI is unauthenticated, the IMSI is also provided on the S101 tunnel to the HRPD access with an indication that it is unauthenticated.\n4.\tThe HRPD Access Network creates a signalling relationship with the HS-GW for the UE with interactions in HRPD network A10 / A11 interfaces.\nIf the HRPD Access Node is not configured to support emergency handovers, then it shall reject any handover request that indicates Emergency Handover.\n5.\tThe UE, HS-GW, and 3GPP AAA exchange EAP-AKA' signalling to authenticate the UE on the HRPD system. The HS-GW receives the APN(s) and PDN GW identity(es) information from AAA during authentication.\nIf the UE is performing an Emergency handover to HRPD access for emergency service and the HRPD access supports Emergency handover, the HPRD access skips the authentication procedure or the HRPD access accepts that the authentication may fail and continues the handover procedure. A statically configured PDN GW is selected by the HRPD access for the UE for unauthenticated UEs.\n6.\tThe HS-GW initiates a Gateway Control Session Establishment Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. If the HS-GW supports UE/NW bearer control mode, the PCRF provides the rules required for the HS-GW to perform the bearer binding for all the active sessions the UE may establish as a result of the handover procedure. For each PDN connection, if the UE has acquired an IPv6 prefix via the 3GPP access, the PCRF returns the IPv6 prefix of UE to the HSGW and the HSGW includes it in the TFT sent to the UE.\n7.\tThe UE and HS-GW exchange signalling to establish context to support the bearer traffic environment in use over the E-UTRAN.\n8.\tAt any time prior to the Handover Phase, if session maintenance activity is required, the UE or HRPD access network shall perform session maintenance signalling by tunnelling the HRPD session maintenance messages over the S101. If QoS parameters require updating, then this step includes the PCRF interaction. The MME uses the S101 Session ID to identify the UE context over the S101 interface.\nNOTE 2:\tBetween Step 7 and Step 8 the UE may enter ECM-IDLE state. To execute the session maintenance procedures at Step 8 it is necessary for the UE to enter ECM-CONNECTED state.\n9\tPCRF interactions due to session maintenance can be initiated by the PCRF or the HS-GW. The PCRF initiates the Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision Procedure specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The HS-GW initiates the Gateway Control and QoS Policy Rules Request Procedure as specified in TS 23.203 [19].\n",

The figure depicts the synchronization of the two networks, with the E-UTRAN network maintaining control of the user's connection until the HRPD network is fully established. Key components include the E-UTRAN eNodeB, the HRPD Serving Gateway, and the Mobility Management Entity (MME), which work together to ensure a smooth and efficient handover process. This figure is essential for understanding the complex interworking of different network layers in modern telecommunications systems.\nFigure 9.3.2-1: E-UTRAN to HRPD handover\n0.\tOngoing session established over EPS/E-UTRAN access.\n1.\tThe eNodeB receives measurement reports from the UE.\n2.\tThe eNodeB makes the handover decision.\n3.\tThe handover decision is signalled to the UE with Handover from E-UTRA preparation request message.\n4.\tUE sends an UL handover preparation transfer message (HRPD message starting HO access) to the eNodeB. The HRPD message starting HO access will be carried transparently to the HRPD access node, and its purpose is to request information for accessing an HRPD traffic channel. The message indicates to the eNodeB that the UE is responding to the Handover from E-UTRA preparation request message, and is requesting information for accessing an HRPD traffic channel.\n5.\tThe eNodeB sends the Uplink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling message (HRPD message starting HO access, and SectorID, CDMA2000 HO Required Indication) to the MME. The SectorID is statically configured in the eNodeB. The eNodeB will also include CDMA2000 HO Required Indication IE to Uplink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling message, which indicates to the MME that the handover preparation has started.\n6.\tWhen receiving Uplink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling message with CDMA2000 HO Required Indication the MME determines an HRPD access node address based on the SectorID. An S101 Session ID is used to identify signalling related to that UE on S101. The MME sends a Direct Transfer Request message (S101 Session ID, SectorID, PDN GW Identity(es), GRE key(s) for uplink traffic, APN(s), HRPD message starting HO access) to the HRPD access node.\nWhen GTP based S5/S8 is used in the EPS, the MME creates the uplink GRE keys from the uplink TEIDs of the default bearers using a standardized algorithm. In this way only one GRE key per PDN connection is created. The PDN GW shall be able to identify any PDN connection based on the GRE key created from the uplink TEID of the default bearer of that PDN connection.\nNOTE:\tWhen a PDN GW that supports both GTP and PMIP based interfaces allocates a TEID for a GTP tunnel, it also allocates and memorizes a corresponding GRE key if the tunnel is created for a default bearer. Later the PDN GW is able to identify the PDN connection based on the corresponding GRE key, i.e. the PDN GW also assigns the corresponding GRE key to that particular PDN connection and it cannot use that GRE key for any other PDN connection.\n7.\tThe HRPD access network allocates the requested radio access resources, and requests a forwarding address from HS-GW. The information sent in the request from the HRPD access network to HS-GW includes APN(s), PDN GW Identity(es) and GRE key(s) for uplink traffic. The response includes the HS-GW Address and GRE key(s) for forwarded traffic on S103. There is one GRE key for each PDN connection for which traffic is to be forwarded.\n8.\tThe HRPD access network sends the Direct Transfer Request message (S101 Session ID, HRPD message with HO access information, HS-GW Address and GRE key(s) for forwarded traffic, CDMA2000 HO Status) to the MME. The HS-GW Address and GRE key(s) for forwarded traffic are sent if data forwarding applies. If the HRPD access network did not allocate the resources as requested, this will be indicated to the MME and eNodeB with the CDMA2000 HO Status IE, and the embedded HRPD message indicates the failure to the UE.\n9a.\tIf Direct Transfer Request message included HS-GW Address and GRE key(s) for forwarded traffic, the MME determines which of the S1-U bearers should be forwarded to the HRPD and configures resources for indirect data forwarding by sending Create Forwarding Tunnel Request (HS-GW address, GRE key(s) for forwarded traffic, EPS bearer ID(s) subject to forwarding) to the Serving GW.\nThe MME shall select the same Serving GW which is used as the anchor point for the UE to perform the data forwarding.\n9b.\tThe Serving GW confirms data forwarding resources for S103 and allocates forwarding address for S1 in Create Forwarding Tunnel Response (cause, S-GW address, S1-U uplink TEID(s)). The S1-U uplink TEIDs are provided one per S1-U bearers subject to forwarding.\n10.\tThe MME sends the Downlink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling message (HRPD message with HO access information, S-GW address, S1-U uplink TEID(s), CDMA2000 HO Status) to the E-UTRAN. If the CDMA2000 HO Status indicates that handover preparation failed, the Downlink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling message will be sent with appropriate cause, and the embedded HRPD message that indicates the failure to the UE. The message from the MME provides the eNodeB also with the data forwarding S1-U uplink TEIDs allocated at the Serving GW if data forwarding applies.\n11.\tThe E-UTRAN forwards the HRPD message with HO access information to the UE in Mobility from E-UTRA message. This is perceived by the UE as a Handover Command message. If handover preparation failed, DL Information transfer message will be sent instead, with the embedded HRPD message that indicates the failure to the UE.\nIf data forwarding applies, the E-UTRAN starts forwarding received downlink data to the S-GW on a per-S1-U bearer forwarding tunnel, which then forwards these packets on a per-PDN per-UE S103 tunnel to the HS-GW. The forwarding starts at the same moment as the Mobility from E-UTRA message is sent to the UE.\n12.\tThe UE retunes to the HRPD radio access network and performs traffic channel acquisition.\n13.\tThe UE sends an HRPD Traffic Channel Complete (TCC) message to the HRPD access network.\n14a-f\tThe E-UTRAN triggers switching the flow in the EPC with the following sequence:\n14a.\tThe HRPD access network sends A11 request signalling to HS-GW to start setting up the U-Plane connection between the HRPD access network and HS-GW.\n14b.\tThe HS-GW sends Proxy Binding Update to PDN GW. The HS-GW sends the all zero IPv4 Home Address (0.0.0.0) or all zero IPv6 Home Prefix (0::/0) in the PBU message. In order to support session continuity, the P-GW performs the Binding Cache entry existence test based on the NAI and assigns the same IPv4 Home Address and/or IPv6 Home Prefix to the UE and acknowledge in the PBA message.\n14c.\tThe PDN GW switches the flow from Serving GW to HS-GW, and sends Proxy Binding Acknowledge to HS-GW, including the Charging ID for the PDN connection.\n14d.\tThe HS-GW responses with A11 response signalling to the HRPD access network.\n14e.\tThe PDN GW executes a PCEF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19] to obtain the rules required for the PDN GW to function as the PCEF for all the active IP sessions the UE has established with new IP-CAN type. Otherwise, information configured with the P-GW may be used to determine policy. Since Steps 14c and 14e are both triggered by the Proxy Binding Update in Step 14b, Steps 14c and 14e may occur in parallel.\n14f.\tThe PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of its PDN GW identity and the APN corresponding to the UE's PDN Connection and obtains authorization information from the 3GPP AAA Server. The message includes information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located.

For emergency services, the 3GPP AAA server may update the HSS with the PDN GW currently in use for emergency services. This procedure only occurs when the 3GPP AAA Server has in turn successfully received the PDN GW identity and APN (or the PDN GW currently in use for emergency services in case of emergency services) from the PDN GW the UE is attached to. The 3GPP AAA server should subsequently always update the HSS with the PDN GW identity in the above-mentioned manner. This procedure is used for PDN GW registration.\nFigure 12.1.4-1 illustrates the process of PDN Gateway (PGW) address notification in a telecommunication network.

For each PDN connection, the S2c IKEv2 SA establishment has to be performed separately.\nFigure 15.1-1 illustrates the process of S2c PDN Attach via DSMIPv6 home link, which involves the attachment of a service to a PDN (Packet Data Network) using DSM (Device Service Model) IPv6 protocol. The figure depicts the various components involved, including the home agent, home agent service, and the PDN. The home agent is responsible for managing the home link, while the home agent service handles the communication between the home agent and the PDN. The PDN, represented by the PDN service, is responsible for providing the necessary connectivity for the service. The figure also shows the various interfaces involved in the process, such as the home agent interface and the PDN service interface. Overall, the figure provides a clear overview of the process of S2c PDN Attach via DSMIPv6 home link, highlighting the key components and interfaces involved.\nFigure 15.1-1: S2c PDN Attach via DSMIPv6 home link\n0.\tIn this procedure it is assumed that UE is already attached to the PDN over the 3GPP access system as defined in TS 23.401 [4]. This step, according to TS 23.401 [4] could be an initial attach to a default PDN or a UE initiated subsequent attach to another PDN.\n1.\tThe UE discovers the PDN GW providing access to the PDN it connected to in Step 0, as defined in the clause 4.5.2. To ensure reachability of the PDN GW, signalling associated with this step as well as step 2 below, should be performed over the connection established by step 0 above.\n2.\tA security association is established between the UE and PDN GW to secure the DSMIPv6 messages related to this PDN connection between the UE and the PDN GW.\nThe UE initiates the establishment of the security association using IKEv2, RFC 5996 [9]; EAP, RFC 3748 [11] is used over IKEv2 for authentication purposes. The PDN GW communicates with the AAA infrastructure in order to complete the authentication.\nDuring this step an IPv6 home prefix is assigned by the PDN GW to the UE as defined in RFC 4877 [22]. During this step the UE shall include the IPv6 Home Address and may include the APN of the PDN it wants to access. The PDN GW address and APN associated with the UE's PDN Connectivity are registered by the AAA server with the HSS as described in clause 12.\nIn this step, the PDN GW may be either in the HPLMN or in the VPLMN. When the PDN GW is in the VPLMN, the interaction between the PDN GW in the VPLMN with the AAA/HSS in the HPLMN may involve a 3GPP AAA Proxy in the VPLMN.\n3.\tUE confirms that it is located in its DSMIPv6 home link for the given PDN, as described for DSMIPv6 Home Link Detection Function in clause 4.5.6.\nIn some cases this procedure may result in a PDN GW that is different than the one the UE is connected to in step 0. In this case the PDN GW reallocation procedure defined in clause 6.10 is applied.\n",

The figure depicts the various components involved, including the WLAN access points, the EPC, and the authentication and authorization servers. The architecture ensures secure and reliable access to the EPC network while maintaining user mobility. The figure highlights the role of the Access and Mobility Management Entity (AMME) in managing user sessions and maintaining connectivity during transitions between different access points. The use of the WLAN for access to the EPC is shown to be a more secure alternative to traditional mobile networks, as it bypasses the need for roaming agreements and associated security risks.\nFigure 16.1.1-1: Non-roaming architecture for Trusted WLAN access to EPC\nFigure 16.1.1-2 illustrates the roaming architecture for Trusted WLAN access to the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) in a Home Routed scenario. In this setup, the Home VPLMN (Visitor Public Land Mobile Network) provides WLAN service to the user equipment (UE). The figure depicts the interaction between the WLAN and EPC domains, highlighting the role of the Home VPLMN, the Visitor VPLMN, and the Home Roaming Gateway (HRGW) in facilitating seamless roaming and service continuity for the user.

Nevertheless, the procedures specified in the subsequent sections assume the following functions in the TWAN:\n-\tA WLAN Access Network (WLAN AN). WLAN AN includes a collection of one or more WLAN access points. An access point terminates the UE's WLAN IEEE 802.11 link defined in IEEE Std 802.11-2012 [64].\n-\tA Trusted WLAN Access Gateway (TWAG). This function terminates S2a.\n-\tWhen the TWAN provides access to EPC in Transparent Single-Connection mode or in Single-Connection mode, it forwards packets between the UE-TWAG point-to-point link and the S2a tunnel for that UE. The association in the TWAN between UE-TWAG point-to-point link and S2a tunnel is based on the UE MAC address.\n-\tWhen the TWAN provides access to EPC in Multi-Connection mode, it forwards user plane packets between the UE-TWAG point-to-point link corresponding to a specific WLCP bearerand the associated S2a tunnel for that UE. The UE's MAC address and a TWAG's MAC address that is assigned for a specific WLCP bearer are used to identify the point-to-point link between the UE and its serving TWAG, which corresponds to the S2a tunnel for the associated WLCP bearer.\n-\tWhen the TWAN provides access to EPC in Multi-Connection mode, the WLCP signalling is used between the UE and the TWAG.\n-\tA Trusted WLAN AAA Proxy (TWAP). This function terminates STa. It relays the AAA information between the WLAN Access Network and the 3GPP AAA Server or Proxy in case of roaming. It establishes the binding of UE subscription data (including IMSI) with UE MAC address on the WLAN Access Network. If L2 attach triggers are used, it informs the TWAG of L2 attach events. It is aware of UE L2 Detach from the WLAN Access Network and informs the TWAG of L2 Detach events. It provides the TWAG with UE subscription data during initial attach or at UE subscription data modification.\nFigure 16.1.2-1 illustrates the functional split of a trusted WLAN access network, highlighting the separation of access control and user data processing. The figure depicts the network infrastructure, including access points (APs), authentication servers, and user data servers. The access control function is centralized, ensuring secure authentication and authorization, while the user data processing is decentralized to provide efficient data handling. The figure emphasizes the importance of a secure and efficient network architecture for wireless access.\nFigure 16.1.2-1: Trusted WLAN Access Network functional split\nA per-UE point-to-point link between the UE and the TWAG is required when traffic for that UE is routed via S2a. Additionally, in Multi-Connection mode, one point-to-point link between an UE and its serving TWAG is required for transporting user plane traffic for every PDN connection or S2a bearer. The UE's MAC address and an associated TWAG's MAC address are used to identify the point-to-point link between the UE and its serving TWAG that is associated to a specific PDN connection or S2a bearer. In particular it is assumed that the WLAN AN enforces upstream and downstream forced-forwarding between the UE's WLAN IEEE 802.11 association and the TWAG. The aspects of point-to-point link described in RFC 5213 [8] and RFC 5844 [17] also apply to the point-to-point link between UE and TWAG. The implementation of the point-to-point link, including how and when it is setup, is out-of-scope of 3GPP.\nNOTE 1:\tIn TSCM from the UE's perspective the SWw reference point appears as a shared medium / link as any other IEEE 802.11 WLAN and thus the UE can use the subnet prefix / mask and the default GW address for its packet routing decisions. The point-to-point nature of the link is realized by the TWAN enforcing that packets sent from, and received by the UE are respectively forwarded to, and forwarded by the TWAG.\nIn SCM and MCM from the UE's perspective an EPC routed PDN connection over the SWw reference point appears as a point-to-point link similar to how it is in 3GPP access. Shared link parameters such as netmask and default router IP address are not used in these modes.\nNOTE 2:\tGxa interface is not used for S2a-PMIP in Trusted WLAN within this Release of the specification. No policy interworking solution based on S9a is defined for Fixed Broadband access interworking via S2a within this Release of the specification.\nNOTE 3:\tWhether multiple TWAN functions are mapped to a single entity, or a single TWAN function is distributed among multiple entities is out-of-scope of 3GPP.\nIn order to support EPC access through S2a over Trusted WLAN the following functions shall be supported by the UE:\n-\tWLAN specifications as per IEEE Std. 802.11-2012 [64].\n-\t3GPP-based network access authentication with EPC over WLAN as defined in clause 4.9.1, using IEEE Std 802.1X-2004 [65].\n-\tIPv4 and/or IPv6 support:\n-\tFor IPv4: IETF RFC 791 [66], IETF RFC 2131 [28]\n-\tFor IPv6: IETF RFC 2460 [67], IETF RFC 4861 [38], and IETF RFC 4862 [58]\nThree different modes of operation are distinguished: Transparent Single-Connection mode, Single-Connection mode and Multi-Connection mode. The UE and the network negotiate the mode of operation as part of the authentication procedure based on extensions to the EAP-AKA', (IETF RFC 5448 [72]) signaling between the UE and the network.\nThe Single-Connection mode only supports NSWO or a single PDN connection at a given time over a Trusted WLAN. On the other hand, the Multi-Connection mode supports simultaneous one or more PDN connections and/or NSWO over Trusted WLAN. Multi-Connection mode for GTP based S2a supports multiple WLCP bearers between UE and TWAG. Both Single-Connection mode and Multi-Connection modes support IP address preservation between 3GPP and Trusted WLAN access and PDN connectivity to a non-default APN.\nThe Single-Connection mode does not require additional protocols than EAP-AKA' in order to establish NSWO or PDN connectivity.\nThe multi connection mode uses a specific protocol (WLCP, specified in clause 16.1.4A3.1) after the access authentication procedure to trigger PDN connection establishment / release.\nThe negotiation of connection mode is further detailed in clause 16.4.A.1.\nIn Transparent Single-Connection mode, handover-indicator from the UE, APN indication from the UE and PCO via WLAN are not supported. As a consequence the following features are not supported: handover between TWAN and 3GPP access with IP address preservation; connectivity to a non-default APN; UE initiated connectivity to additional PDN.\nWhen the TWAN supports emergency services, it shall be configured with emergency configuration data as defined in clause 4.5.7.2.1. The TWAN notifies the UE whether it supports emergency services by sending a related indication to the 3GPP AAA server, which relays this information in EAP signalling sent to the UE.\n",

                            "text_content": "In this Release of the specification, deferred IPv4 address allocation is not supported.\nWhen using Single-connection mode and Multi-connection mode, the UE sees the PDN Connection as a point-to-point link similar to how it is in 3GPP access. Shared link parameters such as netmask and default router IP address are not used.\nIn Transparent Single-connection Mode, TWAG shall act as DHCPv4/v6 server for the UE.\nIn Single-connection mode and Multi-connection mode, the link model is described below:\n-\tTo support IPv4 connectivity, the IPv4 address shall be allocated and sent to the UE during PDN connection establishment.\n-\tTo support IPv6 connectivity, the PGW handles the RS/RA messages in GTP-based S2a scenario, while the TWAG handles the RS/RA messages in PMIP-based S2a scenario.\n-\tTo support IPv6 parameter configuration UE may use stateless DHCPv6. The PGW acts as DHCPv6 server. With PMIP-based S2a the TWAG may act as DHCPv6 relay.\nIn order to enable IPv4 connectivity the TWAN shall support DHCPv4 server functionality for IPv4 parameter configuration and IP address allocation as specified in RFC 2131 [28] and RFC 4039 [29]. For this case the following applies:\n-\tIf the PDN type in the user subscribtion data is IPv4 or IPv4v6, the TWAN requests IPv4 address in the Proxy Binding Update or GTP Create Session Request from the PDN GW. The IPv4 address is delivered to the TWAN during the PMIPv6 or GTP tunnel establishement. When the UE requests the IPv4 address via DHCPv4, the TWAN delivers the received IPv4 address to the UE within DHCPv4 signalling after the PMIPv6 or GTP tunnel is established between the TWAN and the PDN GW.\nNOTE 1:\tAs a consequence the PDN GW configuration for the default APN used via Trusted WLAN access cannot dictate the use of deferred IPv4 address allocation.\nNOTE 2:\tAfter releasing the IPv4 address using DHCPv4 Release procedure, the UE may subsequently request an IPv4 address for the same PDN connection. If the PDN connection is not released at this point of time, a subsequent IPv4 address request by the UE will result in the allocation of the same IP address, as the IPv4 address assigned to the UE has not been released in the PDN GW and TWAN.\nIn order to enable IPv6 the TWAN shall support of prefix advertisement for IPv6 prefix received from PDN GW in PMIPv6 Proxy Binding Acknowledgement or in the GTP Create Session Response. Moreover the TWAN may support DHCPv6 server functionality for IPv6 parameter configuration as specified in RFC 3736 [30]. This functionality is required to support DHCPv6 based parameter configuration mechanism in the UE. The TWAN may also support IPv6 RA options for DNS configuration accorduing to RFC 6106 [68].\nNOTE 3:\tConfiguration parameters are received from the PDN GW within PMIPv6 PBA message or within GTP Create Session Response message.\nAfter the PDN GW releases the IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix, the PDN GW should not assign the same IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix to another UE immediately.\nIn case of static IP address allocation, the TWAN may receive a static IP address (i.e. a static IPv4 address and/or a static IPv6 prefix) from HSS/AAA during access authentication and authorization procedure. Then the TWAN should forward the static IP address to the PDN GW during the tunnel establishment request (in PBU or in Create Session Request message).\nSimilar mechanism as described in TS 23.401 [4] clause 5.3.1.1 is used to decide the PDN type, with the following exceptions:\n-\tThe UE indicates the requested PDN type during EAP authentication procedure.\n-\tThe TWAG selects the PDN type according to the subscription data in the same way as the MME selects it when 3GPP access is used, as described in TS 23.401 [4].\n-\tIf the requested PDN type is IPv4v6, and both IPv4 and IPv6 PDN types are allowed by subscription but not IPv4v6, the TWAG shall set the PDN type to IPv4 or IPv6 where the selection between IPv4 and IPv6 is implementation specific. Then the UE shall not initiate the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure to this APN in order to activate a second PDN connection with the other single address PDN type.\nIf the PDN Type associated with the PDN connection is IPv4:\n-\tThe PDN GW shall allocate and send the IPv4 address to the TWAG in the Create Session Response or Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message. The IPv4 address received from the PDN GW is provided to the UE during the EAP authentication procedure. The PDN GW also sends IPv4 configuration parameters to the UE via PCO.\nIf the PDN Type associated with the PDN connection is IPv6:\n-\tWith GTP-based S2a, the PDN GW shall allocate and send the IPv6 network prefix to the UE in RA message. Because any prefix that the PDN GW will advertise to the UE is unique, there is no need for the UE to perform Duplicate Address Detection for global uniqueness for any IPv6 address configured from the allocated IPv6 network prefix. However, the PDN GW shall respond with Neighbor Advertisement upon receiving Neighbor Solicitation messages from a given UE. For example, the UE may perform Neighbor Unreachability Detection towards the PGW, the PGW supports the DAD related functionality as described in TS 23.401 [4]. Moreover, to ensure that link-local address generated by the UE does not collide with the link-local address of the PGW, the PDN GW shall provide an interface identifier to the UE and the UE shall use this interface identifier to configure its link-local address.\n-\tWith PMIP-based S2a, the PDN GW shall allocate and send the IPv6 network prefix to the TWAG in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement. The TWAG sends it to the UE in RA message. Because any prefix that the TWAG will advertise to the UE is unique, there is no need for the UE to perform Duplicate Address Detection for global uniqueness for any IPv6 address configured from the allocated IPv6 network prefix. However, TWAG shall respond with Neighbor Advertisement upon receiving Neighbor Solicitation messages from a given UE, similar to that supported by PGW in the case of GTP based S5/S8 described in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.3.1.2.2. Otherwise the PGW has the same functions as it is defined in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.3.1.2.2. Moreover, to ensure that link-local address generated by the UE does not collide with the link-local address of the TWAG, the PDN GW shall provide an interface identifier to the UE and the UE shall use this interface identifier to configure its link-local address. The PDN GW shall also provide a link-local address to the TWAG and the TWAG shall use the link-local address on the access link shared with the UE.\n-\tThe PGW may support DHCPv6 server functionality for IPv6 parameter configuration as specified in RFC 3736 [30]. When the UE requests IPv6 parameter configuration via DHCPv6 procedure, the TWAG delivers DHCPv6 signallings between the UE and the PGW as a DHCPv6 relay in PMIP-based S2a scenario.\nIf the PDN type associated with the PDN connection is IPv4v6:\n-\tThe TWAG shall request both IPv6 network prefix and IPv4 address in the Create Session Request or Proxy Binding Update message.\n-\tThe IPv4 address allocation and IPv4 parameter configuration are the same as for PDN type IPv4 defined in previous bullets.\n-\tThe IPv6 network prefix allocation via IPv6 Stateless Address auto-configuration procedure and IPv6 parameter configuration via Stateless DHCPv6 procedure are the same as for PDN type IPv6 defined in previous bullets.\nAfter the PDN GW releases the IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix, the PDN GW should not assign the same IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix to another UE immediately.\nIn case of static IP address allocation, the TWAG may receive a static IP address (i.e. a static IPv4 address and/or a static IPv6 prefix) from HSS/AAA during access authentication and authorization procedure. Then the TWAG should forward the static IP address to the PDN GW during the tunnel establishment request (in PBU or in Create Session Request message).\nSimilar mechanism as described in TS 23.401 [4] clause 5.3.1.1 is used to decide the PDN type, with the following exceptions:\n-\tThe UE indicates the request PDN type in WLCP signalling.\n-\tThe TWAG selects the the PDN type according to the subscription data received from the HSS/AAA in the same way as the MME selects it when 3GPP access is used, as described in TS 23.401 [4].\nIf the PDN Type associated with the PDN connection is IPv4:\n-\tThe PDN GW shall allocate and send the IPv4 address to the TWAG in the Create Session Response or Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message. The TWAG shall send the IPv4 address received from the PDN GW to the UE in WLCP message. The PDN GW also sends IPv4 configuration parameters to the UE via PCO.\nIf the PDN Type associated with the PDN connection is IPv6:\n-\tThe same considerations as above for PDN type IPv6 in single connection mode apply.\nIf the PDN type associated with the PDN connection is IPv4v6:\n-\tThe TWAG shall request both IPv6 network prefix and IPv4 address in the Create Session Request or Proxy Binding Update message.\n-\tThe IPv4 address allocation and IPv4 parameter configuration are the same as for PDN type IPv4 defined in previous bullets.\n-\tThe IPv6 network prefix allocation via IPv6 Stateless Address auto-configuration procedure and IPv6 parameter configuration via Stateless DHCPv6 procedure are the same as for PDN type IPv6 defined in previous bullets.\nAfter the PDN GW releases the IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix, the PDN GW should not assign the same IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix to another UE immediately.\nIn case of static IP address allocation, the TWAG may receive a static IP address (i.e. a static IPv4 address and/or a static IPv6 prefix) from HSS/AAA during access authentication and authorization procedure. Then the TWAG should forward the static IP address to the PDN GW during the tunnel establishment request (in PBU or in Create Session Request message).\n",

                            "text_content": "Two scenarios are supported. In one scenario, a single point-to-point connectivity between the UE and the TWAG is used to transport traffic for the default and all S2a bearer(s). This is described in clause 16.1.6.1. In the second scenario, a separate WLCP bearer is established for the default S2a bearer, and for each dedicated S2a bearer established on the S2a interface. This scenario applies when both the UE and the TWAN supports the establishment of multiple WLCP bearers. This is described in clause 16.1.6.2\nFigure 16.1.6.1 -1 illustrates a network configuration where two unicast S2a bearer connections are mapped into a single point-to-point connection using GTP-based S2a. This configuration is depicted through a series of interconnected nodes, including the SGW, P-GW, and eNodeB, which are essential components of the 3GPP LTE network. The figure highlights the efficient use of resources and the ability to manage multiple bearer connections within a single connection, demonstrating the flexibility and scalability of the network architecture.\nFigure 16.1.6.1-1: Two Unicast S2a bearers mapped in a single Point-to-Point connection (GTP based S2a)\nFor Trusted WLAN access to the EPC, the PDN connectivity service is provided by the point-to-point connectivity between the UE and the TWAG concatenated with S2a bearer(s) between the TWAG and the PDN GW.\nThe bearer model of GTP based S2a interface is similar to that of GTP based S5/S8 interface and GTP based S2b interface. The TWAN handles the uplink packets based on the uplink packet filters in the TFTs received from the PDN GW for the S2a bearers of the PDN connection, in the same way as an ePDG does for GTP based S2b interface.\nNOTE:\tThe WLCP bearer between the UE and the TWAG carries all S2a bearers traffic of the PDN connection. The TWAG routes uplink packets to the different bearers based on the uplink packet filters in the TFTs assigned to the bearers in the PDN connection, in the same way as a UE does for uplink traffic under 3GPP access. If no match is found, the uplink data packet shall be sent via the bearer that does not have any uplink packet filter assigned. If all bearers (including the default bearer for that PDN) have been assigned an uplink packet filter, the TWAG shall discard the uplink data packet.\nFigure 16.1.6.2-1 illustrates the mapping of two unicast S2a bearer connections to separate Wide Area Transport Control Protocol (WLAN Control Protocol, or WLCP) bearer connections. This is depicted through the use of GTP (GPRS Tunneling Protocol) for S2a bearer establishment. The figure highlights the process of unicast S2a bearer mapping to WLCP bearer, emphasizing the importance of this process in the overall network architecture. The visual representation of the mapping process provides a clear understanding of how unicast S2a bearer connections are efficiently managed and transferred to WLCP bearer connections, ensuring seamless communication and optimal network performance.\nFigure 16.1.6.2-1: Two Unicast S2a bearers mapped to separate WLCP bearers (GTP based S2a)\nThis scenario applies when the UE and the TWAG support multiple WLCP bearers,\nIn this scenario, one default S2a bearer is established on the S2a interface when the UE connects to a PDN, and the default S2a bearer remains established throughout the lifetime of the PDN connection to provide the UE with always-on IP connectivity to that PDN. Additional dedicated S2a bearers may be established on S2a for the same PDN connection depending on operator policy. The PGW establishes dedicated S2a bearers on S2a for the same PDN connection based on PCC decisions as specified in TS 23.203 [19].\nThe TWAG releases the WLCP PDN connection, when the default S2a bearer of the associated PDN connection is released.\nThe S2a bearer is realized with the following elements:\n-\tA GTP tunnel on S2a transports the packets of an S2a bearer between the TWAG and a PDN GW;\n-\tThe TWAG stores the mapping between WLCP bearer and the corresponding S2a bearer;\n-\tThe PDN GW stores the mapping between downlink packet filters and an S2a bearer.\nThe TWAG shall establish a WLCP bearer per dedicated bearer as per clause 16.5. The default S2a bearer maps to the initial WLCP bearer. The TWAG shall maintain a 1 to 1 mapping between an S2a bearer and a WLCP bearer.\nAdditionally, for these UEs, TFTs and dedicated bearer QoS information is conveyed from the TWAG to the UE in WLCP signalling associated with the corresponding WLCP bearer at S2a bearer creation and S2a bearer modification. The bearer QoS information includes information regarding the QoS characteristics of the bearer (i.e. QCI, GBR and MBR).\nThe TWAG routes uplink packets to the different bearers based on the incoming WLCP bearer and the corresponding S2a bearer. The TWAG may set a DiffServ Code Point for uplink packets based on the receipt of the MPS subscription notification from the UE, as per clause 7.2.4, or based on QCI, and optionally the ARP priority level.\nThe PDN GW routes downlink packets to the different bearers based on the downlink packet filters in the TFTs assigned to each of the S2a bearers in the PDN connection, in the same way as the PDN GW does on GTP-based S5/S8 bearers (see TS 23.401 [4] clause 4.7.2.2).\nThe UE routes uplink packets to the WLCP bearer based on the uplink packet filters in the TFTs assigned to the bearers in the PDN connection, in the same way as a UE does for uplink traffic under 3GPP access. If no match is found, the uplink data packet shall be sent via the bearer that does not have any uplink packet filter assigned. If all bearers (including the default bearer for that PDN) have been assigned an uplink packet filter, the UE shall discard the uplink data packet.\nTo support QoS differentiation,\n-\tfor downlink packets, if the TWAG sets the DSCP, the TWAG may use the QCI, and optionally the ARP, in WLCP bearer level QoS information to derive the DSCP value for downlink packets.\nNOTE 1:\tThe TWAG maintains the mapping of DSCP values used on S2a and the WLCP bearers.\nNOTE 2:\tBased on operator policy and/or regional/national regulations, the TWAG can apply a different DSCP value to downstream packets than the DSCP value received from the 3GPP system.\n-\tfor uplink packets, the UE shall either use the DSCP value that it received from the TWAG, or the QCI in dedicated bearer QoS information to set the DSCP value for uplink packets. The mapping of QoS class to DSCP could be configurable in the UE and as an example can use the recommended mappings specified in 3GPP (mapping between standardized QCIs and Release 99 QoS parameter value in TS 23.401 [4]) and IEEE Std. 802.11-2012 [64]. The UE may also use information included in dedicated QoS information for local aspects of admission control (e.g. application traffic shaping) however this is out of scope for this document.\n",

Such TWAN related Access Network Information may correspond to a \"TWAN Identifier\" and/or to a UE Time Zone.\nThe TWAN Identifier (reported over S2a, Gx, Gy, ...) shall include the SSID of the access point to which the UE is attached and shall include at least one of the following elements, unless otherwise determined by the TWAN operator's policies:\n-\tthe BSSID (see IEEE Std 802.11-2012 [64]);\n-\tcivic address information of the AP to which the UE is attached;\n.\tline identifier (Logical Access ID see ETSI ES 282 004 [77]) of the access point to which the UE is attached.\nNOTE 1:\tThe SSID can be the same for several WLAN APs and SSID only may not provide a location, but it might be sufficient for charging purposes.\nNOTE 2:\tThe Information carried as part of theTWAN Identifier should be defined to cater for extension in future releases.\nThe TWAN Id may also contain the identifier of the operator of the TWAN.

The figure depicts the various stages of GTP S2a setup, including the establishment of a new session, the negotiation of a GTP S2a connection, and the configuration of the GTP S2a parameters. The figure also shows the role of the Mobility Management Entity (MME) and the Gateway Control Plane (GCP) in facilitating the attachment process. The figure highlights the importance of efficient initial attachment in ensuring seamless connectivity and optimal performance in wireless networks.\nFigure 16.2.1-1: Initial attachment in WLAN on GTP S2a for roaming, LBO and non-roaming scenarios\nThe home routed roaming, LBO and non-roaming scenarios are depicted in the figure 16.2.1-1:\n-\tIn the LBO case, the 3GPP AAA Proxy acts as an intermediary, forwarding messages from the 3GPP AAA Server in the HPLMN to the PDN GW in the VPLMN and vice versa. Messages between the PDN GW in the VPLMN and the hPCRF in the HPLMN are forwarded by the vPCRF in the VPLMN.\n-\tIn the home routed roaming and non-roaming cases, the vPCRF is not involved. In the non-roaming cases, the 3GPP AAA Proxy is not involved. In home routed roaming case, the 3GPP AAA Proxy is not involved in steps 5 and 12.\nThis procedure is also used to establish the first PDN connection over a trusted WLAN with S2a when the UE already has active PDN connections only over a 3GPP access and wishes to establish simultaneous PDN connections to different APNs over multiple accesses.\nEither scenario (A) or scenario (B) is performed:\n-\tScenario (A) is defined as the TWAP sending the layer 2 attach trigger to the TWAG. This is done at successful EAP authentication (step 2). Completion of EAP authentication with the TWAP informing the UE of EAP success is deferred until step 8 after the tunnel was established (steps 3-7). The attach trigger signal sent from TWAP to TWAG includes MAC address and subscription data (including IMSI) of the UE. Steps 10-14 are omitted in scenario (A). Scenario (A) is applicable for all existing PDN Types (IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6) and is the recommended way. Scenario (A) is only applicable for single-connection mode and transparent single-connection mode.\n-\tScenario (B) is defined as the TWAG using the layer 3 attach request (i.e. a DHCPv4 message) sent by the UE as the attach trigger. In this scenario steps 3-7 are omitted. Step 9 triggers the TWAG to establish the tunnel (steps 10-14). Between step 2 and step 10, the TWAG obtains subscription data (including IMSI) for the UE from the TWAP, based on the MAC address of the UE. How this is performed is out-of-scope for 3GPP. Scenario (B) is only applicable for transparent single-connection mode with PDN Type IPv4.\nThe steps below only refer to TWAN, not to specific functions internal to TWAN (i.e. TWAG, TWAP and WLAN AN).\n1.\tThe initial TWAN specific L2 procedures are performed. These procedures are TWAN specific and are outside the scope of 3GPP.\n2.\tThe EAP authentication procedure is initiated and performed involving the UE, the TWAN and the 3GPP AAA Server. In the roaming case, there may be several AAA proxies involved. When receiving the first EAP message from the UE, the TWAN transfers it to the AAA server with an indication of the modes of operation that it supports and, if TWAN supports multi-connection mode, with the supported TWAG IPv4, IPv6 or both control plane addresses for WLCP transport. Subscription data is provided to the TWAN by the HSS/AAA in this step. The list of all the authorized APNs, including additional PDN GW selection information is returned to the TWAN as part of the reply from the 3GPP AAA Server to the TWAN as described in clause 4.5.1. The Subscription data may also include a default APN for WLAN that, in case of transparent single-connection mode, may be different from the default APN for other accesses. The 3GPP AAA Server also returns to the TWAN the User Identity to be used to identify the UE in the Create Session Request (step 3 or 10).\nDuring the EAP authentication procedure, the UE may negotiate with the AAA Server a connection mode (e.g. single-connection or multi-connection mode) as described in clause 16.1.4A. In addition, the UE may provide connectivity parameters during EAP authentication, as described below.\nDuring the EAP authentication procedure the 3GPP AAA Server may request the UE to provide its IMEI(SV). In that case the UE shall signal its IMEI(SV) to the 3GPP AAA Server. The 3GPP AAA Server forwards IMEI(SV) received from the UE to the TWAN (over STa).\nIf the UE requests single-connection mode, the UE provides a connectivity parameter indicating the type of requested connectivity, i.e. whether it requests EPC access or non-seamless WLAN offload. If the UE requests EPC access, it may provide additional connectivity parameters such as the PDN type, attach type (initial attach), the requested APN and Protocol Configuration Options. These connectivity parameters are sent to the 3GPP AAA Server during the EAP-AKA' authentication procedure. The 3GPP AAA Server sends these connectivity parameters to the TWAN.\nIf the UE requests multi-connection mode and, if this request is accepted by the network, the UE is also made aware if non-seamless WLAN offload is authorized. If non-seamless WLAN offload is authorized, then the UE receives the address or prefix of the non-seamless WLAN offload connection as part of steps 9 and 15. In multi-connection mode, steps 3-7 and steps 10-14 are skipped. If the UE requests multi-connection mode and this request is accepted by the network, the AAA server using EAP-AKA' procedure provides the UE with the supported TWAG control plane address(es), among which the UE selects a single address to be used for WLCP.\nIf the 3GPP AAA server does not provide network connection mode capabilities or, if the 3GPP AAA server does not receive a connection mode request from the UE, then the transparent single-connection mode is used.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the transparent single-connection mode is used, then it is recommended that the default APN for TWAN is different from any APN that the UE may use on the 3GPP side. Nevertheless, for an UE the default APN for TWAN may be used on other access technologies. In that case:\n-\tThe TWAN may select a single or different PDN GWs for PDN connections to this APN that are active at the same time via the 3GPP access network and the TWAN. If a single PDN GW is selected then the APN-AMBR is enforced for all PDN connections for that APN. If different PDN GWs are selected then the APN-AMBR is enforced separately in the respective PDN GW for the PDN connection, i.e. the UE will receive double amount of bandwidth for the APN;\n-\tThe PDN GW identity provided by the 3GPP AAA server to HSS as part of the Initial Attach on TWAN may be different from and overwrite the PDN GW identity provided, for the same APN, by the MME/SGSN or by another PDN GW. Therefore, to avoid interfering with the PDN Connections over 3GPP access, the HSS should not be updated with the selected PDN GW identity for Trusted WLAN access. The 3GPP AAA Server could be configured to not provide the PDN GW identity selected as part of the Initial Attach on TWAN to HSS. This applies to step 5 and step 12 of this procedure. Depending on operator deployment there may also be proprietary means in the HPLMN to ensure that the HSS is not updated with the selected PDN GW identity for Trusted WLAN access.\n-\tThe PDN GW identity provided by the MME/SGSN to HSS as part of the Initial Attach on 3GPP may be different from the PDN GW identity selected for the same APN by the TWAN. As there is no mobility support, no action from the TWAN is expected when the TWAN is updated with the selected PDN GW identity for 3GPP access;\n-\tPMIP-based S5/S8 with dynamic PCC can not be deployed since it will result in wrong session linking between Gateway Control Session and Gx session in the PCRF.\nIEEE Std 802.1X-2004 [65] is used over the WLAN air link to carry EAP as defined by IEEE Std 802.11-2012 [64].\nThe TWAN may provide to the 3GPP AAA server via STa the SSID selected by the UE to access the TWAN and an indication whether it supports S2a, non-seamless offload, or both.\nIf the transparent single-connection mode is used, then the HSS/AAA may indicate via STa whether access to EPC via S2a or the use of NSWO or both are allowed for this subscriber. The HSS/AAA decision to allow EPC access or NSWO or both could be based on information elements such as subscriber profile, access network, and/or SSID selected. If the HSS/AAA decides to allow both EPC access and NSWO, the TWAN determines based on pre-configured information whether or not to establish S2a. If the TWAN determined that S2a shall not be used steps 3-7 and 10-14 are skipped. Instead, if it is authorized, the TWAN performs NSWO for the subscriber.\nNOTE 2:\tFor transparent single-connection mode, the authorization of both NSWO and EPC routed traffic by the 3GPP AAA is only applicable in non-roaming scenarios.\nIf the UE requests single-connection mode, the HSS/AAA indicates via STa its decision to accept the single-connection mode with either EPC access or NSWO. The TWAN determines based on the indication from HSS/AAA whether or not to perform PDN GW selection and S2a connection establishment. If the UE requested NSWO and it was accepted by the network, steps 3-7 and 10-14 are skipped.\nSimilar to 3GPP access, at the start of the EAP authentication procedure, a UE with MPS subscription as provisioned on the USIM that supports MPS over trusted WLAN feature shall indicate its MPS subscription in the username part of the NAI according to TS 23.003 [16]. When receiving the first EAP message from the UE including an indication of MPS subscription, based on operator policy, the TWAN transfers it to the AAA server with priority and the AAA server shall handle this message with priority. In addition, the Subscription data that is provided to the TWAN by the HSS/AAA shall also include an indication of MPS subscription, if the UE has an MPS subscription.\n2a)\tIf IMEI check is required by operator policy and if the TWAN is in the HPLMN, the IMEI check shall be performed by the EIR in the home country. The 3GPP AAA server shall request the EIR to perform the IMEI check by sending the ME Identity Check Request (ME Identity, IMSI) to the EIR. Upon receiving the ME Identity Check Ack (Result) from the EIR, the 3GPP AAA server shall determine whether to continue or to stop the authentication and authorization procedure. If the 3GPP AAA server determines that the authentication and authorization procedure shall be stopped, it shall notify the UE with an appropriate cause value.\n2b)\tIf IMEI check is required by operator policy and if the TWAN is in the visited PLMN, the IMEI check shall be performed by the EIR in the visited country. In order to retrieve the IMEI(SV) from the UE, the 3GPP AAA proxy shall send a request to the 3GPP AAA server, which contains\ta parameter \"IMEI check request in VPLMN\" that indicates that the IMEI(SV) shall be retrieved by the 3GPP AAA server and shall be checked by the visited country EIR. The absence of this parameter indicates that IMEI check should not be performed.\nIf \"IMEI check request in VPLMN\" is set, the AAA server shall retrieve the IMEI(SV) from the UE and return it to the TWAN with the \"IMEI check request in VPLMN\". If the TWAN receives the \"IMEI check request in VPLMN\" together with the IMEI(SV), it shall forward the IMEI(SV) to the 3GPP AAA proxy, which shall request the EIR to perform the IMEI check by sending the ME Identity Check Request (ME Identity, IMSI) to the EIR. Upon receiving the ME Identity Check Ack (Result) from the EIR, the 3GPP AAA proxy shall determine whether to continue or to stop the authentication and authorization procedure. If the 3GPP AAA proxy determines that the authentication and authorization procedure shall be stopped, it shall forward the TWAN message together with the indication that the procedure shall be stopped. In this case, the AAA server shall notify the UE with an appropriate cause value.\nThe following steps 3-7 are only performed in scenario (A):\n3.\tThe TWAN selects the S2a protocol variant (either GTP or PMIP; GTP in this case). The TWAN may be configured with the S2a protocol variant(s) on a per HPLMN granularity, or may retrieve information regarding the S2a protocol variants supported by the PDN GW (PMIP or/and GTP) from the Domain Name Service function.\nThe TWAN selects the PGW as per the PGW selection procedure in clause 4.5.1; if the TWAN receives a PGW Identity under the form of a FQDN, it shall derive from the FQDN an IP address of a PGW for the selected mobility management protocol (GTP in this case).\nNOTE 3:\tAs for existing principles, to support separate PDN GW addresses at a PDN GW for different mobility protocols (e.g. PMIP or GTPv2), when deriving a PDN GW address with the Domain Name Service function, the PDN GW Selection function takes into account the mobility protocol type.\nIf the UE did not provide a requested APN in step 2, the TWAN selects the default APN according to the subscription data received in step 2. If the UE requested EPC access and indicated an APN in step 2, the TWAN verifies that it is allowed by subscription and selects that APN. The TWAN sends a Create Session Request (IMSI, APN, RAT type, TWAN TEID of the control plane, PDN Type, PDN Address, EPS Bearer Identity, Default EPS Bearer QoS, TWAN Address for the user plane, TWAN TEID of the user plane, APN-AMBR, Selection Mode, Dual Address Bearer Flag, Trace Information, Charging Characteristics, Serving Network, Additional parameters, Initial Attach Indication, IMEI(SV)) message to the PDN GW. The RAT type indicates the non-3GPP IP access technology type. The PDN Type shall be set based on the result of step 2. The TWAN shall set the Dual Address Bearer Flag when the PDN type is set to IPv4v6. The TWAN shall include Trace Information if PDN GW trace is activated. The Serving Network parameter identifies the selected PLMN used for 3GPP-based access authentication i.e. the VPLMN in roaming case, and the HPLMN in non-roaming case. The optional Additional Parameters may contain information, for example, Protocol Configuration Options. Additionally, the Create Session Request includes the current TWAN Identifier as described in clause 16.1.7 and the UE Time Zone. The IMEI(SV) shall be provided to the PDN GW if received from the AAA server.\nThe PDN GW creates a new entry in its bearer context table and generates a Charging Id. The new entry allows the PDN GW to route user plane PDUs between the TWAN and the packet data network and to start charging.\nNOTE 4:\tThe EPS Bearer Identity and Default EPS Bearer QoS parameters convey the S2a bearer identity and the default S2a bearer QoS.\n4.\tThe PDN GW initiates the IP-CAN Session Establishment Procedure with the PCRF, as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The PDN GW provides information to the PCRF used to identify the session. The PCRF creates IP-CAN session related information and responds to the PDN GW with PCC rules and event triggers. The PCRF may modify the APN-AMBR and send the APN-AMBR to the PDN GW in the response message.\n5.\tThe selected PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of its PDN GW identity and the APN corresponding to the UE's PDN Connection. The message includes information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located. This information is registered in the HSS as described in clause 12.\nWhen informing the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN GW identity, the selected PDN GW also indicates the selected S2a protocol variant (GTP in this case); this allows the option for the 3GPP AAA Server or 3GPP AAA Proxy not to return to the PDN GW PMIP specific parameters (e.g. static QoS Profile, Trace Information, APN-AMBR) if GTP is used over S2a; the PDN GW shall ignore those parameters if received from the 3GPP AAA Server or 3GPP AAA Proxy.\n6.\tThe PDN GW returns a Create Session Response (PDN GW Address for the user plane, PDN GW TEID of the user plane, PDN GW TEID of the control plane, PDN Type, PDN Address, EPS Bearer Identity, EPS Bearer QoS, APN-AMBR, Additional parameters possibly including Protocol Configuration Options, Cause) message to the TWAN, including the IP address(es) allocated for the UE.\nThe PDN GW may initiate the creation of dedicated bearers on GTP based S2a (as it does on GTP based S5/S8 for an Attach on 3GPP access).\n7.\tThe GTP tunnel is set up between the TWAN and the PDN GW as described in step 3.\n8.\tIn single-connection mode, the TWAN informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the result of the tunnel setup, including APN, TWAG User Plane MAC address, accepted PDN Type, PDN Address and Additional Parameters received from the PGW. The UE is made aware if the requested connectivity type (non-seamless WLAN offload, EPC access with a requested APN) is accepted by the 3GPP AAA server. The TWAG User Plane MAC address is the MAC address of the TWAN which is used by the UE and the TWAN for encapsulating user plane packets. The 3GPP AAA server also indicates to the UE the TWAG User Plane MAC address, accepted PDN type, PDN Address, Additional Parameters. Also, if the UE requested EPC access without indicating a requested APN, then the network indicates the selected (default) APN. If the requested connectivity feature is not possible, the 3GPP AAA server rejects the request with a relevant authorization failure cause code.\nIn multi-connection mode, the TWAN shall be configured to accept WLCP traffic from the UE; otherwise the TWAN shall discard WLCP traffic from the UE.\nTWAN sends EAP success to the UE thus completing EAP authentication.\nAfter EAP authentication, UE traffic over the WLAN air link may be confidentiality and integrity protected as defined by IEEE Std 802.11-2012 [64].\nNOTE 5:\tIn transparent single-connection mode, it is implementation dependent if step 8 is performed before, after or in parallel to steps 3-7.\n9.\tIn transparent single-connection mode, the UE may send layer 3 attach request, (e.g. a DHCPv4 request as per IETF RFC 2131 [28]). In multi-connection mode, if UE uses IPv4, the UE obtains an IPv4 address to be used for WLCP transport and NSWO (if authorized) at this step.\nNOTE 6:\tThe UE may send IPv6 Router Solicitation at any time after step 8.\nNOTE 7:\tIt is assumed that, to identify the UE, the L3 attach request is transported in an L2 frame that contains the UE L2 address (MAC address).\n10-14.\tThese steps are equal to step 3-7.\nNOTE 8:\tThese steps are only performed for scenario (B), which is only possible in the case of transparent single-connection mode when the PDN type is IPv4 and a DHCPv4 request was sent in step 9.\n15.\tIn transparent single connection mode and in multi-connection mode, a DHCPv4 message with allocated IPv4 address and/or Router Advertisement with IPv6 prefix is sent to the UE. The UE may perform additional IP layer configuration with the TWAN as per standard IETF procedures, e.g. IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration as per IETF RFC 4862 [58], and Stateless DHCPv6 as per IETF RFC 3736 [30].\nFor single-connection mode, a Router Advertisement with IPv6 prefix may be sent to the UE. The UE may perform additional IP layer configuration as per standard IETF procedures, e.g. IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration as per IETF RFC 4862 [58], and Stateless DHCPv6 as per IETF RFC 3736 [30].\nNOTE 9:\tFor transparent single connection mode, a UE may request to get some IP configuration parameters (e.g. DNS server) by means of DHCP. These parameters sent by TWAN (acting as a DHCP server) to the UE in a DHCP reply. These parameters are retrieved by the TWAN from the PGW within Create Session Response.\nNOTE 10:\tFor scenario (A), after step 8, the TWAN may send unsolicited IP layer configuration signalling, e.g. RA, over the point-to-point link towards the UE.\n16.\tIn multi-connection mode, the procedure \"UE initiated PDN connectivity request procedure in WLAN on S2a\" in clause 16.8 may be performed to establish a PDN connection.\n",

Dependent upon the result, the 3GPP AAA server or 3GPP AAA proxy in roaming case decides whether to continue or to stop the authentication and authorization procedure is based on operator policies.\nIn attach for emergency service NSWO is not allowed.\nThe TWAN may provide to the 3GPP AAA server the location information defined in clause 16.1.7 via STa.\nDuring the negotiation between the UE and the AAA server, if the network supports emergency session with unauthenticated UEs and if the UE has not been successfully authenticated by the network, the network shall use the single-connection mode.\nIf the Transparent Single-Connection Mode is selected by the network (because e.g. it does not support single-connection mode), and the UE supports emergency service, the UE shall abort the authentication.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the UE support ES on SCM or MCM, but the network support only transparent single-connection mode, the ES procedure shall be aborted by UE, since the 3GPP AAA server may have ignored the emergency service indication send by UE and continuated the authentication procedure.\n-\tUpon a successful authorization by the 3GPP AAA server, the TWAN stores subscription information if they are received from the 3GPP AAA, but does not use this information for the emergency PDN connection. It instead uses Emergency Configuration Data to get information on the APN and possibly PDN GW and / or QoS (APN-AMBR, default QoS) to use for the emergency PDN connection.\nThe following steps 3-7 are only performed in scenario (A):\n3.\tThe TWAN sends a Create Session Request message to the PGW as described in step 3 of clause 16.2.1 but with following specificities:\n-\tNo parameter in the Create Session Request message is related with the user subscription. Parameters in the Emergency Configuration Data are used instead;\n-\tNo Additional Parameters are provided for additional authentication and authorisation with an external AAA Server;\n-\tThe PDN GW derives the emergency related policies to apply from the APN received in the Create Session Request message;\n-\tFor emergency attached UEs, if the IMSI cannot be authenticated or the UE has not provided it (according to cases c) and d) as defined in TS 23.401 [4], clause 4.3.12), then the IMEI shall be used as UE identifier.

The diagram highlights the role of the SGW, Mobility Management Entity (MME), and other network components in managing the PDN connection and ensuring a smooth transition for the UE.\nFigure 16.3.1.1-1: UE/TWAN Initiated Detach and UE/TWAN requested PDN Disconnection on GTP S2a\nThe procedure for UE/ TWAN Initiated Detach is represented in Figure 16.3.1.1-1 and described below.\nThis procedure applies to the transparent single-connection mode. This procedure also applies to the single-connection mode with the exception that step1 refers to clause 16.7.1.1.\nThis procedure applies to the Non-Roaming, Home Routed Roaming and Local Breakout cases. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the Home Routed Roaming and LBO cases, the 3GPP AAA Proxy serves as an intermediary between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA Server in the HPLMN. In the non-roaming and Home Routed Roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at all.\nIf dynamic policy provisioning is not deployed, the optional steps of interaction between the PDN GW and PCRF do not occur. Instead, the PDN GW may employ static configured policies.\n1)\tTo detach from EPC, the UE can send a disassociation or deauthentication notification according to \nIEEE Std 802.11-2012 [64]. Any time after the UE releases the IPv4 address using DHCPv4 or IPv4 address lease time expires, and if the PDN Type is IPv4, the TWAN initiates \"TWAN initiated PDN Disconnection Procedure\" procedure. If there is no traffic received from the UE for a configurable duration and the TWAN detects the UE has left based on unanswered probes (e.g., ARP Request, Neighbor Solicitation message), the TWAN triggers PDN disconnection.\n2)\tThe TWAN releases the PDN connection by sending a Delete Session Request (Linked EPS Bearer ID, TWAN Release Cause if available) message for the PDN connection to the PDN GW.

If received from the TWAN, the PDN GW shall also provide the TWAN Release Cause as well as,  if available, the User Location Information that contains the TWAN Identifier and/or UE Time Zone and PCRF shall forward them to the Application Function as specified in TS 23.203 [19].\n5)\tThe PDN GW acknowledges with Delete Session Response (Cause).\n6)\tThe TWAN locally removes the UE context and deauthenticates and disassociates the UE at Layer 2 according to IEEE Std. 802.11-2012 [64].\nNOTE:\tThe L2 disassociation serves as an indication to the UE that the previous IPv4 address/IPv6 prefix might no longer be valid. When UE connects to the network next time, the UE proceeds with re-validation or re-acquisition of its IPv4 address / IPv6 prefix.\nFigure 16.3.1.2-1 illustrates the process of HSS/AAA initiated detach on GTP S2a, which is a crucial step in the termination of a GTP tunnel. The figure depicts the interaction between the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) and the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server, as well as the Gateway Control Protocol (GTP) signaling. The HSS initiates the detach process, which involves the release of the GTP tunnel resources and the finalization of the associated sessions. This figure is essential for understanding the network termination process and ensuring a smooth transition for subscribers.\nFigure 16.3.1.2-1: HSS/AAA Initiated Detach on GTP S2a\nThe procedure for HSS/AAA Initiated Detach from TWAN is represented in Figure 16.3.1.2-1 and described below.\nThis procedure applies to the transparent single-connection mode and the single-connection mode.\nThis procedure applies to the Non-Roaming, Home Routed Roaming and Local Breakout cases.

The AP then sends a Detach Confirm back to the UE, indicating that the detachment process is complete. The figure also shows the role of the Transport and Tunnel Access Network (TWAN) in facilitating this process, ensuring secure and reliable communication between the UE and the AP.\nFigure 16.7.2.1-1: UE/TWAN Initiated Detach in WLAN on PMIP S2a\nThe procedure is similar to GTP based S2a call flows in clause 16.7.1.1, with the following differences:\n-\tStep 2 is a Proxy Binding Update.

This procedure is also used to request for connectivity to an additional PDN over a trusted WLAN with GTP on S2a when the UE is simultaneously connected to E-UTRAN and a trusted WLAN, and the UE already has active PDN connections over both the accesses.\nThere can be more than one PDN connection per APN when GTP is used between the TWAN and the PDN GW. During the establishment of a new PDN connection, the TWAN allocates and sends a default EPS bearer ID to the PDN GW. The default EPS bearer ID is unique in the scope of the UE within a TWAG, i.e. the IMSI and the default EPS bearer ID togther identify a PDN connection within a TWAG. In order to be able to identify a specific established PDN connection, both the TWAG and the PDN GW shall store the default EPS bearer ID.\nAn UE attached for emergency services shall not initiate any additional PDN Connectivity Request procedure. An UE attached for regular services may request a PDN connection for emergency services if an emergency PDN connection is not already active.\nFigure 16.8.1-1 illustrates the process of a User Equipment (UE) initiating a connection to the Public Data Network (PDN) in a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) using the Generic Terminal Mode (GTM) over the Session Initiation Protocol (S2) version 2a. The figure depicts the various components involved, including the UE, Access Point (AP), Gateway (GW), and the PDN. The diagram showcases the data flow and signaling between these entities, highlighting the importance of GTP S2a in establishing and maintaining the connection. The figure emphasizes the efficiency and reliability of wireless connectivity in modern communication networks.\nFigure 16.8.1-1: UE-Initiated Connectivity to PDN in WLAN on GTP S2a\nThis procedure applies to the Non-Roaming, Home Routed Roaming and Local Breakout cases. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the Home Routed Roaming and LBO cases, the 3GPP AAA Proxy serves as an intermediary between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA Server in the HPLMN. In the non-roaming and Home Routed Roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at all.\nIf dynamic policy provisioning is not deployed, the optional steps of interaction between the PDN GW and PCRF do not occur.\n1.\tThe UE sends a WLCP PDN Connection Request (APN, PDN Type, Protocol Configuration Options, Request Type, Multiple Bearer Capability Indicator) to the TWAN. The UE sends the WLCP PDN Connection Request to the control plane address of TWAN it received during EAP authentication and authorization procedure as described in clause 16.2.1. The Request Type indicates \"initial request\" when the UE requests new PDN connection over the WLAN access network. The UE may indicate the requested APN. If the UE does not indicate an APN, then the default APN will be used in the following steps. The Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) may be sent to transfer parameters to the PDN GW, and is sent transparently through the TWAN. The Multiple Bearer Capability Indicator indicates if UE supports multiple WLCP bearers per PDN connection.\n2-6.\tStep 2 to Step 6 are described as Step 3 to Step 7 in clause 16.2.1.\n7.\tThe TWAN returns a WLCP PDN Connection Response (APN, PDN Type, PDN Address, PDN Connection ID, User Plane Connection ID, Protocol Configuration Options) message to the UE to acknowledge the establishment of a new point-to-point link between the UE and the TWAG. The User Plane Connection ID is the per-UE unique MAC address of the TWAN which is used by the UE and the TWAN for encapsulating user plane packets for the default bearer of this PDN connection. If the Multiple Bearer Capability Indicator is not set in step 1 or if the TWAG does not support multiple WLCP bearers per PDN connection, the provided MAC address will be used for all traffic of this PDN connection. If the UE did not indicate the APN in the WLCP PDN Connection Request, then the response indicates the APN selected by the network (e.g. the default APN). The PDN Connection ID is stored in the TWAN to associate the established point-to-point link between the UE and TWAG with all the S2a bearers for this PDN connection. The PDN Connection ID is sent to and stored in the UE to identify this new established PDN connection. The UE will use this PDN Connection ID in subsequent procedures, such as PDN disconnection procedure.\nIf the IPv6 prefix is allocated, a Router Advertisement with the IPv6 prefix is sent to the UE after step 7. The UE may perform additional IP layer configuration as per standard IETF procedures, e.g. IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration according to IETF RFC 4862 [58], and Stateless DHCPv6 according to IETF RFC 3736 [30].\nIn the case of a PDN connection for emergency services:\n-\tif the TWAN supports emergency services and is located in the same country as the UE, the above procedure takes place with following exceptions:\n-\tThe UE adds an emergency request indication in the WLCP PDN Connection Request sent to the TWAG;\n-\tWhen the WLCP PDN Connection Request contains an emergency request indication, the TWAG ignores any APN received from the UE in that message, considers that the target APN is the APN configured within its Emergency Configuration Data and does not check whether this APN is part of the subscription of the UE;\n-\tStep 5 applies with the following addition: When informing the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN GW identity, the selected PDN GW also indicates that the PDN GW is used for emergency services. The AAA server then sends the \"PDN GW currently in use for emergency services\", which comprises the PDN GW address and an indication that the PDN connection is for emergency services to the HSS.\n-\tif the TWAN does not support emergency services or is not located in the same country as the UE, the UE shall detach from the TWAN in order to attach to another TWAN that supports emergency services.\n",

The PDN GW executes a PCEF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The Event Report indicates the change in Access Type.\nIf the PDN GW decides to allocate a new IP address/prefix instead of preserving the old IP address/prefix, as described in clause 4.1.3.2.3, the PDN GW executes an IP-CAN session Establishment Procedure with the PCRF instead of a PCEF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification Procedure.\n-\tStep 6.

The Create Session Response contains the IP address and/or the prefix that was assigned to the UE while it was connected to the 3GPP IP access. The Charging Id provided by the PGW is the Charging Id previously assigned to the default bearer of the PDN connection in the 3GPP access. For emergency sessions, the TWAN also includes the PDN GW address obtained in step 4.\nDepending upon the active PCC rules, the PDN GW may create dedicated bearers on S2a interface. And in that case, it applies the Charging ID previously in use for the corresponding dedicated bearer(s) while the UE was connected to the 3GPP IP access (i.e. bearer with the same QCI and ARP as in 3GPP access).\n-\tStep 10: This step is the same as step 15 in 16.2.1.\n-\tStep 11.

This step is the same as step 2 of the initial attach procedure in clause 16.2.1 for non-emergency sessions and in clause 16.2.1a for emergency sessions, where in this case Multi-Connection Mode is requested by the UE.\nFor emergency sessions, following modifications apply:\n-\tDuring authentication and authorization, the HSS shall provide the AAA server with the \"PDN GW currently in use for emergency services\", if available, as part of the subscription information, relayed by the AAA server to the TWAN;\n-\tIf the UE indicated an handover attach in step 2 is non-roaming and has been successfully authenticated, based on operator policy, the TWAN may select the \"PDN GW currently in use for emergency services\" as anchor PDN GW. Otherwise, e.g. if the UE indicated an handover attach in step 2 and has been authorized but not authenticated), or the UE is roaming, or based on operator configuration (e.g. the network supports handovers to/from HRPD), the TWAN shall select the PDN GW that is statically configured in the TWAN Emergency Configuration Data.\n3.\tTWAN sends EAP success to the UE and completing EAP authentication. This step is the same as step 8 of the initial attach procedure in clause 16.2.1.\n4.\tIf NSWO is authorized for the UE in step 2, anytime after step 3 the UE may send a L3 attach request to the TWAN for NSWO and receive the address or prefix of the NSWO from TWAN.\n5.\tThe UE performs UE-initiated connectivity request procedure for Multi-Connection Mode according to clause 16.8.1 with the following exception:\na)\tThe UE sends a PDN Connectivity Request message to the TWAN with Request Type indicating \"Handover\".\nb)\tThe UE indicates the APN corresponding to the PDN connection which is being handed over to TWAN in the PDN Connectivity Request message. If the APN is not provided, and the subscription context from HSS/AAA contains a PDN GW identity and APN pair corresponding to the default APN, the TWAN uses the default APN for non-emergency sessions and the emergency APN for emergency sessions.\nc)\tUpon receiving the PDN Connectivity Request message, the TWAN selects the PDN GW as indicated in the subscription data received from the 3GPP AAA Server and sends Create Session Request to the selected PDN GW. Since the Request Type is \"Handover\", a Handover Indication is included in the Create Session Request. In the case of emergency sessions when the UE has been authorized but not authenticated, the TWAN selects the PDN GW that is statically configured in the TWAN Emergency Configuration Data.\nd)\tSince it is a handover, the IP-CAN Session Establishment is not performed. The PDN GW may execute a PCEF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19] to report e.g. change in IP-CAN type.\nNOTE:\tIn case there are multiple PDN connections to the same APN the PDN connection is selected by the PDN GW as it is specified in clause 8.1\n6.\tThe PDN GW shall initiate the PDN GW Initiated PDN Disconnection procedure in 3GPP access as defined in clause 5.6.2.2 or the PDN GW Initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure as defined in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.4.4.1.\nDepending upon the active PCC rules, the PDN GW may create dedicated bearers on S2a interface. And in that case, it applies the Charging ID previously in use for the corresponding dedicated bearer(s) while the UE was connected to the 3GPP IP access (i.e. bearer with the same QCI and ARP as in 3GPP access).\nThis procedure is as in clause 16.10.2.1 with the following differences:\nStep 5 c)\tUpon receiving the PDN Connection Request message, the TWAN selects the PDN GW as indicated in the subscription data received from the 3GPP AAA Server and sends the Proxy Binding Update to the selected PDN GW by setting the Handover Indicatior to indicate handoff between two different interfaces of the UE.

            "description": "The \"direct peering\" scenario consists in having one of the two roaming partners provide support for both variants of roaming flavour (e.g. a PMIP operator would support GTP-based roaming interface towards a GTP-only roaming partner, or vice versa) in order to make roaming possible.\nThe support for such roaming flavour can be provided either on the same GW node or on different GW nodes. Upon establishment of connectivity for a specific roaming UE, the Visited network chooses a GTP-based or a PMIP-based S8 interface (on the same GW node or on different GW nodes, note that for a single user only a single Serving GW is allocated when connecting to EPC), depending on the preferences of the roaming partner that owns the subscriber.\nFigure A.1-1 illustrates two direct peering examples between a PMIP-based VPLMN and a GTP-based HPLMN, as well as between a GTP-based VPLMN and a PMIP-based HPLMN. These examples demonstrate the interworking of different network protocols and the establishment of direct connections between various layers of the network. The diagram highlights the importance of these direct peering relationships in facilitating efficient communication and ensuring seamless connectivity across different network domains.\nFigure A.1-1: Direct peering examples: a) PMIP-based VPLMN to GTP-based HPLMN; b) GTP-based VPLMN to PMIP-based HPLMN\nDepicted in Figure A.1-1 (a) is an example of \"direct peering\" interworking between a GTP-based HPLMN and a PMIP-based VPLMN. When roamers whose subscription is owned by the GTP-based operator attach to the EPS network of the PMIP-based operator, they are assigned a GTP-capable GW acting in the role of S-GW. The S-GW selection is carried out by MME or SGSN based on the subscriber's HPLMN. In case of the Serving GW supporting both GTP and PMIP, the MME/SGSN should indicate the Serving GW which protocol should be used over S5/S8 interface.\nDepicted in Figure A.1-1 (b) is an example of \"direct peering\" interworking between a PMIP-based HPLMN and a GTP-based VPLMN. When roamers whose subscription is owned by the PMIP-based operator attach to the EPS network of the GTP-based operator, they are assigned a GTP-capable S-GW. The information provided by the PMIP-based HPLMN for the P-GW selection function must take into account that the Visited network is GTP-only, in order to return either the IP address (or an APN that can be resolved to an IP address according to the PDN GW resolution mechanism) that points to a GTP-capable PDN GW.\nFigure A.1-2 depicts the scenario in which a UE from a GTP-based network roams in a PMIP-based network, local breakout is used, and home-routed bearers are also possible. As with the home-routed case, the MME or SGSN in the PMIP-based VPLMN selects a GTP-capable Serving GW, but it selects a PMIP capable PDN GW. As a result, the S-GW in this example supports both GTP and PMIP based S5/S8. This allows the local breakout bearer and any associated home-routed bearer for the user (e.g. the default bearer) to be served by the same Serving GW. Support of S9 may not be required in all local breakout scenarios.\nFigure A.1-2 illustrates a direct peering example involving a local breakout and a user equipment (UE) from a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Home Location Register (HLR) Mobile Country Code (MCC) in a Public Mobile Internationalization Protocol (PMIP) Virtual Private Mobile Network (VPLMN). The figure demonstrates the process of UE roaming in a PMIP VPLMN while being in a GTP HPLMN roaming scenario. The diagram showcases the various components involved, such as the GTP HPLMN, PMIP VPLMN, and the UE, as well as the signaling and data exchange between them. The figure highlights the importance of direct peering in ensuring efficient and seamless roaming services for mobile users.\nFigure A.1-2: Direct peering example: Local Breakout, UE from GTP HPLMN Roaming in PMIP VPLMN\nFigure A.1-3 depicts the scenario in which a UE from a PMIP-based network roams into a GTP-based network and local breakout is used. As with the home-routed case, the MME/SGSN in the GTP-based VPLMN selects a GTP-capable Serving GW and the PDN GW selection function selects a GTP-capable PDN GW. This allows the local breakout bearer and any associated home-routed bearer for the user (e.g., the default bearer) to be served by the same Serving GW. Support of S9 may not be required in all local breakout scenarios.\nFigure A.1-3 illustrates a direct peering example involving a local breakout and a UE from a PMIP HPLMN roaming in a GTP VPLMN. The figure showcases the process of establishing a direct peering connection between two networks, allowing for efficient data exchange and seamless service continuity. The diagram highlights the key components involved, including the local breakout, the UE, and the GTP VPLMN, emphasizing the importance of these elements in maintaining a robust and reliable roaming infrastructure.\nFigure A.1-3: Direct peering example: Local Breakout, UE from PMIP HPLMN Roaming in GTP VPLMN\n",

            "description": "This clause shows a call flow for a handover when UE moves from a source trusted/untrusted non-3GPP IP access network to a target trusted non-3GPP access network. PMIPv6 is assumed to be used on S2a and DSMIPv6 is assumed to be used on source trusted/untrusted access network.\nFigure C.4-1 illustrates the handover process between S2c and S2a using PMIPv6 over both trusted and untrusted Non-3GPP IP access. The figure depicts the path taken by the data packet as it transitions from the S2c to the S2a, highlighting the role of the Mobility Management Entity (MME) and the Home Agent (HA) in managing the handover. The figure also shows the use of PMIPv6, which provides improved security and efficiency in IP-based networks. The visual representation of the handover process is crucial for understanding the intricacies of mobile network operations and the importance of secure and efficient data transmission.\nFigure C.4-1: S2c over trusted or untrusted Non-3GPP IP access to S2a (PMIPv6) Handover\nThis procedure supports the non-roaming (Figure 4.2.2.1), home routed roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1) and roaming with Local breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) case. The PCRF in the HPLMN is informed of the change of access and any change in the policy that results is signalled to the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access. The signalling takes place through the vPCRF in the VPLMN. In the case of roaming with Local Breakout, the PDN GW in the VPLMN exchanges messages with the vPCRF.\nThe optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the above figure only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateways.\nIn case of connectivity to multiple PDNs, step 8 is repeated for each PDN the UE is connected to. This step can occur in parallel for each PDN. Other impacts related to the handover for multiple PDNs are described in clause 8.1. Alternatively, if supported by non-3GPP access technology and if the UE does not provide any APN upon handover attach in the trusted non-3GPP IP access, Step 5 is repeated for each PDN the UE is connected to, instead of Step 8. DSMIPv6 de-registration in step 9 will be performed for each PDN connection. These steps can occur in parallel for each PDN.\n1.\tThe UE is connected to the trusted/untrusted Non-3GPP Access using S2c.\n1a.

In the roaming case, there may be several AAA proxies involved. As part of the authentication procedure, the information of the selected PDN GW, e.g. PDN GW's address, is conveyed to the MAG in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Accesses. The PDNs the UE is connected to are obtained from the HSS with the UE subscriber profile.\n4.\tAfter successful authentication and authorization, the L3 attach procedure is triggered.\n5.\tThe UE continues the attach to the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access as defined in Steps 5-8 of Figure 8.2.2-1, except that the IP CAN session modification defined in step 7 is triggered as explained below.\n6.\tL3 attach procedure is completed. IP connectivity between the UE and the PDN GW is set for uplink and downlink direction over the trusted non-3GPP IP access.\n7.\tThe PMIPv6 tunnel is set up between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the PDN GW. The UE can send/receive IP packets at this point.\n8.\tIn case of connectivity to multiple PDNs, the UE establishes connectivity to all the PDNs besides the Default PDN that the UE was connected to before the handover as described in clause 6.8.1.\n9.\tThe UE sends a BU (lifetime) to the PDN GW to de-register its DSMIPv6 binding that was created while the UE was in non-3GPP access system. The PDN GW responds with a BA message.\nAny time after step 5, prior to receiving the de-registration Binding Update from the UE, the PDN GW may de-register the DSMIPv6 binding. In this case the PDN GW shall send a Binding Revocation Indication message to the UE.\nFollowing the de-registration of the DSMIPv6 binding due to reception of de-registration Binding update or due to triggering Binding Revocation, the PDN GW triggers PCEF initiated IP CAN session modification, instead of doing it as part of the step 5.\n10.\tThe PCRF initiates \"PCRF-initiated Gateway Control Session Termination\" procedure to release the resources in the non-3GPP access. This procedure is triggered by the PCEF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification Procedure with the PCRF.\n",

For example, a given SSID <ssid_x> may provide EPC-routed access for subscriber A and only allow non-seamless WLAN offload for subscriber B. In such a deployment it is up to the operator to provide network configuration that supports different user access preferences, subscriptions and UE configurations.\nIt is recommended that the UE can be configured to apply different behavior when connected to different SSIDs, e.g. allow or prevent the usage of certain applications on specific SSIDs. For example, for the SSIDs used for EPC access through S2a over Trusted WLAN, the UE can be configured to disable applications that require local connectivity (e.g. DLNA applications) and enable applications that require EPC connectivity to the default APN used for access through S2a over Trusted WLAN. Such kind of special behavior for SSIDs used for EPC access through S2a over Trusted WLAN can improve the user experience and prolong the UE battery life.\nNOTE:\tA UE can be configured to apply different behavior when connected to different SSIDs by means which are outside the scope of this document.
