            "description": "The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects; Telecommunication management, as identified below:\nTS 32.421:\t\"Subscriber and equipment trace: Trace concepts and requirements\";\nTS 32.422:\t\"Subscriber and equipment trace: Trace control and configuration management\";\nTS 32.423:\t\"Subscriber and equipment trace: Trace data definition and management\";\nSubscriber and equipment trace provide very detailed information at call level on one or more specific mobile(s). \nThis data is an additional source of information to Performance Measurements and allows going further in monitoring and optimisation operations.\nContrary to Performance measurements, which are a permanent source of information, trace is activated on user demand for a limited period of time for specific analysis purposes.\nTrace plays a major role in activities such as determination of the root cause of a malfunctioning mobile, advanced troubleshooting, optimisation of resource usage and quality, RF coverage control and capacity improvement, dropped call analysis, Core Network and Access Network end-to-end procedure validation.\nThe capability to log data on any interface at call level for a specific user (e.g. IMSI) or mobile type (e.g. IMEI or IMEISV), or service initiated by a user allows getting information which cannot be deduced from Performance measurements such as perception of end-user QoS during his call (e.g. requested QoS vs. provided QoS), correlation between protocol messages and RF measurements, or interoperability with specific mobile vendors.\nMoreover, performance measurements provide values aggregated on an observation period; Subscriber and UE Trace give instantaneous values for a specific event (e.g. call, location update, etc.).\nIf performance measurements are mandatory for daily operations, future network planning and primary trouble shooting; Subscriber and UE Trace is the easy way to go deeper into investigation and network optimisation.\nIn order to produce this data, Subscriber and UE Trace are carried out in the NEs, which comprise the network. The data can then be transferred to an external system (e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology, for further evaluation).\n",

            "description": "The present document describes the requirements for the management of Trace and the reporting of Trace data (including FDD mode and TDD mode) across UMTS, EPS or 5G networks as it refers to subscriber tracing (tracing of IMSI or Public User Identity) and equipment tracing (tracing of IMEI or IMEISV). Trace also includes the ability to trace all active calls in a cell or multiple cells (Cell Traffic Trace). The present document also includes the description of Service Level Tracing (tracing of a specific service). It defines the administration of Trace Session activation/deactivation by the  management system, the network or User Equipment (UE) itself via signalling, the generation of Trace results in the Network Elements (NEs) and UE and the transfer of these results to one or more Operations Systems.\nGSM Trace is outside of the scope of this specification (see [7]).\nThe present document also describes the requirements for the management of Minimization of Drive Tests (MDT) across UMTS networks, EPS networks or 5G networks and Radio Link Failure (RLF) and RRC Connection Establishment Failure (RCEF) reporting across EPS networks and 5G networks.\nThe present document is built upon the basic Subscriber and UE Trace concept described in clause 4. \nThe high-level requirements for Trace data, Trace Session activation/deactivation and Trace reporting are defined in clause 5. Clause 5 also contains an overview of use cases for Trace (the use cases are described in Annex A). Clause 6 defines the requirements for managing MDT. Clause 7 defines the requirements for managing RLF and RCEF reports.Trace control and configuration management are described in 3GPP TS 32.422 [2], and Trace data definition and management are described in 3GPP TS 32.423 [3].\nThe present document does not cover any Trace capability limitations within a NE (e.g. maximum number of simultaneous traced mobiles for a given NE) or any functionality related to these limitations (e.g. NE aborting a Trace Session due to resource limitations).\nThe objectives of the Trace specifications are:\na)\tto provide the descriptions for a standard set of Trace and MDT data;\nb)\tto produce a common description of the management technique for Trace, MDT, RLF, and RCEF administration and result reporting;\nc)\tto define a method for the reporting of Trace, MDT, RLF and RCEF results across the management interfaces.\nThe following is beyond the scope of the present document, and therefore the present document does not describe:\n-\ttracing non-Subscriber or non-UE related events within an NE;\n-\ttracing of all possible parties in a multi-party call (although multiple calls related to the IMSI specified in the Trace control and configuration parameters are traceable).\nThe definition of Trace and MDT data is intended to result in comparability of Trace and MDT data produced in a multi-vendor wireless UMTS, EPS and/or 5G network(s), for those Trace control and configuration parameters that can be standardised across all vendors' implementations.\nVendor specific extensions to the Trace control and configuration parameters and Trace and MDT data are discussed in 3GPP TS 32.422 [2] and 3GPP TS 32.423 [3].\nAll functions (trace, MDT etc.) specified in this specification support Network Sharing, with the following conditions:\n-\tIt is accepted that the recorded information from the shared nodes is available to the Primary Operator. Recorded information that is collected in a non shared node or cell will only be available to the operator managing the non shared node or cell.\n-\tIt is accepted that the recorded information from the shared network shall be delivered to the Participating Operator whose PLMN recording is requested, taking user consent into account. Operators must also agree on sharing the information, but how that agreement is done is outside the scope of this specification. The mapping of TCE IP addresses and TCE addresses must be coordinated among the operators that shares the network. How that coordination is done is outside the scope of this specification.\n-\tIt is accepted that the inter-PLMN recorded information for Logged MDT from the non-shared nodes of  Participating Operators may be available to the Primary Operator.\n-\tFor signalling based activation, the operators that share a network must coordinate the TCE IP addresses and the TCE address mapping must be coordinated. How that coordination´ is done is outside the scope of this specification.\nFor UMTS and EPS the 3GPP Managment reference model, 3GPP TS 32.101 [1] is followed.\nFor 5GS the 3GPP Services Based Management Architecture, 3GPP TS 28.533 [20] is followed.\n\n",

Thus, the objective of this TS is not to list an exhaustive set of information to meet all the requirements. Rather, Trace data is defined without any limitation on the 2 following dimensions:\n-\tTrace scope: NEs and signalling interfaces to Trace.\n-\tTrace depth: level of details of Trace data.\nIn order not to have any limitation of Trace data, there are six levels of details defined: Maximum, Minimum, Medium, MaximumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension, MinimumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension and MediumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension. The first three levels allow for vendor specific information to be traced and sent in the trace report file.\nThe Maximum (or MaximumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension) Levels allow all Trace data to be recorded. The other Levels provide a decoded subset of the data in the Maximum Level and allow an operator the flexibility in selecting the appropriate Trace data to record.\nThe Trace Depth, specified at the Trace Session activation, is used to choose the level of detail of information to be retrieved.\nThe Maximum (or MaximumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension) Levels of detail allow for retrieval of signalling interface messages within the Trace Scope in encoded format (see figure 4.1.1).\nFigure 4.1.1 illustrates the maximum (or MaximumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension) levels of detail of a trace, showcasing the intricate network connections and signal flow within a telecommunication system. The figure provides a comprehensive overview of the system's architecture, highlighting the various components such as nodes, switches, and routers that work together to transmit data efficiently. The visual representation of the trace data allows for a better understanding of the system's performance and potential areas for optimization.\nFigure 4.1.1: Maximum (or MaximumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension) Levels of details of Trace\nThe Minimum (or MinimumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension) Levels of detail allow for retrieval of a decoded subset of the IEs contained in the signalling interface messages (see figure 4.1.2).\nFigure 4.1.2 illustrates the minimum (or MinimumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension) levels of detail of a trace, which is a record of network traffic. The figure shows the various components involved in the trace, including the source and destination IP addresses, the protocol used, the packet size, and the timestamp of each packet. This information is essential for network administrators to analyze and troubleshoot network issues, as well as for network security analysts to identify potential threats. The figure also shows the different types of traffic, such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP, and how they are routed through the network. Overall, this figure provides a comprehensive overview of network traffic and its components, which is crucial for network management and security.\nFigure 4.1.2: Minimum (or MinimumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension) Levels of detail of Trace\nThe Medium (or MediumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension) Levels of detail allow for retrieval of the decoded subset of the IEs contained in the signalling interface messages in the Minimum Level plus a selected set of decoded radio measurement IEs.\nThe Trace data recorded at each Level is defined in 3GPP TS 32.423 [3].\n",

For this use case, tracing should be possible in all network elements, such as: HSS, MSS, RNC, MGW, SGSN, GGSN.\n-\tThe identification of the subscriber in a Trace is IMSI in UTRAN/CS/PS. The identification of the UE in a Trace is IMEI or IMEISV.\n-\tThe data includes those Information Elements from the signalling messages, which are related to the service(s) being complained about by the subscriber (Medium Level).\nExample cases, which can be the basis for subscriber complaint:\n1.\tThe subscriber's CS call is misrouted\nThis illustrates an instance where a subscriber complains that his calls are being cross-connected (or misrouted). Such a complaint involves setting up a Trace at all the 3GPP standardised interfaces being handled by the MSC. However, the Trace functionality shall not cover MSC internal or vendor proprietary interfaces. The Trace record shall need to have the dialled number and connected number.\n2.\tThe subscriber's call is dropped\nTracing data is required from the radio network (UTRAN) or from the core network (MSS, SGSN, GGSN). In the radio network the radio coverage shall be checked. See use case #4 (checking radio coverage). Beside the radio coverage, other information can be useful as well, like RLC parameter, power information (OLPC or RRC measurement report), error ratios (BLER / BER, SDU error ratio), etc. Tracing in the core network is needed also, if the problem is not in the radio network. E.g. in case of PS domain the call can be dropped by the application due to the long delays or congestions in TCP layer or due to bad QoS. Thus in SGSN the requested and negotiated QoS parameters should be included in the Trace record.\n3.\tThe received QoS level is less than the negotiated level.\nTo be able to solve the possible problem Tracing data is required from HSS, SGSN, GGSN, and UTRAN. Furthermore in case of problem in CS calls tracing in MGW shall be performed.\nFrom HSS Trace data the operator can monitor whether the subscriber's authentication to the network is successful, and what kind of QoS parameters are allowed to the subscriber. From SGSN Trace data the operator can monitor PDP context creation request from mobile. Request seems to contain legal QoS profile (incl. Maximum bandwidth, guaranteed bandwidth etc) and the local resources in SGSN are available to provide the service as requested by the subscriber. From UTRAN Trace data the operator can monitor whether the maximum bandwidth and guaranteed bandwidth, requested by SGSN, acceptable for UTRAN. Thus to check whether UTRAN can provide and maintain the requested radio access bearer services. From GGSN Trace data the operator can monitor PDP context activation between SGSN and GGSN. If the problem is in the CS domain the MGW Trace can provide the QoS data.\n",

By periodically sampling these network performance data, managers of the operator can monitor overall performance of the network and compare performance differences between areas or periods. The statistical data sampling can be performed periodically e.g. weekly or hly. The drive test fleet’s scale makes the amount of data samples under operators control.\nMDT can be used to replace or reduce drive test in this case. It is necessary for the MDT task to collect measurements in a way similar as the drive test do. To prevent unnecessary waste of network resources, operators need to specify the desired maximum number and amount of data samples collected through an MDT task. There is no need to notify the operator when the max number or amount is reached because that will not trigger any action of the operator.  It is necessary for the operators to specify the desired minimum number of UEs and amount of data samples collected in a MDT job so that the data collected can meet the business and management requirements.

NG-RAN node starts the Trace Session and establishes connection to the Trace data consumer. NG-RAN node and Trace data consumer exchange the Trace data collection session metadata (e.g. identity of the NG-RAN node, nature of the data being collected, Trace Session Reference).\n7.\tWhile the Trace Session is active on the NG-RAN node, NG-RAN node collects the Trace data prescribed by Trace configuration received from the AMF.\n8.\tPeriodically, upon the Trace data availability, the NG-RAN node sends the collected data to the data consumer.
