When the MC service server uses implicit affiliation/de-affiliation for an interworking group defined in the LMR system, the MC service server informs the IWF of the affiliation/de-affiliation.\nThe LMR system may affiliate its group members to an interworking group defined in the MC system via the IWF.\nFor group regroup, the affiliated group members are automatically affiliated to the temporary group.\nThe signalling procedure of interworking group affiliation is described in figure 10.1.2.2-1.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe group to be affiliated to is defined in the MC system.\n2.\tThe IWF is connected to and is authorized to interwork with the MC system.\n3.\tThe interworking group information is available at the IWF.\n4.\tThe mapping relationship of group and user identities between MC system and the LMR system has been configured at the IWF.\nNOTE 1:\tFor all the signalling messages passing through the IWF between the MC system and the LMR system, the IWF performs the identity conversion and protocol translation.\nFigure 10.1.2.2-1 illustrates the process of group affiliation within a Mobile Country Code (MCC) system. The figure depicts the relationship between a group defined in the MC system and the various group affiliations assigned to mobile subscribers. Key elements include the Group Management Entity (GME), Group Management Entity Identifier (GMEI), and the different group affiliations such as Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3. The figure highlights the hierarchical structure of group affiliations and their association with the MC system, providing a comprehensive overview of the mobile subscriber grouping process.\nFigure 10.1.2.2-1: Group affiliation to a group defined in the MC system\n1.\tThe IWF sends an IWF group affiliation request to the MC service server on behalf of the LMR system.\n2a.\tThe MC service server checks if the group policy is locally cached. If the group policy is not locally cached on the MC service server then the MC service server requests the group policy from the group management server.\n2b.\tThe MC service server receives the group policy from the group management server.\n3.\tBased on the group policy, the MC service server checks if the MC service group(s) is not disabled and if the user identified by the MCPTT ID supplied by the IWF is authorised to affiliate to the requested MC service group(s).\n4.\tBased on the group policy and user subscription, the MC service server affiliates the IWF to the group. If a separate affiliation for each LMR user is expected, the status of the affiliating user is stored by the MC service server as the status associated with an MC service ID provided by the IWF that corresponds to the identity of that LMR user. If a separate affiliation for each LMR user is not expected, an affiliation status for the group using the MC service ID provided by the IWF is stored.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server sends the group affiliation status update message to the group management server, the group management server stores and updates the group affiliation status.\n6.\tThe MC service server returns an IWF group affiliation response to the IWF.\nNOTE 2:\tHow the LMR user(s) affiliates to a group is outside the scope of the present document.\nThe signalling procedure of interworking group de-affiliation from a group defined in the MC system is described in figure 10.1.2.3-1.\nThe LMR system manages the individual de-affiliation requests from the LMR users. The LMR system can de-affiliate its group members from the interworking group via the IWF.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe mapping relationship of group and user identities between the MC system and the LMR system has been configured at the IWF.\n2.\tThe affiliation procedure described in subclause 10.1.2.2 was previously performed.\nNOTE 1:\tFor all the signalling messages passing through the IWF between the MC system and the LMR system, the IWF performs the identity conversion and protocol translation.\nFigure 10.1.2.3 -1 depicts the process of a group de-affiliation from a group defined in the MC system. The figure illustrates the steps involved in removing a group from the MC system, including the de-affiliation request, approval, and the subsequent changes to the group's status. The figure highlights the importance of proper coordination and communication between network operators and service providers to ensure a smooth and efficient de-affiliation process.\nFigure 10.1.2.3-1: Group de-affiliation from group defined in the MC system\n1.\tThe IWF sends an IWF group de-affiliation request to the MC service server on behalf of the LMR system.\n2.\tIf a separate de-affiliation from each LMR user is expected and based on the group policy and user subscription, the MC service server may de-affiliate the LMR group member from the group. Further, the MC service server may store the affiliation status of the user(s) for the requested MC service group(s). If a separate de-affiliation from each LMR user is not expected, the de-affiliation signalling de-affiliates the IWF and therefore the entire LMR system from the group.\n3.\tThe MC service server sends the group de-affiliation status update message to the group management server, the group management server stores and updates the group affiliation status.\n4.\tThe MC service server returns an IWF group de-affiliation response to the IWF.\nNOTE 2:\tHow the LMR user(s) de-affiliate from a group is outside the scope of the present document.\nThe MC system may affiliate its group members to an interworking group defined in the LMR system via the IWF.\nThe signalling procedure of group affiliation via the IWF is described in figure 10.1.2.4-1.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe group to be affiliated to is defined in the LMR system.\n2.\tThe IWF is connected to and is authorized to work with the MC system.\n3.\tThe mapping relationship of group and user identities between the MC system and the LMR system has been configured at the IWF.\nNOTE 1:\tFor all signalling messages passing through the IWF between the MC system and the LMR system, the IWF performs the identity conversion and protocol translation.\n\nFigure 10.1.2.4-1 illustrates the hierarchical structure of group affiliations within a Local Mobile Radio (LMR) system. The figure shows how different groups are assigned to a predefined group in the LMR system, with each group represented by a unique identifier. The diagram emphasizes the importance of proper group affiliation for efficient communication and coordination among the various entities within the LMR system. The figure also highlights the role of the LMR system in facilitating seamless communication and collaboration among different groups, ensuring that they can work together effectively and efficiently.\nFigure 10.1.2.4-1: Group affiliation to group defined in the LMR system\n1.\tThe MC service client sends a MC service group affiliation request, including the MC service group ID(s), to the MC service server.\n2.\tThe MC service server checks if the MC service group ID(s) is an interworking group defined in the LMR system.\n3.\tThe MC service server sends an IWF group affiliation request to the IWF.\nNOTE 2:\tThe IWF can forward the request to the LMR system that could check whether the MC service client is authorized to affiliate to this interworking group.\nNOTE 3:\tThe IWF can reject the affiliation if the MC service group ID is either unknown to the IWF or not mapped to an LMR group identity in the IWF configuration.\n4.\tThe IWF returns an IWF group affiliation response to the MC service server, informing the successful affiliation to the LMR group.\n5.\tThe MC service server stores the group affiliation status of the MC service client for the requested interworking group.\n6.\tThe MC service server sends an MC service group affiliation response to the MC service client.\nNOTE 4:\tHow the affiliation is conducted on the LMR system is outside the scope of the present document.\nNOTE 5:\tIf an MC service client is implicitly affiliated to an MC service group defined in the LMR system the MC service server only performs steps 3, 4, and 5.\nThe signalling procedure of interworking group de-affiliation from a group defined in the LMR system is described in figure 10.1.2.5-1.\nThe MC system manages the individual de-affiliation requests from the MC service users.

The figure depicts the hierarchical structure of the LMR system, with various groups and their affiliations. The top-level group is labeled as \"5-1,\" and it is de-affiliated from a lower-level group. The figure shows the flow of information and the changes in affiliations, highlighting the complex network structure and the importance of accurate de-affiliation processes in maintaining system integrity.\nFigure 10.1.2.5-1: Group de-affiliation from a group defined in the LMR system\n1.\tThe MC service client of the MC service user sends an MC service group de-affiliation request to the MC service server.

The IWF will behave on the interface as if it is a peer MC service server with a peer group management client and peer group management server.\nExceptions to the 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] procedures are detailed in the subclauses below.\nThe MC system can initiate a group regroup that includes groups defined at the IWF. The IWF is informed and may reject the regroup if conditions do not allow it to support the regroup. This is described in figure 10.2.2.2-1.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe group management client has retrieved the group configurations of the groups to be regrouped.\n2.\tAt least one MC service group has been defined in the MC system.\n3.\tAt least one MC service group has been defined in the IWF.\nFigure 10.2.2-1 illustrates the process of group regrouping to an Internetworking Working Function (IWF), which is a crucial step in network management. The figure shows how multiple groups are combined and directed towards a specific IWF for further processing. This process is essential for efficient routing and ensuring that network resources are utilized optimally. The figure highlights the hierarchical nature of network management, with IWFs playing a pivotal role in controlling and directing traffic.\nFigure 10.2.2.2-1: Group regrouping to an IWF\n1.\tThe group management client of the MC service user (e.g. dispatcher) requests group regroup operation to the group management server (which is the group management server of one of the MC service groups to be regrouped). The identities of the groups being combined shall be included in this message. The group management client may indicate the security level required for the temporary group. The group management client may indicate the priority level required for the temporary group.\n2.\tThe group management server checks whether group regroup operation is performed by an authorised MC service user, based on group policy. The group management server checks whether the group is a temporary group. If the group is a temporary group, then the group regrouping will be rejected, otherwise the group regrouping can proceed.\n3.\tThe group management server forwards the IWF group regroup request to the IWF with the information about the IWF's groups.\n4.\tThe IWF provides an IWF group regroup response. Due to security aspects concerning sharing information among different MC systems, the IWF does not share the users' information of the groups under its management to the group management server. The IWF may reject the IWF group regroup response. (e.g. if one of its constituent groups is in the emergency state or is already in a regroup, if the IWF does not support temporary groups or the IWF does not support group regrouping)\n5.\tThe group management server creates and stores the information of the temporary group, including the temporary MC service group ID, off-network information, and the MC service IDs of the groups being combined, the priority level of the temporary group, and the security level of the temporary group. If the authorised MC service user does not specify the security level and the priority level, the group management server shall set the lower security level and the higher priority of the constituent groups.\n6.\tThe group management server notifies the IWF about its group regroup operation.\nNOTE:\tHow the IWF uses the MC service group ID that identifies the temporary group is outside the scope of the present document.\n7.\tThe IWF acknowledges the group management server.\n8.\tThe group management server notifies the MC service server of the temporary group creation with the information of the constituent groups.\n9.\tThe MC service server acknowledges the notification from the group management server.\n10.\tThe group management server notifies the MC service group members of the constituent MC service groups of the group management server, possibly with an indication of lower security level.\n11.\tThe group management server provides a group regroup response to the group management client of the authorised MC service user (e.g. dispatcher).\nThe procedure in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] is followed, except for steps 1 and 2. The IWF will behave on the interface as if it is a peer MC service server with a peer group management server. This is described in figure 10.2.2.3-1.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tAt least one MC service group has been defined in the MC system.\n2.\tAt least one MC service group has been defined in the IWF.\nFigure 10 illustrates the process of group regrouping from an Identity and Access Management (IWF) in a network. The figure depicts the IWF, which is responsible for managing and controlling access to network resources, and the groups that are being regrouped. The figure shows how the IWF identifies groups that need to be regrouped and then proceeds to reorganize them, ensuring that access rights are correctly assigned to each group. The figure also highlights the importance of this process in maintaining the security and efficiency of the network.\nFigure 10.2.2.3-1: Group regrouping from an IWF\n1.\tThe IWF sends an IWF group regroup request to the group management server.\n2.\tThe group management server checks whether the group can be included in a temporary group.\n3.\tThe group management server provides an IWF group regroup response.\nNOTE:\tDue to security aspects concerning sharing information among different systems, the group management server does not share the users' information of the groups under its management to the IWF.\n4.\tThe IWF notifies the group management server regarding the temporary group creation with information of the constituent groups.\n5.\tThe group management server notifies the MC service server regarding the temporary group creation with the information of the constituent groups.\n6.\tThe MC service server acknowledges the notification from the group management server. The MC service server may reject the IWF group regroup, e.g. if one of its constituent groups is already in a regroup.\n7.\tThe group management server acknowledges the notification from the IWF.\n8.\tThe group management server notifies the MC service group members of the constituent MC service groups of the group management server, possibly with an indication of a lower security level.\nThe group management server that performs the group regroup operation owns the temporary group created by the regroup, as implied in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5].\nTo prevent routing issues and complexity that could result from regrouping the same users from both sides of the interface, the following rules can be applied:\n-\tIf group regrouping signalling using temporary groups is used on the MC system, the IWF must prevent the regroup signalling from propagating to the LMR system if the LMR system does not support regrouping;\n-\tthe IWF must handle the translation between temporary group identities on the MC system and the original interworking group identities used on the LMR system; and\n-\tthe regrouping rules in subclause 10.2.4.4 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] also apply.\nIf one of the LMR groups to be included in a group regroup requires the use of LMR E2EE the preferred voice codecs for an MCPTT temporary group should be LMR codecs. If any of the mission critical users to be included in this MCPTT temporary group do not support LMR E2EE or the preferred LMR codecs, voice calls using LMR E2EE will fail for those users.\nNOTE 1:\tHow the MC system determines that the temporary group needs to support LMR E2EE is outside the scope of the present document.\nNOTE 2:\tHow the MC system determines that the temporary group needs to support an LMR codec is outside the scope of the present document.\n",

The subclauses 10.3.3.4 and 10.3.3.5 describe the group call setup between the MCPTT system and the LMR system on an interworking group defined in the LMR system. The subclause 10.3.3.7 describes the late entry procedures and subclause 10.3.3.8 describes the group call release procedures. Group calls can use MC media encryption between the IWF and the MCPTT clients as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [8]. A call that uses an LMR vocoder may use LMR E2EE if the calling and called parties have previously been provisioned with the appropriate LMR E2EE keys.\nThe procedures in the present subclause are applicable to the following non-broadcast group call types: pre-configured group regroup calls, pre-configured user regroup calls and group regroup calls.\nNOTE:\tMC media encryption is independent of LMR E2EE techniques. MC media encryption can be applied in addition to LMR E2EE.\nIn this procedure, an MCPTT user is initiating a group call on an interworking group defined in the MCPTT system. The signalling procedure is described in figure 10.3.3.2-1.\nThis subclause is based upon subclause for pre-arranged group call setup in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.6.2.3.1.1.2.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe interworking group information is known at the MCPTT server and the IWF by configuration or group creation. The interworking group has been defined in the MCPTT system.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are registered and their respective users are authenticated and authorized to use the MCPTT service.\n3.\tThe users in this interworking group have been affiliated to the group.\n4.\tThe mapping relationship of group and user identities between the MCPTT system and the LMR system has been configured at the IWF.\nNOTE 1:\tFor all the signalling messages passing through the IWF between the MCPTT system and the LMR system, the IWF performs the identity conversion and protocol translation.\n\n\nFigure 10.3.3.2-1 illustrates the setup of a group call initiated by an MCPTT user on an interworking group defined in the MCPTT system. The figure shows the process of call setup, including the MCPTT user, the interworking group, and the communication between the two. The MCPTT user initiates the call, which is then accepted by the interworking group. The figure also shows the signaling process, including the use of SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) for call setup and tear-down. The figure is a valuable resource for understanding the process of group call setup in an MCPTT system.\nFigure 10.3.3.2-1: Group call setup initiated by MCPTT user on an interworking group defined in MCPTT system\n1.\tMCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates a group call for the selected interworking group identified by MCPTT group ID.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 sends a group call request to the MCPTT server.\n3.\tMCPTT server checks whether the user of MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a group call on the selected interworking group.\n4.\tMCPTT server proceeds group call setup procedures towards the affiliated MCPTT system users as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].\n5.\tMCPTT server sends IWF group call request(s) towards the IWF. If the IWF has affiliated to this group on behalf of the group's LMR users, only one IWF group call request message is sent to the IWF. If the MCPTT server has received individual affiliations from the group's LMR users, an individual IWF group call request is sent (to the IWF) for each affiliated LMR user.\nNOTE 2:\tHow the LMR users are called is outside the scope of the present document.\nNOTE 3:\tSteps 4 and 5 can occur in any order.\n6.\tThe IWF returns IWF group call response(s) to the MCPTT server. If E2EE is specified, then the MCPTT users and the LMR users shall use the same codec. If E2EE is not specified, the MCPTT users and the LMR users can use different codecs and transcoding is needed at the IWF.\n7.\tThe MCPTT server sends group call response to the MCPTT client 1 about successful call establishment.\n8.\tThe group call on the interworking group has successfully established media plane for communication and any user can transmit media. The MCPTT system where the interworking group is defined is the controlling system of the group call and manages the floor control.\nIn this procedure, an LMR user is initiating a group call on an interworking group defined in the MCPTT system. The signalling procedure is described in figure 10.3.3.3-1.\nThis subclause is based upon subclause for pre-arranged group call setup in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.6.2.3.1.1.2.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe interworking group information is known at the MCPTT server and the IWF by configuration or group creation.

The figure depicts the communication process between the LMR user, the MCPTT system, and the associated MCPTT group. The LMR user initiates the call, which is then received by the MCPTT system. The MCPTT system routes the call to the appropriate MCPTT group, ensuring that all group members receive the communication. The figure highlights the seamless integration of LMR and MCPTT systems, enabling efficient and reliable communication in critical situations.\nFigure 10.3.3.3-1: Group call initiated by LMR user on an interworking group defined in MCPTT system\n1.\tThe IWF sends an IWF group call request to the MCPTT server for call establishment.

The IWF transcodes the voice to a LMR codec. If needed, the IWF re-encrypts the transcoded voice media using LMR security procedures (these are out-of-scope of this specification), and forwards the voice media to the LMR system.\nNOTE:\tWhere transcoding occurs is outside the scope of this specification. In this procedure, it is assumed to take place internal to the IWF.\n5.\tSometime later the floor becomes idle.\n6.\tThe LMR system (represented by the IWF in figure 10.3.3.6-1) requests and is granted the floor.\n7.\tThe IWF has been given the floor and is transmitting voice media.\n8.\tThe IWF receives voice media from the LMR system. If the voice media is encrypted, the IWF decrypts the voice media using LMR security procedures (these are out-of-scope of this specification). The IWF transcodes the voice to the group's MCPTT codec. The IWF re-encrypts the transcoded voice using the procedures in 3GPP TS 33.180 [8].\n9.\tThe IWF forwards the voice media to the MCPTT server.\n10.\tThe MCPTT server forwards the voice media to other participants in the group call.\nLate Entry for an ongoing interworking group call is triggered by a successful group affiliation procedure from the participating system.\nNOTE:\tThese procedures apply to all types of group calls, including, for example, emergency call, imminent peril call and broadcast call.\nIn this procedure, the group affiliation from IWF triggers a late entry procedure in the MCPTT system. The signalling procedure is described in figure 10.3.3.7.2-1.\nFor the first affiliating LMR user, this procedure is applicable for both IWF affiliation options (see subclauses 10.1.2.1 and 10.3.1). For the following LMR users affiliating to the same group, this procedure is triggered only if the IWF passes through individual affiliations for each group member.\nThis subclause is based upon subclauses in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] for:\n-\tLate entry for pre-arranged group call, subclause 10.6.2.3.1.1.4, and\n-\tGroup call for an MCPTT group defined in partner MCPTT system, subclause 10.6.2.4.3.1.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe interworking group information is known at the MCPTT server and the IWF by configuration or group creation.

If the MCPTT server has received individual affiliations from the group's LMR users, an individual IWF group-broadcast group call response is sent (to the MCPTT server) for each affiliated LMR user.\n6.\tThe MCPTT server sends a group-broadcast group call release response indicating to the initiator that the call is now ended.\nWhen the call originator has completed transmitting, the group-broadcast group call is ended and the resources are released.\nFigure 10.3.4.5-1 illustrates the procedure for group-broadcast group call release (the group-broadcast group defined in the LMR system).\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tAn on-going group-broadcast group call involving MCPTT client 1, the MCPTT client 2 and the IWF exists.\nFigure 10.3.4.5 - 1: Group-broadcast group call transmission ended (group-broadcast group defined in the LMR system) illustrates the process of a group-broadcast group call transmission in a LMR system. The figure shows the initiation of the call, with the group-broadcast group being defined and the call being initiated. The call is then transmitted through the LMR system, with the group-broadcast group being received by the intended recipients. The figure also shows the end of the call, with the group-broadcast group call transmission being ended.\nFigure 10.3.4.5-1: Group-broadcast group call transmission ended (group-broadcast group defined in the LMR system)\n1.\tThe MCPTT user on MCPTT client 1 finished transmitting.\n2.\tA group-broadcast group call release request is sent to the MCPTT server.\n3.\tAs the group-broadcast group is defined in the LMR system the MCPTT server sends an IWF group-broadcast group call release request to the IWF.\n4.\tThe IWF sends an IWF group-broadcast group call release request to the MCPTT server hosting client 2. The MCPTT server sends the group-broadcast group call release request to MCPTT client 2.\n5.\tMCPTT client 2 is notified that the group-broadcast group call has ended.\nNOTE:\tHow LMR user(s) is(are) notified that the group-broadcast group call has ended is outside the scope of the present document.\n6.\tMCPTT client 2 responds to confirm the release of the group-broadcast group call by sending a group-broadcast group call release response.\n7.\tThe MCPTT server sends an IWF group-broadcast group call release response to the IWF. The IWF becomes aware that MCPTT client 2 has confirmed the group-broadcast group call release and replies with another IWF group-broadcast group call release response back to the MCPTT server to trigger step 8.\n8.\tThe MCPTT server sends a group-broadcast group call release response indicating to the initiator that the group-broadcast group call is now ended.\nThe temporary group created using a pre-configured group can be a broadcast group or a non-broadcast group.\nA broadcast group regroup call using pre-configured groups can be achieved by first regrouping users into a pre-configured group regroup, making the broadcast group call on the pre-configured group, and then cancelling the pre-configured group regroup.\nThe broadcast group regroup call procedure using pre-configured group allows an authorized MCPTT user to initiate a broadcast call to a set of MCPTT groups, which are regrouped only for the duration of the broadcast call. The regroup is cancelled at the end of the broadcast call to prevent users from talking back on the pre-configured group regroup. This procedure requires that the authorized MCPTT user is a group member of at least one of the MCPTT groups included in the regroup operation.\nFigure 10.3.4.6.2-1 illustrates the procedure to initiate a broadcast group regroup call using a pre-configured MCPTT regroup group owned by the MCPTT system. For simplicity, no receiving clients are shown.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe MCPTT client is registered with the MCPTT service.\n-\tThe MCPTT group identity and group configuration for the pre-configured group regroup have been pre-configured in the MCPTT client and the IWF. The MCPTT client and the IWF have received the relevant security related information to allow them to communicate in the pre-configured group regroup.\n-\tThe MCPTT client is authorized to initiate a pre-configured group regroup using the pre-configured group regroup procedure.\n-\tThe MCPTT client is aware of a suitable pre-configured group whose configuration has been pre-configured in the IWF and the MC service UEs of the MCPTT users who will be regrouped.\n-\tThe MCPTT client is affiliated to group 1.\n-\tThe IWF is affiliated to one or more of MCPTT group 1, 2 or 3.\n-\tThe pre-configured group regroup is homed in the MCPTT server.\n-\tThe IWF is home to at least one group that's a constituent group of the pre-configured group regroup.\n\n\nFigure 10.3.4.6 .2-1 illustrates the process of regrouping a broadcast group using a pre-configured group in a Mobile Communication Public Safety (MCPTT) system. The figure shows the MCPTT system's architecture, with various components such as the MCPTT server, MCPTT client, and the MCPTT network. The MCPTT server manages the MCPTT client connections and handles the regrouping process, ensuring efficient communication among the group members. The pre-configured group simplifies the regrouping process, allowing for quick and easy adjustments to the group's structure. This feature enhances the overall functionality and flexibility of the MCPTT system, enabling public safety personnel to adapt to changing communication needs in real-time.\nFigure 10.3.4.6.2-1: Broadcast group regroup call using pre-configured group in the MCPTT system\n1.\tThe authorized user of the MCPTT client initiates the pre-configured group regroup formation procedure using pre-configured groups as specified in subclause 10.3.7.1.

For LMR systems that do not support the concept of chat groups, the IWF might still adapt its calls to the MCPTT chat model.\nIn this procedure, an MCPTT user initiates a chat group call in an interworking group defined in the LMR system. The signalling procedure is described in figure 10.3.5.2-1.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe interworking group information is known at the MCPTT server and the IWF by configuration or group creation.

The figure showcases the seamless integration of the MCPTT system with the existing LMR infrastructure, enabling efficient communication between users. Key components include the MCPTT user equipment (UE), the LMR system, and the interworking group, which facilitates the exchange of information between the two systems. The diagram highlights the real-time nature of the communication, emphasizing the importance of quick and reliable data exchange in emergency situations.\nFigure 10.3.5.2-1: MCPTT user initiated chat group call in an interworking group defined in the LMR system\n1.\tMCPTT user of the MCPTT client indicates to join the group communication for the group. The MCPTT client joins the group by sending a group join request to the MCPTT server. If there is a request to transmit, then the group join request contains an indication of an implicit floor request and the location of the joining party if required.\n2.\tThe MCPTT server inspects the Group join request for presence of location information of the calling party.  If location information is included in the join request, the MCPTT server checks the privacy policy (authorisation to provide location information to other MCPTT users on a call when talking, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] Annex A.3) of the requesting MCPTT user to decide if the user's location information may be provided to other MCPTT users on the call and the IWF.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server notices that the interworking group is defined in the LMR system and forwards the group join request with or without location depending on the outcome of the privacy check as an IWF group join request to the IWF.\n4.\tThe IWF replies with an IWF group join response indicating the acceptance of the group join request and also returns the IWF selected media parameters for the chat group call in the IWF group join response.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server forwards the IWF group join response to the MCPTT client as a group join response.\n6.\tIf the MCPTT client requests to transmit, the MCPTT server establishes the media plane (if not already established) for the call.\n7.\tFloor control will continue to be used by the floor participants associated with the MCPTT client and the IWF for the duration of the call.

If one of the MCPTT groups that has been requested for regrouping by means of this procedure has already been regrouped by the group regrouping procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] or subclause 10.2.2, the request for regrouping shall be rejected. The rules for regrouping set forth in subclause 10.2.2.5 apply.\nFigure 10.3.7.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure to initiate a regroup procedure using a pre-configured MCPTT regroup group, where at least one of the groups to be regrouped is configured in the IWF. The group management server in the MCPTT system of the regroup group shares the necessary security related parameters together with the group configuration of the pre-configured group regroup with the group management server in the IWF; the MCPTT system does not need to be aware of the group members of the pre-configured group regroup that are receiving service in the IWF.\nThe procedure takes place prior to the establishment of a group call to the pre-configured group regroup.\nIn this procedure, any gateway MC servers between the IWF and the MCPTT system are not shown.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe MCPTT client is authorized to initiated a pre-configured group regroup procedure, and is receiving MCPTT service in the MCPTT system.\n-\tThe MCPTT group identity and group configuration for the pre-configured group regroup have been pre-configured in the IWF, and the IWF has received the relevant security related information to allow communication in the pre-configured group regroup.\n-\tIn order to be aware whether the group is regrouped, the MCPTT server is subscribed to the group configuration in GMS.\n-\tThe GMS has subscribed group dynamic data as specified in subclause 10.1.5.5.1 from the MCPTT server within the same MCPTT system using the procedures defined in subclause 10.1.5.6 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5].\n-\tThe IWF is affiliated to one or more of the MCPTT groups that will be regrouped; and/or, the IWF may own one or more of MCPTT groups to be regrouped.\n-\tThe pre-configured group regroup is homed in the MCPTT server.\n-\tThe IWF is home to at least one group that's a constituent group of the pre-configured group regroup.\nNOTE 1:\tThe IWF has the configuratiton information contained in the pre-configured group regroup, which is normally because at least one member of the pre-configured group regroup is homed on the IWF.\nFigure 10.3.7.2.1-1 illustrates the regroup procedure using a pre-configured group initiated in the MCPTT system. The figure depicts the process of dispatchers and subscribers regrouping in a group within the MCPTT system. The MCPTT system is a mission-critical push-to-talk (MCPTT) over broadband system that provides secure, reliable, and efficient communication for public safety and first responders. The figure shows the MCPTT system's architecture, including the MCPTT server, MCPTT client, and the MCPTT group. The MCPTT server manages the MCPTT client connections and handles the group management, while the MCPTT client communicates with the MCPTT server and the MCPTT group. The MCPTT group is a virtual group of dispatchers and subscribers that can be created and managed by the MCPTT server. The figure also shows the process of regrouping, which allows dispatchers and subscribers to re-establish communication with each other within the group. This process is crucial for maintaining effective communication during emergency situations.\nFigure 10.3.7.2.1-1: Regroup procedure using pre-configured group initiated in the MCPTT system\n1.\tThe authorized user of the MCPTT client initiates the pre-configured group regroup procedure, specifying the list of MCPTT groups to be regrouped including MCPTT group 1, the MCPTT group ID of the pre-configured group regroup and the MCPTT group ID of the group from which configuration information for the pre-configured group regroup is to be taken.\n2.\tThe MCPTT client sends the pre-configured regroup request to the MCPTT server.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server checks that the MCPTT client is authorized to initiate a pre-configured group regroup procedure, and resolves the group identities of the MCPTT groups requested in step 1. The MCPTT server also checks which group members are affiliated to the requested MCPTT groups that are homed in the MCPTT system. The MCPTT server identifies any partner systems or IWFs which are the group home systems for MCPTT groups identified in the list of groups to be regrouped. The MCPTT server may retrieve the configuration for the regroup group from the GMS if that configuration information is not already known to the MCPTT server.\nNOTE 2:\tThis procedure does not require that that the authorized user of the MCPTT client is a group member of the MCPTT groups listed in the pre-configured group regroup request, or that the authorized user of the MCPTT client is an affiliated group member of any of the listed MCPTT groups.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server sends an IWF pre-configured regroup requests to the IWF.\nNOTE 3:\tOnly group members that are affiliated to the MCPTT groups that are to be regrouped are sent a pre-configured regroup request.\n5.\tThe IWF sends an IWF pre-configured regroup response to the MCPTT server. The IWF may reject the IWF group regroup response. (e.g. if one of its constituent groups is in the emergency state or is already in a regroup, if the IWF does not support temporary groups or the IWF does not support group regrouping)\n6.\tThe MCPTT server sends the pre-configured regroup response to the MCPTT client.\nAfter the pre-configured group regrouping procedure, the regrouping remains in effect until explicitly cancelled by the procedure in subclause 10.3.7.3.\nParticipation by the IWF in the ongoing pre-configured group regroup persists until the IWF is no longer affiliated to any of the regrouped groups.\nFigure 10.3.7.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure to initiate a pre-configured group regroup procedure using a pre-configured MCPTT group, where at least one of the groups to be regrouped is configured in an MCPTT system. The group management server in the IWF shares the necessary security related parameters together with the group configuration of the MCPTT regroup group with the group management server in the MCPTT system and the group management server in the MCPTT system distributes this configuration including those security parameters to its served MCPTT users according to the procedures in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] subclause 10.2.7; the IWF does not need to be aware of the list of group members of the pre-configured group regroup that are receiving service in the MCPTT system. The group can have multiple MCPTT clients, but only one MCPTT client involved in the session is shown for simplicity.\nThe procedure takes place prior to the establishment of a group call to the pre-configured group regroup.\nIn this procedure, any gateway MC servers between the IWF and the MCPTT system are not shown.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe MCPTT client is an affiliated member of MCPTT group 1 where MCPTT group 1 is defined in the MCPTT system.\n-\tThe MCPTT group identity and group configuration for the pre-configured group regroup have been pre-configured in the MCPTT client, and the MCPTT client has received the relevant security related information to allow communication in the pre-configured group regroup.\n-\tThe pre-configured group regroup is homed in the IWF.\n-\tThe MCPTT system is home to at least one group that's a constituent group of the pre-configured group regroup.\nNOTE 1:\tThe MCPTT system has the configuratiton information contained in the pre-configured group, which is normally because at least one member of the preconfigured group is homed on the MCPTT system.\nFigure 10.3.7.2.2-1 illustrates the regroup procedure using a pre-configured group initiated in the IWF, showcasing the process of reassembling a group of users into a new group. The figure depicts the interaction between the IWF, RADIUS server, and the network elements involved in the regrouping process. Key components include the IWF, which serves as the central controller, and the RADIUS server, which handles authentication and accounting. The figure highlights the importance of efficient group management in network operations, ensuring seamless user mobility and optimal resource allocation.\"\nFigure 10.3.7.2.2-1: Regroup procedure using pre-configured group initiated in the IWF\n1.\tThe IWF initiates the pre-configured group regroup procedure, specifying the list of MCPTT groups to be regrouped including MCPTT group 1, the MCPTT group ID of the pre-configured group regroup and the MCPTT group ID of the group from which configuration information for the pre-configured group regroup is to be taken. The IWF sends the IWF pre-configured regroup request to the MCPTT server in the partner MCPTT system.\n2.\tThe MCPTT server checks the status of any MCPTT groups hosted by itself, and identifies affiliated group members of any of the identified MCPTT groups (both MCPTT groups that are hosted in the MCPTT system and MCPTT groups that are hosted in the IWF) that are receiving MCPTT service in the MCPTT system, which includes the MCPTT client.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server sends a pre-configured regroup request to the MCPTT client.\nNOTE 2:\tOnly group members that are affiliated to the MCPTT groups that are to be regrouped are sent a pre-configured regroup request.\n4.\tThe MCPTT client notifies the user of the regrouping.\n5.\tThe MCPTT client 2 may send the pre-configured regroup response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the regrouping action. This acknowledgement is not sent in response to a multicast transmission of the pre-configured regroup request.\n6.\tThe MCPTT server affiliates the regrouped MCPTT client to the pre-configured group regroup.\n7.\tThe MCPTT server sends an IWF pre-configured regroup response to the IWF.\nAfter the pre-configured group regrouping procedure, the regrouping remains in effect until explicitly cancelled by the procedure in subclause 10.3.7.3.\nMCPTT client participation in the ongoing pre-configured group regroup persists until the MCPTT client is no longer affiliated to any of the regrouped groups.\nMCPTT client affiliation to the pre-configured group regroup may cease when the clients MCPTT service ceases, e.g. when the UE is powered down, or by the client performing a log-off operation.\nFigure 10.3.7.3.1-1 illustrates the procedure to cancel a regrouping that uses a pre-configured MCPTT regroup group where there the regroup had been initiated in the MCPTT system.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe IWF has been regrouped into the pre-configured group regroup.\n-\tThe MCPTT client is authorized to cancel a pre-configured group regroup.\n-\tThe GMS has subscribed to the group dynamic data specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] subclause 10.1.5.5.1 from the MCPTT server as specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] subclause 10.1.5.6.\nFigure 10.3.7.3.1 -1 illustrates the process of regroup cancellation using pre-configured groups in a Mobile Communication Public Safety (MCPTT) system. The figure depicts the MCPTT system, which includes the MCPTT core network, MCPTT client, and the MCPTT application. The MCPTT core network is responsible for routing calls and managing the communication between the MCPTT client and the MCPTT application. The MCPTT client is the device that the public safety personnel use to communicate with the MCPTT application. The MCPTT application is the software that runs on the MCPTT client and handles the communication with the MCPTT core network.\n\nThe figure shows how the MCPTT system uses pre-configured groups to facilitate group communication. When a group is initiated in the MCPTT system, the MCPTT core network automatically assigns a unique identifier to the group. This identifier is then used to route calls and messages to and from the group. The figure also shows how the MCPTT system uses regroup cancellation to ensure that calls and messages are only sent to the intended group members. This is done by using a process called \"group initiated in the MCPTT system\" to automatically remove any group members who are no longer part of the group\nFigure 10.3.7.3.1-1: Regroup cancellation using pre-configured group initiated in the MCPTT system\n1.\tThe authorized user of the MCPTT client initiates the cancellation of the pre-configured group regroup.\n2.\tThe MCPTT client sends the pre-configured regroup cancel request to the MCPTT server, specifying the MCPTT group ID of the regroup group.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server checks that the MCPTT client is authorized to cancel a pre-configured group regroup.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server sends the IWF pre-configured regroup cancel request to the IWF.\n5.\tThe IWF sends the IWF pre-configured regroup cancel response to the MCPTT server.

The figure depicts the various stages of the call setup, including the initial call request, call establishment, and connection to the network. Key components such as the MCPTT user equipment (UE), the network core, and the service control point (SCP) are shown, highlighting the role of each entity in the process. The figure emphasizes the importance of rapid and reliable communication in mission-critical situations, showcasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the MCPTT system.\nFigure 10.4.2.1-1: Private call setup in automatic commencement mode, initiated by an MCPTT user\n1.\tThe MCPTT user at the MCPTT client initiates an MCPTT private call. The MCPTT client sends an MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT server. The MCPTT private call request contains the MCPTT IDs corresponding to the calling MCPTT party and called LMR party and an SDP offer containing one or more media types. If available, the MCPTT user at the MCPTT client may also include a functional alias. The following parameters are also included that describe the MCPTT client's choices:\n-\tthe encryption algorithm;\n-\tthe encryption mode (encrypted or not);\n-\tan indication of whether the MCPTT client is requesting the floor, and if the MCPTT client is requesting the floor, location information of the calling MCPTT client may be provided;\n-\trequested commencement mode (automatic in this case); and\n-\tan indication of whether the call is to be full or half duplex (whether to establish floor control).\n2.\tThe MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user at the MCPTT client is authorized to initiate the private call and whether the provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been activated for the user. Because the IWF private call request is requesting automatic commencement mode, the MCPTT server also checks whether the MCPTT user at the MCPTT client is authorized to initiate a call in automatic commencement mode. If location information was included in the MCPTT private call request, the MCPTT server also checks the privacy policy (authorisation to provide location information to other MCPTT users on a call when talking, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] Annex A.3) of the requesting MCPTT user to decide if the user's location information may be provided to other MCPTT users on the call and the IWF.\n3.\tIf authorized, the MCPTT server sends the IWF private call request that may or may not include location of the requestor, depending on the outcome of the privacy check towards the IWF, including the original parameters and offering the same media types or a subset of the media types contained in the initial received request as per 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].\nNOTE:\tHow the IWF private call request is forwarded to the LMR system is out of scope of the present document.\n4.\tThe IWF sends an IWF private call response to the MCPTT server, indicating that the IWF does support one of the requested media types.

If the indication is failure, the response may include one or more alternatives to the parameter values contained in step 3.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server forwards the MCPTT private call response to the MCPTT client. If the result parameter indicates success, then the MCPTT client proceeds to step 6. Otherwise, if the parameters returned in the MCPTT private call response are acceptable to the MCPTT client, then the MCPTT client can send a new MCPTT private call request with the new parameters and behaves according to those parameters. The calling MCPTT user may be notified of the change in parameters, for example, that the call is to be without floor control. The MCPTT user can choose to end the call rather than continue with the new parameters. If the parameters returned are not acceptable to the MCPTT client, then the call fails.\n6.\tThe MCPTT client has successfully established media plane for communication to the IWF and either end can transmit media. The MCPTT system initiating the call is responsible of granting the floor, solving competing floor requests and issuing floor revoked indications.\nIn this procedure, an LMR user is initiating a private call (in automatic commencement mode) for communicating with a user in MCPTT system, with or without floor control enabled.\nThis subclause is based on the procedure for private call setup in automatic commencement mode – MCPTT users in multiple MCPTT systems described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.7.2.3.1.\nIn figure 10.4.2.2-1, an LMR user initiates establishment of a private call with an MCPTT user.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe calling LMR user has selected automatic commencement mode for the call;\n2.\tThe MCPTT client is registered to the MCPTT service, as per procedure in subclause 10.2 in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].\n3.\tThe LMR user at the LMR system has initiated a private call towards an MCPTT user.\n4.\tOptionally, LMR user may use an activated functional alias (homed in the MCPTT system) for the call.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server has subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\nNOTE 1:\tPrivate call operation between the LMR user and the IWF are out of scope of the present document.\nNOTE 2:\tThe mapping between alternative addressing schemes of the LMR user and the corresponding functional alias is out of scope of the present document.\nFigure 10.4.2.2-1 illustrates the process of a private call setup in automatic commencement mode, initiated by an LMR (Land Mobile Radio) user. The figure depicts the various stages of call setup, including the initial call request, signal transmission, and successful call completion. Key components such as the LMR user equipment (LMR-UEs), the Automatic Call Setup (ACS) server, and the Automatic Number Identification (ANI) server are highlighted. The figure emphasizes the seamless transition from call initiation to completion, ensuring efficient communication in emergency and critical situations.\nFigure 10.4.2.2-1: Private call setup in automatic commencement mode, initiated by an LMR user\n1.\tThe IWF sends an IWF private call request towards the MCPTT server.

If the parameters returned are not acceptable to the IWF, then the call fails. If the parameters returned in the IWF private call response are different but acceptable to the IWF, then the IWF can send a new IWF private call request with the new parameters starting with step 1, which is to essentially restart the call.

If location information was included in the MCPTT private call request, the MCPTT server also checks the privacy policy (authorisation to provide location information to other MCPTT users on a call when talking, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] Annex A.3) of the requesting MCPTT user to decide if the user's location information may be provided to other MCPTT users on the call and the IWF.\n3.\tIf authorized, the MCPTT server sends the IWF private call request towards the IWF, including the original parameters that may or may not include location of the requestor, depending on the outcome of the privacy check, and offering the same media types or a subset of the media types contained in the initial received request as per 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].\nNOTE:\tHow the IWF private call request is forwarded to the LMR system is out of scope of the present document.\n4.\tThe IWF may report failure with an IWF private call response to the MCPTT server. The response may include one or more alternatives to the parameter values contained in step 3. If the IWF does not report failure, the process proceeds with step 6.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server forwards the MCPTT private call response to the MCPTT client. If the result parameter indicates failure, the MCPTT client may abandon the call. If the parameters in the MCPTT private call response are acceptable to the MCPTT client, then the MCPTT client can send a new MCPTT private call request with the new parameters to the MCPTT server and behaves according to those parameters. The calling user may be notified of the change in parameters, for example, that the call is to be without floor control. The calling user may choose to end the call rather than continue with the new parameters.\n6.\tThe receiving IWF sends an IWF ringing to the MCPTT server while waiting for the call to be accepted.\n7.\tThe MCPTT server forwards the MCPTT ringing to the MCPTT client. The MCPTT client may indicate to the MCPTT user that the LMR user has been notified, e.g. by producing ringback audio.\n8.\tOnce the call has been accepted by the called user, the IWF sends an IWF private call response to the MCPTT server. The IWF private call response indicates that the IWF does support one of the requested media types.\n9.\tThe MCPTT server forwards the MCPTT private call response to the MCPTT client. The MCPTT client may indicate to the MCPTT user that the call is connected, e.g. by stopping the ringback audio.\n10.\tThe MCPTT client has successfully established media plane for communication to the IWF. The MCPTT system initiating the call is responsible of granting the floor and solving the competing floor requests, and floor revoked indications.\nIn this procedure, an LMR user is initiating a private call (in manual commencement mode) for communicating with an MCPTT user via an IWF, with or without floor control enabled.\nThis subclause is based on the procedure for private call setup in manual commencement mode – MCPTT users in multiple MCPTT systems described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.7.2.3.2.\nIn figure 10.4.3.2-1, an LMR user initiates establishment of a private call with an MCPTT user.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe calling LMR user has selected manual commencement mode for the call.\n2.\tThe MCPTT client is registered to the MCPTT service, as per procedure in subclause 10.2 in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].\n3.\tThe LMR user at the LMR system has initiated a private call towards an MCPTT user.\n4.\tOptionally, LMR user may use an activated functional alias (homed in the MCPTT system) for the call.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server has subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\nNOTE 1:\tPrivate call operation between the LMR user and the IWF are out of scope of the present document.\nNOTE 2:\tThe mapping between alternative addressing schemes of the LMR user and the corresponding functional alias is out of scope of the present document\nFigure 10.4.3.2-1 illustrates the process of a private call setup in manual commencement mode, initiated by an LMR (Land Mobile Radio) user.

Within the context of interworking between MCPTT and LMR systems, this condition can occur due to both MCPTT and LMR users obtaining the floor simultaneously, or the floor granted to an LMR user is taken by an MCPTT user.\nFigure 10.5.4-1 shows the high-level procedure where an MCPTT session is already established between the floor participants (with floor granted to an LMR user represented by the IWF) and the floor control server (with an override based on priority and configured to permit the transmission of overridden floor participant from the IWF). The group is defined in the MCPTT system and the MCPTT Server is the floor control server. Only two UEs involved in the session are shown for simplicity.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCPTT floor control server has been configured to support override.\n2.\tThe override supported in this case permits both the overridden floor participant and the overriding floor participant to be transmitting.\n3.\tAn MCPTT session is established between an MCPTT client, the interworked system, and MCPTT server.\n4.\tSession is ongoing.\nFigure 10.5.4 -1 illustrates the floor override feature during an interworking session, where a signal that would otherwise be blocked by a floor transmitter continues to transmit. This is achieved through a specific protocol that allows signals to pass through the floor transmitter, ensuring uninterrupted communication. The figure depicts the signal path, highlighting the interaction between the base station, the floor transmitter, and the mobile station. The key components include the base station, the mobile station, and the floor transmitter, which are essential for enabling seamless communication even when signals are obstructed by physical barriers.\nFigure 10.5.4-1: Floor override (overridden continues to transmit) during an interworking session\n1.\tIt is assumed that the floor participant B (represented by the IWF in figure 10.5.4-1) has been given the floor and is transmitting voice media.\n2.\tFloor participant A, having a floor priority which is relatively higher than that of floor participant B, wants to send voice media over the session.\n3.\tFloor participant A sends a floor request message to the floor control server.\n4.\tThe floor control server determines to accept the floor request from floor participant A based on arbitration result e.g., according to the floor priority information that is received in the floor request message.\n5a.\tFloor control server responds with a floor granted message to floor participant A.\n5b.\tFloor control server sends a floor taken message to the other floor participants (via the IWF). Floor participant B continues transmitting the (overridden) voice media transmission.\nNOTE 1:\tAll other floor participants (not shown) that are part of this group call receive a floor taken message, so that the other floor participants learn who the newly granted talker (overriding) is.\n6a.\tThe floor granted causes the user of floor participant A to be notified.\n6b.\tFloor participant B cannot be notified of the status because it is unable to receive the message and continues transmitting.\n7.\tFloor participant A (overriding) starts sending voice media over the session established beforehand.\nNOTE 2:\tFloor participant B is still sending voice (overridden). The list of floor participants that receive the overriding, overridden, or both transmissions is based on configuration.\nNOTE 3:\tWhen floor participant A stops transmitting, if floor participant B is still sending voice, then the floor is granted back to floor participant B and audio is routed to all current floor participants.\n",

The figure shows the process of establishing a secure communication channel between the LMR user and the MCPTT system, ensuring seamless interoperability between legacy and modern communication networks. The diagram highlights the role of the MCPTT system in providing critical communication services, while also enabling the integration of LMR devices into existing public safety networks. Key components include the LMR user, MCPTT system, and interworking group, which facilitate the exchange of information and enable efficient collaboration during emergency situations.\nFigure 10.6.2.2.1-1: Emergency group call setup, initiated by LMR user on an interworking group defined in the MCPTT system\n1.\tThe IWF sends an IWF emergency group call request including a MCPTT group ID to the MCPTT server. The request contains an indication of the MCPTT emergency. The IWF may indicate in its request that an MCPTT emergency alert is to be sent when initiating an MCPTT emergency group call. The request may contain an indication of an implicit floor request.\n2.\tThe MCPTT server implicitly affiliates the MCPTT ID of the LMR user to the MCPTT emergency group if the user is not already affiliated. If the IWF is configured to affiliate on behalf of all of its group members in a single affiliation step, the MC service server affiliates the IWF instead of an individual MC service ID.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT ID of the LMR user is authorized for initiation of MCPTT emergency calls on the indicated MCPTT group. If authorized, it resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that MCPTT group and their affiliation status.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for all MCPTT participants in the MCPTT group. All successive calls during the MCPTT group's in-progress emergency state will receive the adjusted bearer priority.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server records the emergency state of the group. Once an MCPTT emergency call has been initiated, the MCPTT group is in an in-progress emergency state until that state is cancelled.\nNOTE 3:\tThe IWF actions for priority are out of scope of the present document.\n6.\tMCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call request towards the MCPTT clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members as defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].\n7.\tIf the group has other affiliated LMR users than the calling party and the MCPTT server has received individual affiliations from those LMR users, an individual IWF emergency group call request is sent (to the IWF) for each affiliated LMR user.\n8.\tThe IWF returns IWF emergency group call response(s) to the MCPTT server.\n9.\tThe MCPTT server sends the IWF emergency group call response to the IWF (as a response to the request received in step 1) to inform of the successful MCPTT emergency group call establishment.\nNOTE 4:\tHow the LMR group members are called within the LMR system is out scope of the present document.\nNOTE 5:\tStep 9 can occur at any time following step 5, but at the latest following step 8 depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.\n10.\tThe LMR users via the IWF and the affiliated MCPTTs have successfully established media plane for communication. The MCPTT system where the interworking group is defined is the controlling system of the group call.\nFigure 10.6.2.2.2-1 shows the procedure for an emergency group call setup initiated by a user in the MCPTT system. The figure is based upon the figure for emergency group call in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7], subclause 10.6.2.6.1.1.

The MCPTT user initiates the call, which is then received by the MCPTT system. The interworking group is responsible for routing the call to the appropriate participants. The figure also shows the various communication paths used, including the MCPTT network and the interworking group. The figure provides a clear overview of the setup and communication process for an emergency group call in a MCPTT system.\nFigure 10.6.2.2.2-1: Emergency group call setup, initiated by MCPTT user on an interworking group defined in the MCPTT system\n1.\tAn MCPTT user initiates an emergency group call. MCPTT client 1 sets its MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state is retained until explicitly cancelled.\n2.\tThe MCPTT client sends an MCPTT emergency group call request to the MCPTT server. The request contains an indication of the MCPTT emergency. The MCPTT client may indicate in its request that an MCPTT emergency alert is to be sent when initiating an MCPTT emergency group call. The request may contain an indication of an implicit floor request.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server implicitly affiliates MCPTT client 1 to the emergency group if the client is not already affiliated.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user of the MCPTT client 1 is authorized for initiation of MCPTT emergency calls on the indicated interworking group. If authorized, it resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that MCPTT group and their affiliation status.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for all participants in the MCPTT group.\nNOTE 4:\tSuccessive calls during the group's in-progress emergency state will all receive the adjusted bearer priority.\n6.\tThe MCPTT server records the in-progress emergency state of the group. The MCPTT server also records the identity of the MCPTT user that initiated the MCPTT emergency group call until the MCPTT emergency is cancelled. Once an MCPTT emergency group call has been initiated, the MCPTT group is considered to be in an in-progress emergency state until that state is cancelled.\n7.\tThe MCPTT server sends an IWF emergency group call request to IWF. If the IWF has affiliated to this group on behalf of the group's LMR users, only one IWF emergency group call request message is sent to the IWF. If the MCPTT server has received individual affiliations from the group's LMR users, an individual IWF emergency group call request is sent (to the IWF) for each affiliated LMR user.\n8.\tIWF responds with the IWF emergency group call response(s) to MCPTT server to inform of the successful MCPTT emergency call establishment.\nNOTE 5:\tHow the LMR group members are called within the LMR system is out of scope of the present document.\nNOTE 6:\tSteps 7 to 8 can occur at any time between steps 5 and 10.\nNOTE 7:\tIWF actions for priority are out of scope of the present document.\n9.\tThe MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call request towards the MCPTT clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members as defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].\n10.\tThe MCPTT server sends an MCPTT emergency group call response to the MCPTT client to inform of the successful MCPTT emergency call establishment.\nNOTE 8:\tStep 10 can occur at any time following step 8, but at the latest following step 9, depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.\n11.\tThe LMR users via the IWF and the affiliated MCPTT clients have successfully established media plane for communication.

The figure depicts the call flow, starting with the LMR user initiating the call and then transitioning to the interworking group. The interworking group is responsible for routing the call to the appropriate participants, ensuring that all users can participate in the call. The figure also shows the handover process, which is crucial for maintaining connectivity during the call. The handover process involves transferring the call from one network to another, ensuring that the call remains connected even if the user moves between different networks. The figure also shows the use of multicast communication, which allows multiple users to receive the same call simultaneously. This feature is useful for group calls, as it allows all participants to hear the same information at the same time. Overall, the figure provides a detailed overview of the setup and handover process for an emergency group call in a LMR system.\nFigure 10.6.2.2.3-1: Emergency group call setup, initiated by LMR user on an interworking group defined in the LMR system\n1.\tThe IWF sends an IWF emergency group call request(s) to the MCPTT server.

Subclause 10.5 is applicable to losing audio during emergency calls as well as non-emergency calls.\nIn MCPTT, the user's profile determines whether an emergency is raised on the user's currently selected group or on a configured default emergency group. It's up to the IWF and the LMR system to which it is connected to determine what group the emergency is raised on and whether an alert is also sent when the emergency is raised. From the perspective of the MCPTT system, all emergency behavior by the IWF on behalf of its users mapped to MCPTT shall comply with behaviors defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7]. The implementation shall ensure that emergency related parameters of a group or private call are adhered to. For example, an MC service group must be configured in the MC sevice group managment system for emergency alerts in order for an emergency alert to be sent on it. This can be enforced through proper configuration of both LMR and MCPTT systems or can be enforced at run time by the IWF.\nAn emergency private call to an LMR user will have emergency priority for the portion of the call transported in the MCPTT system and the LTE EPS but will not receive priority on the LMR system in LMR systems that do not support emergency treatment for private calls.\nThe MCPTT system tracks the emergency state of every group. In interworked LMR systems that do not track the emergency state of groups, only a UE in emergency state will be given emergency priority on the LMR system when talking. For any user talking on an emergency group, the portion of the call transported by the MCPTT system will receive emergency priority.\n",

The figure highlights the importance of error detection and correction mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the transmitted information.\nFigure 10.7.3.1-1: Codec reconciliation procedure\n1.\tThe IWF sends a codec reconciliation request to the MCPTT server on behalf of the LMR system.\n2.\tThe MCPTT server checks that the requested codec is permitted for the MCPTT group.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server sends a codec reconciliation request to all of the affilliated MCPTT client(s) to negotiate the use of the speech codec requested by the LMR system.\n4.\tThe MCPTT client replies with a codec reconciliation response to the MCPTT server, indicating acceptance of the new speech codec.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server sends a codec reconciliation response to the IWF.\n6.\tFurther transmissions in the MCPTT group use the new codec in the media plane.\nNOTE 2:\tThe time at which the new codec is first used by a transmitting party is outside the scope of the present document.\n",

The figure illustrates the active functional alias list query, which is used to retrieve a list of active functional aliases associated with a specific user or device. This information is crucial for network administrators to identify potential security threats and take appropriate action to protect the network. The query interface is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, allowing administrators to quickly access the necessary information to maintain the security of the network.\nFigure 10.14.3.2-1: IWF active functional alias list query\n1.\tThe user homed in the IWF requests a list of active functional aliases for a certain MC service ID from the MC service server by sending an IWF functional alias information query request encompassing the MC service ID or the functional alias of the queried user.\n2.\tThe MC service server checks whether the querying user homed in the IWF is authorized to perform the query. If authorized, then the MC service server retrieves the requested functional alias information based on the corresponding MC service ID or the MC service IDs based on the functional alias.\nEditor's note:\tHow the MC service server checks the authorization of the IWF to perform functional alias related actions is FFS.\n3.\tThe MC service server sends an IWF functional alias information query response including the active functional alias or MC service ID information to the user homed in the IWF.\nThe procedure for the user homed in the IWF activates functional alias(es) within an MC system is illustrated in figure 10.14.3.3-1.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe IWF has already been provisioned (statically or dynamically) with the functional alias(es) information that the user homed in the IWF is allowed to activate.\n2.\tMC service server has retrieved the user subscription and functional alias policy e.g. which user(s) are authorized to activate to what functional alias, priority, and other configuration data.\nFigure 10.14.3.3 -1 illustrates the process of activating functional aliases within an MC system, specifically focusing on the IWF (Identity and Policy Management). The figure outlines the steps involved in the activation procedure, including the role of the IWF, the MC system, and the various components such as the AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) server, RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) server, and the IWF itself. The figure emphasizes the importance of security and policy management in the activation process, ensuring that only authorized entities can perform the activation and that the system remains secure and compliant with regulatory requirements.\nFigure 10.14.3.3-1: IWF functional alias activation procedure within an MC system\n1.\tThe user homed in the IWF requests the MC service server to activate a functional alias or a set of functional aliases.\n2.\tThe MC service server checks if there are any conflicts with active functional alias(es).\n3.\tIf the user homed in the IWF is authorised to activate the requested functional alias(es) then the MC service server stores the functional alias(es) status of the requested functional alias(es).\nEditor's note:\tHow the MC service server checks the authorization of the IWF to perform functional alias related actions is FFS.\nIf a certain functional alias(es) can be simultaneously active for multiple users and the upper limit of number of simultaneous MC service users is not reached, the MC service shall activate the functional alias(es) for the user homed in the IWF and inform all other user(s) with sharing the same functional alias(es) (step 5). If the limit of number of simultaneous users is reached or the functional alias is not allowed to be shared, the request is rejected, and the IWF is notified (step 4).\nEditor's note:\tHow the MC service server checks whether a user homed in the IWF is an \"authorized\" user is FFS.\nIf the functional alias(es) is (are) already used by another user(s), an authorized user homed in the IWF gets an offer to take over the functional alias from the user currently using the functional alias(es).\n4.\tMC service server sends an IWF functional alias(es) activation response to the user homed in the IWF.\n5.\tThe MC service server informs all other MC service user(s) and/or IWF sharing the same functional alias(es).\nThe procedure for the user homed in the IWF de-activates functional alias(es) within an MC system is illustrated in figure 10.14.3.4-1.\nWhen a user homed in the IWF does not want to use a functional alias(es) anymore, then the user homed in the IWF can de-activate functional alias(es).\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tMC service server has already subscribed to the functional alias(es) information from the functional alias management server and has stored the data of the functional alias(es) a user homed in the IWF has activated.\nFigure 10.14.3.4 -1 illustrates the step-by-step process of deactivating a functional alias within an MC system. The figure outlines the IWF (Identity and Policy Manager) configuration, detailing the necessary steps to deactivate a specific functional alias. The process involves identifying the alias, modifying the IWF configuration, and verifying the deactivation. Key components include the IWF, functional alias, and various interfaces involved in the process. The figure emphasizes the importance of accurate configuration and the potential impact of incorrect deactivation on the network's functionality.\nFigure 10.14.3.4-1: IWF functional alias de-activation procedure within an MC system\n1.\tThe user homed in the IWF requests the MC service server to de-activate a functional alias or a set of functional aliases.\n2.\tBased on the MC service user subscription and stored functional alias policy, the MC service server checks if the user homed in the IWF is authorized to de-activate from the requested functional alias(es) and if the user homed in the IWF has activated to the requested functional alias(es).\nEditor's note:\tHow the MC service server checks the authorization of the IWF to perform functional alias related actions is FFS.\n3.\tIf the user homed in the IWF is authorized to de-activate from the requested functional alias(es) then the MC service server updates the functional alias activation status of the user homed in the IWF.\n4.\tMC service server provides to the user homed in the IWF the functional alias de-activation response.\n5.\tThe MC service server informs all other MC service user(s) and/or users homed in the IWF sharing the same functional alias(es).\nThe procedure for the user homed to IWF takes over functional alias(es) within an MC system is illustrated in figure 10.14.3.5-1.\nDuring functional alias(es) activation, if the functional alias(es) is (are) already used by another MC service user(s), an authorized user homed in the IWF can get an offer to take over the functional alias(es) from the MC service user currently using the functional alias(es).\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tMC service client 1 has performed the functional alias(es) activation procedure.\n2.\tAs result of the functional alias(es) activation procedure, the user homed in the IWF is aware which functional alias(es) are already used but can be taken over.\n3.\tThe user homed in the IWF decides to take over a functional alias.\nFigure 10.14.3.5 -1 illustrates the process of an IWF (Intrusion Prevention System) functional alias taking over within an MC (Managed Computer) system. The figure depicts the IWF as the central authority, monitoring and controlling the MC system's activities. The MC system is shown as a series of interconnected components, with the IWF positioned as the central control point. The figure highlights the dynamic nature of the process, with the IWF continuously monitoring and intervening as necessary to maintain security within the system. The figure emphasizes the importance of the IWF in ensuring the integrity and safety of the MC system.\nFigure 10.14.3.5-1: IWF functional alias taking over procedure within an MC system\n1.\tThe user homed in the IWF requests the MC service server to take over a functional alias by sending an IWF functional alias take over request.\n2.\tThe MC service server checks if there are any conflicts taking over the functional alias.\n3.\tIf the user homed in the IWF is authorised to take over the requested functional alias then the MC service server sends a functional alias revoke notification to inform MC service client 1 that the functional alias has been revoked and is not any longer active for the user of MC service client 1.\nEditor's note:\tHow the MC service server checks the authorization of the IWF to perform functional alias related actions is FFS.\n4.\tThe MC service server stores the functional alias status of the requested functional alias.\n5.\tMC service server sends an IWF functional alias take over response to the user homed in the IWF.\n6.\tThe MC service server informs all other MC service user(s) sharing the same functional alias, of the take over by sending a functional alias status notification.\n7.\tThe MC service server informs all user(s) homed in the IWF sharing the same functional alias of the take over by sending an IWF functional alias status notification.\n",

The figure shows the call being initiated by the MCPTT user, who is represented by the red dot, and the call being answered by the intended recipient, represented by the green dot. The figure also shows the communication path taken by the call, with the MCPTT user's device sending a request for a call to the intended recipient's device, which then responds with an acknowledgment. The figure highlights the importance of quick and efficient communication in public safety situations, as the first-to-answer call feature ensures that the MCPTT user's call is answered by the intended recipient as quickly as possible.\nFigure 10.15.3.1-1: MCPTT first-to-answer call initiated by MCPTT user\n1.\tThe MCPTT user at the MCPTT client initiates an MCPTT first-to-answer call. The MCPTT client sends an MCPTT first-to-answer call request towards the MCPTT server. The MCPTT first-to-answer call request contains the MCPTT ID corresponding to the calling MCPTT party and called LMR party, and an SDP offer containing one or more media types. The called LMR party can consist of a set of potential target recipients represented by their MCPTT IDs, or a functional alias. The following parameters are also included that describe the MCPTT client's choices:\n-\tthe encryption algorithm;\n-\tthe encryption mode (encrypted or not);\n-\tan indication of whether the MCPTT client is requesting the floor, and if the MCPTT client is requesting the floor, and\n-\tan indication of whether the call is to be full or half duplex (whether to establish floor control).\n2.\tThe MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user at the MCPTT client is authorized to initiate the first-to-answer call. The MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias of the calling user, if present, can be used and has been activated for the MCPTT user.\n3.\tIf authorized, the MCPTT server sends the IWF first-to-answer call request that may or may not include location of the requestor, depending on the outcome of the privacy check towards the IWF, including the original parameters and offering the same media types or a subset of the media types contained in the initial received request as per 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].\nNOTE:\tHow the IWF first-to-answer call request is forwarded to the LMR system is out of scope of the present document.\n4.\tThe IWF sends an IWF first-to-answer call response to the MCPTT server, indicating that the IWF does support one of the requested media types. The response indicates success or failure. If the indication is failure, the response may include one or more alternatives to the parameter values contained in step 3.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server forwards the MCPTT first-to-answer call response to the MCPTT client. If the result parameter indicates success, then the MCPTT client proceeds to step 6. Otherwise, if the parameters returned in the MCPTT first-to-answer call response are acceptable to the MCPTT client, then the MCPTT client can send a new MCPTT first-to-answer call request with the new parameters and behaves according to those parameters. The calling MCPTT user may be notified of the change in parameters, for example, that the call is to be without floor control. The MCPTT user can choose to end the call rather than continue with the new parameters. If the parameters returned are not acceptable to the MCPTT client, then the call fails.\n6.\tThe MCPTT client has successfully established media plane for communication to the IWF and either end can transmit media. The MCPTT system initiating the call is responsible of granting the floor, solving competing floor requests and issuing floor revoked indications.\nIn this procedure, an MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT first-to-answer call for communicating with an LMR user via an IWF.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe calling LMR user has selected first-to-answer call\n2.\tThe MCPTT client is registered to the MCPTT service, as per procedure in subclause 10.2 in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].\n3.\tThe MCPTT server has subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\n\nFigure 10.15.3.2-1 depicts the process of an MCPTT (Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk) user initiating a first-to-answer call. The figure illustrates the sequence of events that occur when a user dials a specific number and the call is answered by the intended recipient. The MCPTT system ensures that the call is routed to the correct person, even in the event of network congestion or interference. The figure highlights the importance of quick and efficient communication in critical situations, where every second counts.\nFigure 10.15.3.2-1: MCPTT first-to-answer call initiated by MCPTT user\n1.\tThe IWF sends an IWF first-to-answer call request towards the MCPTT server.
