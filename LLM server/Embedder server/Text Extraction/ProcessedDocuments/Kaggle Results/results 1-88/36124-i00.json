            "description": "The present document establishes the essential EMC requirements for \"3rd generation\" digital cellular mobile terminal equipment and ancillary accessories in combination with a 3GPP E-UTRA user equipment (UE).\nThe equipment conforming to the requirements laid out in the present document and used in its intended electromagnetic environment in accordance with the manufacturers instructions\n-\tshall not generate electromagnetic disturbances at a level which may interfere with the intended operation of other equipment;\n-\thas an adequate level of intrinsic immunity to electromagnetic disturbances to operate as intended;\nThe present document specifies the applicable EMC tests, the methods of measurement, the frequency range, the limits and the minimum performance criteria for all types of E-UTRA UE´s and their accessories. E-UTRA base station equipment operating within network infrastructure is outside the scope of the present document. However, the present document does cover mobile and portable equipment that is intended to be operated in a fixed location while connected to the AC mains. E-UTRA base stations in the radio access network are covered by the technical specification TS36.113 [2].\nRequirements for the radiated emission from the enclosure port of integral antenna equipment and ancillaries have been included. Technical specifications for conducted emissions from the antenna connector are found in the 3GPP specifications for the radio interface, e.g. TS36.521 [3], for the effective use of the radio spectrum.\nThe immunity requirements have been selected to ensure an adequate level of compatibility for apparatus in residential, commercial, light industrial and vehicular environments. The levels however, do not cover extreme cases, which may occur in any location but with low probability of occurrence.\nThe environment classification used in the present document refers to the environment classification used in the Generic Standards IEC 61000-6-1 [4], IEC 61000-6-3 [5], except the vehicular environment class which refers to ISO 7637 Part 1 [6] and Part 2 [7].\nCompliance of radio equipment to the requirements of the present document does not signify compliance to any requirement related to the use of the equipment (i.e. licensing requirements).\nCompliance to the requirements of the present document does not signify compliance to any safety requirement. However, any temporary or permanent unsafe condition caused by EMC is considered as non-compliance.\n",

                    "text_content": "For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions apply.\nAncillary equipment: Equipment (apparatus), used in connection with a user equipment (UE) is considered as an ancillary equipment (apparatus) if:\n-\tthe equipment is intended for use in conjunction with a UE to provide additional operational and/or control features to the UE, (e.g. to extend control to another position or location); and\n-\tthe equipment cannot be used on a stand alone basis to provide user functions independently of a UE; and\n-\tthe UE to which it is connected, is capable of providing some intended operation such as transmitting and/or receiving without the ancillary equipment (i.e. it is not a sub-unit of the main equipment essential to the main equipment basic functions).\nAverage power: The average transmitter output power obtained over any specified time interval, including periods with no transmission, when the transmit time slots are at the maximum power setting.\nCamped on a cell: The UE is in idle mode and has completed the cell selection/reselection process and has chosen a cell. The UE monitors system information and (in most cases) paging information. Note that the services may be limited, and that the PLMN may not be aware of the existence of the UE within the chosen cell.\nChannel bandwidth: The RF bandwidth supporting a single E-UTRA RF carrier with the transmission bandwidth configured in the uplink or downlink of a cell. The channel bandwidth is measured in MHz and is used as a reference for transmitter and receiver RF requirements.\nContinuous phenomena (continuous disturbance): Electromagnetic disturbance, the effects of which on a particular device or equipment cannot be resolved into a succession of distinct effects (IEC 60050-161 [8]).\nData application ancillary: Ancillary which provides send and/or receive data access to UMTS services via UE.\nEnclosure port: Physical boundary of the apparatus through which electromagnetic fields may radiate or impinge. In the case of integral antenna equipment, this port is inseparable from the antenna port.\nEnd- User data: Manufacturer defined data patterns for data transfer testing. Represents EUT´s typical user application (e.g. photo, video, text file, message) in its characteristics.\nIdle mode: Idle mode is the state of User Equipment (UE) when switched on but with no Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection.\nIntegral antenna: Antenna designed to be connected directly to the equipment with or without the use of an external connector and considered to be part of the equipment. An integral antenna may be fitted internally or externally to the equipment.\nMaximum throughput: The maximum achievable throughput for a reference measurement channel.\nNecessary bandwidth: For a given class of emission, the width of the frequency band which is just sufficient to ensure the transmission of information at the rate and with the quality required under specified conditions.\nOut of band emissions: Emission on a frequency or frequencies immediately outside the necessary bandwidth, which results from, the modulation process, but excluding spurious emissions.\nNOTE:\tAny unwanted emission which falls at frequencies separated from the centre frequency of the emission by less than 250% of the necessary bandwidth of the emission will generally be considered out-of-band emission.\nPort: particular interface, of the specified equipment (apparatus), with the electromagnetic environment. For example, any connection point on an equipment intended for connection of cables to or from that equipment is considered as a port (see figure 1).\n\nSpurious emission from ITU-R SM 329 [9]: Emission on a frequency, or frequencies, which are outside the necessary bandwidth and the level of which may be reduced without affecting the corresponding transmission of information. Spurious emissions include harmonic emissions, parasitic emissions, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products but exclude out-of-band emissions.\nTelecommunication port: Ports which are intended to be connected to telecommunication networks (e.g. public switched telecommunication networks, integrated services digital networks), local area networks (e.g. Ethernet, Token Ring) and similar networks (see CISPR 22 [10]).\nThroughput: The number of payload bits successfully received per second for a reference measurement channel in a specified reference condition.\nTransient phenomena: Pertaining to or designating a phenomena or a quantity which varies between two consecutive steady states during a time interval short compared with the time-scale of interest (IEC 60050-161 [8])\nTraffic mode: Is the state of User Equipment (UE) when switched on and with Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection established.\nUniversal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS): The telecommunications system, incorporating mobile cellular and other functionality, that is the subject of specifications produced by 3GPP\nUser equipment (UE): is a \"Mobile Station\" (MS) which is an entity capable of accessing a set of UMTS services via one or more radio interfaces. This entity may be stationary or in motion within the UMTS service area while accessing the UMTS services, and may simultaneously serve one or more users.\n",

If no such level is specified, the centre volume step shall be used.\nPrior to the test sequence, the reference level of the speech output signal on both the downlink and uplink shall be recorded on the test instrumentation, as shown in figure A.1. The reference level shall be equivalent to the SPL of 0 dBPa at 1 kHz at the input of the acoustical coupler described in ETR 027 [25], for the downlink, and -5dBPs at 1 kHz at the mouth reference point (MRP) defined in ITU_T recommendation P.64 [26] for the uplink.\nNOTE 1:\tThe MRP is defined with respect to an artificial head defined in ITU-T P 76 [27. The handset shall be mounted on the artificial head such that the ear piece is centred at the artificial ear.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the equipment does not include acoustical transducers (e.g. a microphone or loudspeaker) the manufacturer shall specify the equivalent electrical reference levels.\nThe voice processor may often apply noise and echo cancellation algorithms, which attempt to eliminate or reduce steady state audio signals as e.g., the 1 kHz calibration signals. These algorithms may be disabled during the calibration procedure. Specialised test software may be required. If the algorithms can not be disabled then the reference level shall be measured using a max-hold detection on the audio level meter in order to determine the level before the noise and echo cancellation algorithms become effective.\nIn handsfree applications an external loudspeaker is used. The SPL from the external loudspeaker is normally much higher than from the earpiece of the portable in order overcome a high ambient noise level. The downlink reference level shall be increased in order to compensate for the difference. Alternatively, the distance between the loudspeaker and the measuring microphone shall be adjusted during the measurement procedure in accordance with the manufacturers specification. It is important that the dynamic range of the test instrumentation is not exceeded.\nNormally no corrections are made to the uplink reference level. In case it is not possible to perform the above calibration (e.g., a PC card with headset) the manufacturer shall specify the distance between the MRP and the microphone.\nFigure A.1 -1 illustrates the calibration set-up for portable audio equipment, focusing on the measurement and breakthrough of sound waves. The image showcases a comprehensive arrangement of equipment, including a microphone, sound source, and various sensors, designed to assess the performance of portable audio devices. The calibration process is essential for ensuring accurate sound reproduction and quality control in real-world applications.\nFigure A.1-1: Audio breakthrough measurement, calibration set-up for portable equipment\nNOTE:\tThe EUT is in position during calibration of the uplink, but not during calibration of the downlink where the EUT is replaced by the 1 kHz test audio source. During calibration of the uplink the mouthpiece shall be placed with respect to the MRP in a way representing intended use.\n",

When an external loudspeaker is used the acoustical coupler shall be fixed to the loudspeaker in the position used during the calibration.
