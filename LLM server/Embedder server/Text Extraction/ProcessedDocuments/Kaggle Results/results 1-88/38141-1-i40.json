If any external apparatus such as a RX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such devices is used, requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (test port B).\nFigure 4.5.1.2.1-1 illustrates the receiver test ports, which are essential components in a telecommunication system. The ports are strategically placed to facilitate the efficient transmission and reception of signals. The ports are designed to handle a wide range of signal frequencies, ensuring compatibility with various communication standards. The ports are also equipped with advanced filtering and amplification capabilities to optimize signal quality. The layout of the ports is optimized for ease of access and maintenance, with clear demarcation between different types of ports to prevent confusion. Overall, the receiver test ports play a crucial role in the performance of the telecommunication system, and their design and placement are critical to achieving optimal results.\nFigure 4.5.1.2.1-1: Receiver test ports\nFor the tests in clause 7 of the present document, the requirement applies at each receiver antenna connector for receivers with antenna diversity or in the case of multi-carrier reception with multiple receiver antenna connectors.\nReceiver requirements are tested at the antenna connector, with the remaining receiver(s) disabled or their antenna connector(s) being terminated. If the manufacturer has declared the receiver paths to be equivalent (D.32), it is sufficient to apply the specified test signal at any one of the receiver antenna connectors.\nFor a BS type 1-C supporting multi-band operation, multi-band tests for ACS, blocking and intermodulation are performed with the interferer(s) applied to each antenna connector mapped to the receiver for the wanted signal(s), however only to one antenna connector at a time. Antenna connectors to which no signals are applied are terminated.\nThe requirements of the present document shall be met with a duplexer fitted, if a duplexer is supplied as part of the BS. If the duplexer is supplied as an option by the manufacturer, sufficient tests should be repeated with and without the duplexer fitted to verify that the BS meets the requirements of the present document in both cases.\nThe following tests shall be performed with the duplexer fitted, and without it fitted if this is an option:\n1)\tclause 6.2, base station output power, for the highest static power step only, if this is measured at the antenna connector;\n2)\tclause 6.6, unwanted emissions; outside the BS transmit band;\n3)\tclause 6.6.5.5.1.2, protection of the BS receiver;\n4)\tclause 6.7, transmit intermodulation; for the testing of conformance, the carrier frequencies should be selected to minimize intermodulation products from the transmitters falling in receive channels.\nThe remaining tests may be performed with or without the duplexer fitted.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen performing receiver tests with a duplexer fitted, it is important to ensure that the output from the transmitters does not affect the test apparatus. This can be achieved using a combination of attenuators, isolators and filters.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen duplexers are used, intermodulation products will be generated, not only in the duplexer but also in the antenna system. The intermodulation products generated in the antenna system are not controlled by 3GPP specifications, and may degrade during operation (e.g. due to moisture ingress). Therefore, to ensure continued satisfactory operation of a BS, an operator will normally select NR-ARFCNs to minimize intermodulation products falling on receive channels. For testing of complete conformance, an operator may specify the NR-ARFCNs to be used.\nIf the BS is supplied with a number of different power supply configurations, it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each of the power supply options, provided that it can be demonstrated that the range of conditions over which the equipment is tested is at least as great as the range of conditions due to any of the power supply configurations.\nThis applies particularly if a BS contains a DC rail which can be supplied either externally or from an internal mains power supply. In this case, the conditions of extreme power supply for the mains power supply options can be tested by testing only the external DC supply option. The range of DC input voltages for the test should be sufficient to verify the performance with any of the power supplies, over its range of operating conditions within the BS, including variation of mains input voltage, temperature and output current.\nThe BS type 1-C requirements of the present document shall be met with the ancillary RF amplifier fitted. At tests according to clauses 6 and 7 for TX and RX respectively, the ancillary amplifier is connected to the BS by a connecting network (including any cable(s), attenuator(s), etc.) with applicable loss to make sure the appropriate operating conditions of the ancillary amplifier and the BS. The applicable connecting network loss range is declared by the manufacturer (D.35). Other characteristics and the temperature dependence of the attenuation of the connecting network are neglected. The actual attenuation value of the connecting network is chosen for each test as one of the applicable extreme values. The lowest value is used unless otherwise stated.\nSufficient tests should be repeated with the ancillary amplifier fitted and, if it is optional, without the ancillary RF amplifier to verify that the BS meets the requirements of the present document in both cases.\nWhen testing, the following tests shall be repeated with the optional ancillary amplifier fitted according to the table below, where \"x\" denotes that the test is applicable:\nTable 4.5.1.5-1: Tests applicable to ancillary RF amplifiers\n\nNOTE 1:\tCombining can be by duplex filters or any other network. The amplifiers can either be in RX or TX branch or in both. Either one of these amplifiers could be a passive network.\nNOTE 2:\tUnless otherwise stated, BS with both TX and RX amplifiers are tested once with both amplifiers active for each test.\nIn base station output power test (clause 6.2) and reference sensitivity level test (clause 7.2) highest applicable attenuation value is applied.\n",

It is measured at the transmit antenna connector for BS type 1-C or at the TAB connector for BS type 1-H for any type of BS which has common or separate Tx/Rx antenna connectors / TAB connectors.\nThe basic limits are provided in table 6.6.5.5.1.2-1.\nTable 6.6.5.5.1.2-1: BS spurious emissions basic limits for protection of the BS receiver\n\nThese requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating in frequency ranges other than the BS downlink operating band. The limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the same geographical area as the BS, or they may be set by local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an NR operating band. It is in some cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the present document is given in clause 4.4.\nSome requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment (UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the basic limits of table 6.6.5.5.1.3-1 for a BS where requirements for co-existence with the system listed in the first column apply. For a multi-band connector, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table 6.6.5.5.1.3-1 apply for each supported operating band.\nTable 6.6.5.5.1.3-1: BS spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with systems operating in other frequency bands\n\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS operating in Band n28, the co-existence requirements in table 6.6.5.5.1.3-1do not apply for the ΔfOBUE frequency range immediately outside the downlink operating band (see TS 38.104 [2], table 5.2-1). Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional requirements.\nNOTE 2:\tTable 6.6.5.5.1.3-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the frequency ranges in TS 38.104 [2], table 5.2-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tTDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that are synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can transmit without additional co-existence requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 4:\tFor Band n28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with E-UTRA Band 27 UL operating band.\nNOTE 5:\tFor NR Band n29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the spurious emissions limits for NR BS for co-existence with UTRA Band XII, E-UTRA Band 12 or NR Band n12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 85 UL or NR Band n85 UL operating band.\nThe following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between ΔfOBUE below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band and ΔfOBUE above the highest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band. ΔfOBUE is defined in clause 6.6.1.\nThe basic limits for this requirement is:\nTable 6.6.5.5.1.3-2: BS spurious emissions basic limits for BS for co-existence with PHS\n\nTable 6.6.5.5.1.3-3: Void\nIn certain regions, the following requirement may apply to BS operating in Band n50 and n75 within 1432-1452 MHz, and in Band n51 and Band n76. The basic limits are specified in table 6.6.5.5.1.3-4. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from ΔfOBUE below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to ΔfOBUE above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nTable 6.6.5.5.1.3-4: Additional operating band unwanted emission basic limits for BS operating in Band n50 and n75 within 1432-1452 MHz, and in Band 51 and 76\n\nIn certain regions, the following requirement may apply to BS operating in NR Band n50 within 1492-1517 MHz. The maximum level of emissions, measured on centre frequencies Ffilter with filter bandwidth according to table 6.6.5.5.1.3-5, shall be defined according to the basic limits PEM,n50,a and PEM,B50,b declared by the manufacturer.\nTable 6.6.5.5.1.3-5: Operating band n50, n74 and n75 declared emission above 1518 MHz\n\nNOTE:\tThe regional requirement, included in ECC/DEC/(17)06 [14], is defined in terms of EIRP, which is dependent on both the BS emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement. The assessment of the EIRP level is described in TS 38.104 [2] annex E.\nIn certain regions, the following requirement shall be applied to BS operating in Band n13 and n14 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 700 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.5.5.1.3-6: BS Spurious emissions limits for protection of 700 MHz public safety operations\n\nThe following requirement may apply to NR BS operating in Band n30 in certain regions. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.5.5.1.3-7: Additional NR BS Spurious emissions limits for Band n30\n\nThe following requirement may apply to BS operating in Band n48 in certain regions. The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.5.2.3-8: Additional BS Spurious emissions limits for Band n48\n\nNOTE:\tThe resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.\nThe following requirement shall be applied to BS operating in Band n26 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 800 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.5.2.3-9: BS Spurious emissions limits for protection of 800 MHz public safety operations\n\nThe following requirement may apply to BS for Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from ΔfOBUE below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to ΔfOBUE above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nThe power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.5.5.1.3-10: Additional BS Spurious emissions limits for Band n41 and n90\n\nThe following requirement may apply to BS operating in 3.45-3.55 GHz in Band n77 in certain regions. Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in table 6.6.5.5.1.3-11.\nTable 6.6.5.5.1.3-11: Additional BS spurious emissions limits for Band n77\n\nNOTE:\tThe resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.\nThe following requirement shall apply to BS operating in Band n101 in CEPT countries. The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.5.5.1.3-12: Additional BS Spurious emissions limits for Band n101\n\nThe following requirement shall apply to BS operating in Band n100 in CEPT countries. The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 6.6.5.5.1.3-13: Additional BS Spurious emissions limits for Band n100\n\nThe following requirement may also apply to BS operating in Band n54 in certain regions. The level of emissions in the 1541 – 1650 MHz band, measured in measurement bandwidth according to Table 6.6.5.5.1.3-14 shall not exceed the maximum emission levels PEM,n54,a, PEM,n54,b, PEM,n54,c, PEM,n54,d, PEM,n54,e and PEM,n54,f declared by the manufacturer.\n\nTable 6.6.5.5.1.3-14: Declared Band n54 emissions levels for protection of the 1541-1650 MHz band\n\nNote:\tThe regional requirements is defined in terms of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The EIRP level is calculated using: PEIRP = PE + Gant where PE denotes the BS unwanted emission level at the antenna connector, Gant equals the BS antenna gain minus feeder loss. The requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement specified in attachment to the FCC reference document, 0007135419.\n\nThese requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.\nThe requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver and are based on co-location with base stations of the same class.\nThe basic limits are in table 6.6.5.5.1.4-1 for a BS where requirements for co-location with a BS type listed in the first column apply, depending on the declared BS class (D.2). For a multi-band connector, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table 6.6.5.5.1.4-1 shall apply for each supported operating band.\nTable 6.6.5.5.1.4-1: BS spurious emissions basic limits for BS co-located with another BS\n\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-location requirements in table 6.6.5.5.1.4-1 do not apply for the frequency range extending ΔfOBUE immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a downlink operating band (see TS 38.104 [2] table 5.2-1). The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [15].\nNOTE 2:\tTable 6.6.5.5.1.4-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in TS 38.104 [2] table 5.2-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tCo-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the same or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nThe Tx spurious emissions for BS type 1-C for each antenna connector shall not exceed the basic limits specified in clause 6.6.5.5.1.\nFor Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of the spurious emissions over all antenna connectors for BS type 1-C shall not exceed the basic limits defined in clause 6.6.5.5.1.\nThe Tx spurious emissions requirements for BS type 1-H are that for each TAB connector TX min cell group and each applicable basic limit in clause 6.6.5.5.1, the power summation emissions at the TAB connectors of the TAB connector TX min cell group shall not exceed a limit specified as the basic limit + X, where X = 10log10(NTXU,countedpercell), unless stated differently in regional regulation.\nNOTE:\tConformance to the BS type 1-H spurious emission requirement can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as determined by the manufacturer:\n1) The sum of the emissions power measured on each TAB connector in the TAB connector TX min cell group shall be less than or equal to the limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span.\nOr\n2) The unwanted emissions power at each TAB connector shall be less than or equal to the BS type 1-H limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span, scaled by -10log10(n), where n is the number of TAB connectors in the TAB connector TX min cell group.\n",

The requirements are not applied for a local area BS that supports 2-step RA type.\nWhich specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.1.\nThe minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 [2] clause 8.2.9.\nThe test shall verify the receiver's ability to achieve maximum BLER for a given SNR.\nTest environment:\tNormal, see annex B.2.\nRF channels to be tested:\tM; see clause 4.9.1.\nRF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: MBW Channel CA; see clause 4.9.1.\n1)\tConnect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, channel simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.5 and D.6 for BS type 1-C and type 1-H respectively.\n2)\tAdjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth, defined in table 8.2.9.4.2-1.\nTable 8.2.9.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the BS input\n\n3)\tThe characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in annex A and the test parameters in table 8.2.9.4.2-2.\nTable 8.2.9.4.2-2: Test parameters for testing msgA PUSCH for 2-step RA type\n\n4)\tThe channel simulators shall be configured according to the corresponding channel model defined in annex G.3.\n5)\tAdjust the equipment so that required SNR specified in table 8.2.9.5-1 to 8.2.9.5-4 is achieved at the BS input.\n6)\tThe test signal genentor send a MsgA including a preamble and PUSCH signal and the receiver tries to detect the MsgA signal. The MsgA signal is sent with a timing offset as described below.\nThe timing offset base value for MsgA signal is set to 0. For each newly transmitted MsgA, this offset is increased within the loop. For 15 kHz SCS, add a value of 0.2 us in each step until the end of the tested rage which is 3.8 us. For 30 kHz SCS, add a value of 0.1 us in each step until the end of tested rage which is 2 us. At the end of the testing range, the offset is reset to zero. The timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission is presented in Figure 8.2.9.4.2-1 for 30 kHz SCS and in Figure 8.2.9.4.2-2 for 15 kHz SCS.\n\n\nFigure 8.2.9.4.2-1 illustrates a timing offset scheme for message A transmission between base stations of types 1-C and 1-H, with a 30 kHz subcarrier spacing (SCS). The figure depicts the synchronization and timing offset adjustments required for successful message transmission between these two types of base stations. The diagram showcases the relationship between the base stations, the timing offset values, and the overall synchronization process, highlighting the importance of precise timing in wireless communication systems.\nFigure 8.2.9.4.2-1: Timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission for BS type 1-C and type 1-H with 30 kHz SCS\nFigure 8.2.9.4.2-2 illustrates a timing offset scheme for Message A transmission between BS type 1-C and type 1-H, utilizing a 15 kHz SCS (Signal Channel Separation). The figure depicts two base stations (BS) with different characteristics, with one being type 1-C and the other type 1-H. The timing offset is crucial for maintaining synchronization and accurate signal transmission between the two base stations. The figure shows the offset in microseconds, which is a measure of the difference in timing between the two base stations. This offset is essential for ensuring that the two base stations can communicate effectively and avoid interference, which is critical for maintaining reliable communication in a network.\nFigure 8.2.9.4.2-2: Timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission for BS type 1-C and type 1-H with 15 kHz SCS\n7)\tFor each of the reference channels in table 8.2.9.5-1 to 8.2.9.5-4 applicable for the base station, measure the BLER.\nThe BLER measured according to clause 8.2.9.4.2 shall not be below the limits for the SNR levels specified in Table 8.2.9.5-1 to 8.2.9.5-4.

                            "text_content": "The performance requirement of PRACH for preamble detection is determined by the two parameters: total probability of false detection of the preamble (Pfa) and the probability of detection of preamble (Pd). The performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of detection, Pd of 99%. Pfa shall be 0.1% or less.\nPfa is defined as a conditional total probability of erroneous detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when input is only noise.\nPd is defined as conditional probability of detection of the preamble when the signal is present. The erroneous detection consists of several error cases – detecting only different preamble(s) than the one that was sent, not detecting any preamble at all, or detecting the correct preamble but with the out-of-bounds timing estimation value.\nFor AWGN and TDLC300-100, and TDLA30-10, a timing estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than the time error tolerance values given in table 8.4.1.1-1.\nTable 8.4.1.1-1: Time error tolerance for AWGN and TDLC300-100\n\nThe test preambles for normal mode are listed in table A.6-1. The test preambles for high speed train restricted set type A are listed in table A.6-3 and the test preambles for high speed train restricted set type B are listed in table A.6-4. The test preambles for high speed train short formats are listed in table A.6-5. The test preambles for PRACH with LRA=1151 and LRA=571 are listed in table A.6-6.\nWhich specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2. The performance requirements for high speed train (table 8.4.1. 6-1 to 8.4.1.6-4) are optional.\nThe minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 [2] clause 8.4.1.2 and 8.4.2.2, 8.4.2.3, and 8.4.2.4.\nThe test shall verify the receiver's ability to detect PRACH preamble under static conditions and multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.\nTest environment: Normal; see annex B.2.\nRF channels to be tested: for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.\n1)\tConnect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.5 and D.6 for BS type 1-C and BS type 1-H respectively.\n2)\tAdjust the AWGN generator, according to the SCS and channel bandwidth.\n\nTable 8.4.1.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the BS input\n\n3)\tThe characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in annex A and the test parameter msg1-FrequencyStart is set to 0.\n4)\tThe multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the corresponding channel model defined in annex G.\n5)\tAdjust the frequency offset of the test signal according to table 8.4.1.5-1 or 8.4.1.5-2 or 8.4.1.5-3 or 8.4.1.6-1 or 8.4.1.6-2 or 8.4.1.6-3 or 8.4.1.6-4 or 8.4.1.7-1 or 8.4.1.7-2.\n6)\tAdjust the equipment so that the SNR specified in table 8.4.1.5-1 or 8.4.1.5-2 or 8.4.1.5-3 or 8.4.1.6-1 or 8.4.1.6-2 or 8.4.1.6-3 or 8.4.1.6-4 or 8.4.1.7-1 or 8.4.1.7-2 is achieved at the BS input during the PRACH preambles.\n7)\tThe test signal generator sends a preamble and the receiver tries to detect the preamble. This pattern is repeated as illustrated in figure 8.4.1.4.2-1. The preambles are sent with certain timing offsets as described below. The following statistics are kept: the number of preambles detected in the idle period and the number of missed preambles.\nFigure 8.4.1.4.2-1 illustrates the PRACH preamble test pattern, which is a crucial component in the 5G New Radio (NR) protocol. The figure showcases the structure of the preamble, including the cyclic prefix, and the synchronization sequence. The preamble is designed to provide synchronization and channel estimation for the receiver, ensuring accurate timing and frequency synchronization. The figure highlights the importance of the PRACH preamble in achieving high-quality communication in 5G NR networks.\nFigure 8.4.1.4.2-1: PRACH preamble test pattern\nThe timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format 0 is set to 50% of Ncs. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested range, which is 0.9us. Then the loop is being reset and the timing offset is set again to 50% of Ncs. The timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0 is presented in figure 8.4.1.4.2-2.\nFigure 8.4.1.4.2-2 illustrates a timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0, which is used in the synchronization process of a wireless communication system. The figure shows the relationship between the preamble, its timing offset, and the synchronization signal. The preamble is a series of symbols that are transmitted by the base station and received by the mobile station. The timing offset is the difference between the actual time of the preamble and the reference time, which is used to synchronize the two devices. The synchronization signal is the reference time that is used to align the preamble with the reference clock. The figure shows how the timing offset is calculated and how it is used to synchronize the two devices. The figure is important for understanding the synchronization process in a wireless communication system and for designing systems that are robust to timing errors.\nFigure 8.4.1.4.2-2: Timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0\nThe timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format A1, A2, A3, B4, C0 and C2 is set to 0. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested range, which is 0.8 us. Then the loop is being reset and the timing offset is set again to 0. The timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format A1, A2, A3, B4, C0 and C2 is presented in figure 8.4.1.4.2-3.\nFigure 8.4.1.4.2-3 illustrates a timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format A1, A2, A3, B4, C0, and C2. The figure depicts the synchronization of the preamble sequences, which is crucial for efficient communication in wireless networks. The PRACH preamble is used to establish a reliable channel for data transmission, and the timing offset scheme ensures that the preambles align correctly, minimizing the risk of errors. The figure shows the relationship between the preamble sequences and the timing offsets, providing a clear understanding of how the system synchronizes and operates effectively.\nFigure 8.4.1.4.2-3: Timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format A1 A2, A3, B4, C0 and C2\nPfa shall not exceed 0.1%.

For FDD, there are  FFTs performed where  is the number of slots in a 10 ms measurement interval, and the number of symbols in a slot for normal CP is 14.\nThe position in time for the FFT shall be determined.\nFor the example used in the annex, the FFT window length is 4096 samples per OFDM symbol. 280 FFTs (i.e. 1,146,880 samples) cover less than the acquired number of samples (i.e. 1,228,800 samples in 10 ms).\nIn an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic prefix without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the window. The EVM requirements shall be met within a window W < CP. There are three different instants for FFT:\n-\tCentre of the reduced window, called ,\n-\t, and\n-\t.\nThe value of EVM window length W is obtained from tables 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS and the transmission bandwidth.\nThe BS shall transmit a signal according to the test models intended for EVM. The demodulation reference signal of the second ideal signal shall be used to find the centre of the FFT window.\nThe timing of the measured signal is determined in the pre-FFT domain as follows, using  and :\n1.\tThe measured signal is delay spread by the TX filter. Hence the distinct borders between the OFDM symbols and between data and CP are also spread and the timing is not obvious.\n2.\tIn the ideal signal , the timing is known.\nCorrelation between bullet (1) and (2) will result in a correlation peak. The meaning of the correlation peak is approximately the \"impulse response\" of the TX filter.\n3.\tThe meaning of \"impulse response\" assumes that the autocorrelation of the ideal signal  is a Dirac peak and that the correlation between the ideal signal  and the data in the measured signal is 0. The correlation peak, (the highest, or in case of more than one highest, the earliest) indicates the timing in the measured signal.\nThe number of samples used for FFT is reduced compared to . This subset of  samples is called .\nFrom the acquired samples one timing can be derived.\nThe timing of the centre  is determined according to the cyclic prefix length of the OFDM symbols. For normal CP, there are two values for  in a 1 ms period:\n-\t = length of cylic prefix / 2,\n-\t = Longer CP length - length of cylic prefix / 2,\nWhere the length of cyclic prefix is obtained from table 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS, and the longer CP length is obtained from table H.2.4-1.\nAs per the example values:\n-\t = 144 within the CP of length 288 for OFDM symbols 1 to 13 of a slot,\n-\t = 208= 352 - 144) within the CP of length 352 for OFDM symbol 0 of a slot.\n",

                            "text_content": "A statistical test is characterized by test time, selectivity and confidence level. The outcome of the statistical test is a decision. This decision may be correct, i.e., BSs whose BLER is greater than 0.001% being declared to fail, and BSs whose BLER is smaller or equal to 0.001% being declared to pass, or in-correct (as detailed above). The Confidence Level (CL) describes the probability that the decision is a correct one. The complement is the wrong decision probability (risk) D = 1-CL.\nWhen testing BLER, transport blocks or \"samples\" are observed and the numbers of correctly and erroneously received blocks are recorded. For a \"standard\" test, a pre-defined number of samples are observed, and a pass/fail decision is made based on the number of observed errors being above/below a threshold. This threshold is based on the targeted BLER and the design target CL. There is always some risk of a statistical variation leading to an incorrect pass/fail decision. The greater the number of samples that are recorded, the lower is the risk of such an error. The number of samples that are observed in a standard test is dimensioned to achieve an acceptable low risk of error (i.e., an acceptable high confidence level) for BS that just meet the BLER limit.\nThe standard test works well where the BLER level is relatively high and confidence level relatively low (both are chosen to be on a comparable order of magnitude). However, for ultra-low BLER testing the length of time required for observing sufficient samples to achieve a 99.999% confidence level is excessive. In many cases, the BS will in fact have a much lower true BLER than the limit, i.e., design target of the test, (in which case, the number of samples needed to achieve high confidence that the BLER is lower than the limit is much smaller) or, if failing the requirement will have a much higher true BLER (in which case, errors occur more frequently and it can be demonstrated that the BS is above the BLER limit with fewer samples).\nTo avoid long test times, an alternative test method called early pass/fail is adopted. With the early pass/fail, each time a block error is encountered, a decision is made on whether the BS can be passed/failed with 99.999% CL or the test needs to continue until another error is encountered. In the case of very good BSs, the test can also be passed, when the number of samples permissible for one error event is reached and no error event is recorded.  Pass/Fail is decided based on the total number of observed samples and errors, and a statistical calculation based on an inverse binomial cumulative distribution. The calculation involves one parameter, one variable and the result:\n-\tParameter: d (per step decision probability).\n-\tVariable: ne (number of observed errors).\n-\tResult: ns (number of expected samples for pass/fail, depending on which one is calculated).\nThe per step decision probability risk, d, expresses the probability of making an incorrect pass/fail decision in the current step (i.e., for the current decision coordinate). d is determined by simulation such that the overall risk of making a wrong decision over all steps of each test of a large number of tests on a large number of BSs that exactly meet the BLER limit is D=0.001% (and hence the CL 99.999%).\nIt should be noted that d is determined separately considering early pass and early fail testing.\nFor a marginal BS (i.e., a BS almost exactly meeting the BLER), the unmodified early pass/early fail approach is unable to distinguish whether the BS has just passed or just failed the BLER (ε→0), and can thus terminate with an \"undecided\" result. To avoid this undecided result and provide selectivity, a so-called \"bad device factor\" (M) is introduced into the early pass calculation. This factor biases the decision towards avoiding failing good BS.\n",
