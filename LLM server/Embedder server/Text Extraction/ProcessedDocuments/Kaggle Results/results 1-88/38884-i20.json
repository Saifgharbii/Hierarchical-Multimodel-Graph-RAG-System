In this test configuration, the geometric centre of the DUT is aligned with the centre of the quiet zone as illustrated in Figure 5.1.3-1.\nFigure 5.1.3-1 illustrates the black box approach to network analysis, focusing on the input, processing, and output stages. The figure depicts a network device as a closed box, with the input and output interfaces clearly labeled.

Each layer is represented by a white box, and the connections between them are depicted by lines. The physical layer is responsible for transmitting data over the network, while the data link layer ensures reliable transmission. The network layer is responsible for routing data packets, and the transport layer provides reliable transmission. The application layer is responsible for providing services to end users.

Here, a DUT with three antenna panels is considered shown schematically in Figure 5.1.3-3 on the left. The right side shows coverage sectors and the corresponding antenna panels the DUT would select if the DL was presented from within those sectors. In this example, the red antenna panel would yield the TX beam peak in the horizontal direction; this direction would be identified following the TX beam peak search. For simplicity, most of the arguments in the next few paragraphs are applied to testing in the FF but they can be applied to testing in the NF as well.\nFigure 5.1.3-3 illustrates a Device Under Test (DUT) equipped with three antenna panels, each designed for different frequency bands. The DUT is positioned at the center, with the first antenna panel on the left, the second on the right, and the third at the top. Each antenna is connected to a separate feedline, which leads to a common RF chain. The RF chain is responsible for converting the electrical signals from the feedlines into radio frequency signals that can be transmitted through the antennas. The figure also shows a block diagram of the DUT, with various components such as the power amplifier, filters, and digital signal processing units. The layout and connections between the antennas and the RF chain suggest a design optimized for omnidirectional coverage, allowing the DUT to communicate effectively over a wide range of frequencies.\nFigure 5.1.3-3: Illustration of Sample DUT with three antenna panels\nThe beam peak search or spherical coverage test case of the DUT utilizing the black-box approach, i.e., none of the antenna offsets are known/declared, is illustrated in Figure 5.1.3-4. Here, the geometric centre of the DUT is aligned with the centre of the QZ (yellow circle). The (green) beam peak search grid points sample the EIRP around the DUT.\nFigure 5.1.3-4 illustrates the beam peak search of a sample DUT (Device Under Test) utilizing a black-box approach. The figure depicts the process of beamforming, where multiple beams are formed to focus on the DUT, with the aim of maximizing the received signal strength. The DUT is represented at the center, with the surrounding area representing the beamforming region. The beams are represented by lines emanating from the DUT, with the peak of each beam indicated by a dot. The goal is to identify the beam with the highest peak, which will provide the strongest signal to the DUT. The figure also shows the use of adaptive beamforming techniques, where the beam patterns are adjusted in real-time to optimize the signal quality.\nFigure 5.1.3-4: Illustration of beam peak search of sample DUT utilizing black-box approach.\nTest cases without a 3D scan, e.g., EIRP/EIS test case towards the known TX/RX beam peak direction, utilizing the black-box approach are illustrated in Figure 5.1.3-5. Here, the geometric centre of the DUT is aligned with the centre of the QZ (yellow circle) and the TX beam peak direction is known from a previous beam peak search measurement, e.g., from an IFF system. Hence, the single (green) FF grid point is aligned with the FF TX beam peak direction.\nFigure 5.1.3-5 illustrates a low UL power test case along the TX BP (Transmitter Base Port) direction of a sample DUT (Device Under Test) utilizing a black-box approach. The figure depicts the DUT, which is the central component, with various test scenarios and measurements being conducted on its input and output ports. The test aims to evaluate the device's performance under low power conditions, ensuring compliance with industry standards and optimizing the overall system efficiency. The black-box approach allows for a clear and unbiased analysis of the DUT's behavior, focusing on the functional aspects without interfering with the internal components.\nFigure 5.1.3-5: Illustration low UL power test case along TX BP direction of sample DUT utilizing black-box approach.\nFor the white-box measurement approach, the level of information provided in vendor declarations largely depends on the purpose of test case coverage. If the white-box approach is leveraged for all conformance test cases including the beam peak searches, the total number of panels and the phase centre offsets of each panel need to be declared. Additionally, vendors would have to declare which antenna panel is active for each grid point or test sectors so that the respective antenna panel is aligned with the centre of the QZ during testing. This approach is further illustrated in Figure 5.1.3-6. To sample EIRPs on all beam peak search grid points, three different device positions have to be applied, i.e., for the angular range covering the\n-\tred grid points (declared by OEM), the red antenna panel (location declared by OEM) has to be aligned with the centre of QZ (yellow circle)\n-\tpurple grid points (declared by OEM), the purple antenna panel (location declared by OEM) has to be aligned with the centre of QZ (yellow circle)\n-\tblue grid points (declared by OEM), the blue antenna panel (location declared by OEM) has to be aligned with the centre of QZ (yellow circle)\nFigure 5.1.3-6 illustrates the beam peak search of a sample DUT (Device Under Test) utilizing a white-box approach. The figure depicts the process of beamforming, where multiple beams are formed to focus on the DUT, and the peak signal strength is identified. This process is crucial for improving signal reception and reducing interference. The figure shows the use of multiple antennas at the base station and the receiver, which allows for the formation of multiple beams. The DUT is represented as a small square, and the beams are shown as lines emanating from the base station and receiver antennas. The figure also shows the use of signal processing techniques to identify the strongest signal and direct the beam accordingly. Overall, the figure provides a clear and concise overview of the beam peak search process in a white-box approach.\nFigure 5.1.3-6: Illustration of beam peak search of sample DUT utilizing white-box approach.\nIn summary, the information that would have to be declared by the OEMs if the white-box approach is utilized for all conformance test cases is tabulated in Table 5.1.3-1.\nTable 5.1.3-1: Sample Vendor Declaration for white box approach supporting all conformance test cases\n\nAssuming the enhanced test methodology needs to perform beam peak searches and a white box approach was selected, the DUT should be measured in several positions inside the test volume, where two options could be considered:\na.\tDUT is placed manually in the corresponding off-center positions. This will likely result in significant test time increase and additional MU due to inaccuracies in the alignment of the DUT.\nb.\tx-y-z positioning systems are needed to fully automate testing based on the knowledge of which antenna panel is active in any given UL/DL test direction, as outlined in Figure 5.1.3-6. This will in effect likely result in significant signal ripple and near field coupling effects which is expected to degrade the quality of QZ MU which could offset the offset MU a white box approach eliminates. Such positioning system will furthermore increase test system complexity from a SW and HW perspective as well as test time.\nTest cases without a 3D scan, e.g., EIRP/EIS test case towards the known TX/RX beam peak direction, utilizing the white-box approach is illustrated in Figure 5.1.3-7. Here, the phase centre of the red panel (yielding beam peak radiation) of the DUT is aligned with the centre of the QZ (yellow circle) and the TX beam peak direction is known from a previous beam peak search measurement; thus the single (green) grid point is aligned with the FF TX beam peak direction. In this case, only the location of the one antenna panel that yields the beam peak radiation would have to be declared. A sample declaration is shown in Table 5.1.3-2.\nFigure 5.1.3-7 illustrates a low UL power test case along the TX BP (Transmitter Baseband Path) direction of a sample DUT (Device Under Test) utilizing a white-box approach. The figure depicts the signal transmission process, starting from the TX BP, passing through various components such as the RF (Radio Frequency) chain, power amplifier, and filters, before reaching the antenna. The test case aims to evaluate the performance of the DUT under low power conditions, ensuring that it can efficiently transmit signals with minimal power consumption. The figure highlights the importance of optimizing the RF chain and power amplifier for energy efficiency and signal quality in wireless communication systems.\nFigure 5.1.3-7: Illustration of low UL power test case along TX BP direction of sample DUT utilizing white-box approach.\nTable 5.1.3-2: Sample Vendor Declaration for white-box approach supporting low UL power test cases\n\nTwo different black&white-box approaches could be further considered, i.e.,\n-\tExtensive Black&white-box approach: When the NF methodology is used for spherical coverage test cases and for beam peak searches, all active antenna locations are declared together with the angular ranges (theta, phi) each active antenna performs best (when compared to the remaining antenna panels, i.e., the vendor declaration is as outlined in Table 5.1.3-1. Very much similar to the white-box approach with the only difference that the geometric centre of DUT is aligned with the centre of QZ.\n-\tBlack&white box: When the NF methodology is used only for EIS based high DL power or EIRP/TRP based low UL power test cases, only the antenna location of the antenna that yields the beam peak needs to be declared, i.e., the vendor declaration is as outlined in Table 5.1.3-2. The geometric centre of DUT is aligned with the centre of QZ.\nFor test cases focused only on the for EIS based high DL power or EIRP/TRP based low UL power test cases, the key differences are illustrated in Figure 5.1.3-8 for the black-box approach (left), black&white-box approach (centre), and the white-box approach (right). While the black-box approach requires local searches to determine the NF test direction, the need for local searches for the black&white-box approach is FFS. No local search is necessary for the white-box approach.\nFor the spherical coverage test cases or the beam peak searches, the extensive black&white-box approach is further outlined in Figure 5.1.3-9. On the other hand, the black-box approach is outlined in Figure 5.1.3-4 while the white-box approach is outlined in Figure 5.1.3-6.\nFigure 5.1.3-8 illustrates the black-box, black-and-white-box, and white-box approaches for the low-UL power test case in a telecommunication system. The black-box approach focuses solely on the system's input and output behavior without considering internal workings. The black-and-white-box approach adds some level of understanding by identifying the system's internal components and their interactions. The white-box approach, on the other hand, provides a comprehensive understanding of the system's internal structure, allowing for detailed analysis and optimization. The figure highlights the importance of these different levels of understanding in assessing and improving the performance of telecommunication systems.\nFigure 5.1.3-8: Illustration of black-box approach (left), black&white-box approach (centre), and the white-box approach (right) for the low-UL power test case.\nFigure 5.1.3-9 illustrates the beam peak search or beam peak search of a sample DUT (Device Under Test) utilizing an extensive black&white-box approach. The figure depicts the process of beamforming, which involves directing radio frequency (RF) signals towards the intended receiver with minimal interference from other signals. The DUT is shown at the center, with multiple beams emanating from the base station (BS) towards it. The BS is equipped with a phased array antenna, which allows for precise control of the beams' direction and power. The figure also shows the use of a beamformer, which is a device that processes the received signals to enhance the desired signal and suppress the interference. The result is a more efficient and reliable communication link between the BS and the DUT.\nFigure 5.1.3-9: Illustration of beam peak search or beam peak search of sample DUT utilizing extensive black&white-box approach\nFor white box testing, the minimum radius of the NF probe antenna from the centre of the quiet zone generally must exceed the maximum diameter of the device, as illustrated in Figure 5.1.3-10, to prevent interference of the near field scanning probe with the DUT. While this requirement of the NF range length having to exceed the maximum diameter of the DUT is generally applicable to TRP where the NF Probe antenna needs to perform a full 3D scan around the DUT, this could very well be applicable to single-directional measurements as well, as illustrated in Figure 5.1.3-10 using a PC1 CPE as an example. Similar restrictions apply when testing using ETC enclosures surrounding the DUT.\nFigure 5.1.3-10 illustrates the minimal range length of NF Systems when employing white box testing, showcasing the impact of various factors such as signal strength, interference, and transmission distance on network performance. The figure highlights the importance of optimizing network configurations and infrastructure to ensure reliable and efficient communication within the specified range. Key elements include the transmitter, receiver, and intermediate nodes, as well as the transmission medium and potential obstacles that may affect signal propagation.\nFigure 5.1.3-10: Illustration of min. Range length of NF Systems when applying white box testing\nFigure 5.1.3-11 illustrates the minimum range length for Network Function Virtualization (NFV) systems using a Point-to-Point (P2P) CPE as an example. The figure depicts the connection between the Central Office (CO) and the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) through a series of network elements, including the Network Functions Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI), Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), and Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs). The figure highlights the importance of optimizing the network layout and the placement of VNFs to ensure the minimum range length is met, which is crucial for maintaining network performance and reliability.\nFigure 5.1.3-11: Illustration of min. Range length for NF Systems using PC1 CPE as example.\nThe corresponding FF and NF min. range lengths are tabulated for selected FR2 frequencies in Table 5.1.3-3 for PC3 devices with fixed D=5cm.\nTable 5.1.3-3: Minimum FF and NF Range Lengths for black box and white box conditions for PC3 devices\nTable 5.1.3-4 summarizes the path loss comparison between “white box” and “black box” configuration across IFF/DFF and NF system types.\nTable 5.1.3-4: Path loss comparison between “white box” and “black box” configuration\n\nBased on the analysis shown in Table 5.1.3-4, it can be concluded that a “white box” is not deemed a feasible enhancement of the methodology.\nAdditionally, since the beam peak searches and the spherical coverage test cases are not part of the low UL/high DL power test cases and given the complexity of the vendor declaration of the extensive black&white-box approach, it can be concluded that the extensive black&white-box approach is not deemed a feasible enhancement of the methodology.\n",

This FF probe is used for the low UL/high DL power test cases to steer and lock the beam in the known FF direction before the NF measurements are performed with a NF probe that exhibits much lower free-space path losses. An example test setup of such a hybrid system is shown in Figure 5.1.4-1.\nThe main differences between the three measurement approaches are outlined in Table 5.1.4-1.\nTable 5.1.4-1: Main differences between CFFDNF and CFFNF measurement approaches\n\nFigure 5.1.4-1 illustrates a hybrid network function (NF) and information flow (I) (FF) test setup designed for NF measurements. The figure showcases a network environment with multiple components, including a central processing unit (CPU), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), and a network interface card (NIC). The setup demonstrates the integration of NF and IFF technologies, highlighting their interaction and performance in a real-world scenario. The figure emphasizes the importance of such tests in validating the efficiency and effectiveness of NF-based solutions in modern networking systems.\nFigure 5.1.4-1: Hybrid NF/(I)FF test setup suitable for NF measurements\nIn a NF system, the NF beam peak direction for an offset antenna is not necessarily the same as the FF beam peak direction; however, the knowledge of the antenna phase centre offset, i.e., black&white-box approach, can be leveraged to measure at the NF beam peak direction as illustrated in 5.1.4-2. The knowledge of the offset together with the probe antenna pattern will allow the calculation of the optimized DUT orientation to optimize the NF measurement. The beam peak direction in the NF can either be calculated or determined via a local search.\nFigure 5.1.4-2 illustrates the process of network function (NF) testing using the black-box and white-box approaches. The figure depicts a network with multiple nodes, including the NF under test, which is highlighted in the center. The black-box approach involves testing the NF's functionality by sending input and observing the output, without examining the internal workings. In contrast, the white-box approach allows for deeper analysis, as it includes visibility into the NF's internal components and their interactions. The figure emphasizes the importance of both approaches in ensuring the quality and reliability of network functions.

A beam lock activation via the UBF makes sure that the UE no longer changes its antenna pattern when the NF measurement probe is used to perform the measurements with significantly reduced free-space path losses compared to existing IFF systems.\nThe CFFDNF approach and test steps for EIRP/EIS/TRP follow those for IFF/DFF outlined in Annex K [6] with the exception that the minimum range length is reduced. The minimum number of TRP grid points, required grid point spacing, and the effect of compensation of the declared/known offset is further outlined in this this clause.\nThe asymptotic expansion approach for CFFNF that is using measurements\n-\tat three different radii including local searches around the FF beam peak direction (black-box approach) or\n-\tat two different radii without local searches as the NF beam peak direction can be calculated (black&white-box approach)\nis primarily meant to estimate the FF EIRP/EIS at the beam peak with NF EIRP/EIS measurements performed in the radiative NF instead of the reactive NF. This expansion approach is not suitable to determine the FF pattern given the required overhead with the measurements at multiple radii.\nThe asymptotic expansion approach is based on the superposition approach\n\nwith\n-\tSignal(𝜃, ϕ): signal at measurement grid point (𝜃, ϕ, 𝑟)\n-\t: complex coefficient for kth antenna array element\n-\t: field pattern for kth antenna element\n-\t: field pattern for probe antenna\n-\t(𝜃k, ϕk): EL and AZ angles of kth antenna element with respect to measurement grid point (𝜃, ϕ, 𝑟)\n-\t(𝛼k, 𝛽k): EL and AZ angles of probe antenna with respect to the kth antenna element\n-\t: wavelength\n-\t: distance between kth antenna element to measurement grid point (𝜃, ϕ, 𝑟)\n-\tr: range length/measurement distance between centre of QZ and probe antenna\n-\t: amplitude loss caused by propagation on length of\n-\t: the phase variation caused by propagation on length of\nThe estimate of the FF EIRP based on NF measurements, p(d), can be expressed as follows\n\nwith\n\nwhere EIRP(df) is the estimated EIRP in the far-field and df is the distance between the phase centre of the antenna array and the far-field beam peak at range length r (in the FF: r ~ df) while p(d1) is the measured power with the probe antenna at a near-field distance d1 (measured from the phase centre of the antenna array to probe antenna), ∂p/∂d is the derivative of power p to distance d. Because the near-field distance d1 is unknown for the black box approach, measurements of the EIRP at multiple measurement distances are needed to determine the parameters of the ∂p/∂d derivative and the first near-field distance d1.\nFollowing the implementation of the CFFNF simulations and an in-depth analysis of the derivative of the superposition expression above, the approximation of normalized power to distance ∂p/∂d was determined to be\n\nwhich yields dependency of normalized power to d of\n\nThis approximation in turn corresponds to a power (field) dependence in the NF of 1/r4 (1/r2) which is commonly observed in the radiative NF. CST simulations were used to further support this formulation. Here, an 8x2 antenna array, placed at (0,0,0), was evaluated. Two measurements at r1 and r2 were used to estimate the asymptotic expansion coefficients bi; this allowed to estimate the power/EIRP at various distances which was can be compared with actual CST simulations at those distances. The behaviour and the normalized power (compensating the path loss) estimated from two sets of two measurements at (r1, r2) of (7.5cm, 9.5cm) and (20cm, 22cm) simulated at various distances (>r2) are shown in Figure 5.1.4.1-1.\n\nFigure 5.1.4.1-1 presents a graphical representation of normalized power and its derivative as a function of transformed distance. The figure illustrates the evaluation of Normalized Field (NF) at two distinct distances, 7.5 cm and 20 cm, with corresponding transformations at 8.5 cm and 21 cm.

The figure outlines the process, which involves setting up a test environment with a Device Under Test (DUT) and a test setup. The DUT is connected to the test setup, which includes a base station, a test antenna, and a signal analyzer. The test steps are depicted in a sequence, starting with the setup of the test environment and ending with the analysis of the test results. The figure highlights the importance of accurate antenna phase center offset measurements in ensuring reliable and efficient device-to-device communication.\nFigure 5.1.4.2-1: Test Steps for CFFDNF testing of DUTs with known antenna phase centre offset (black&white-box approach).\nFor the CFFNF methodology that supports both the black-box and the black&white-box approach, the initial test steps are the same as steps 1-3 in Figure 5.1.4.2-1. The test steps for the NF measurement portion of the black-box approach are further outlined in Figure 5.1.4.2-2 while the NF test steps for the black&white-box approach are outlined in Figure 5.1.4.2-3. The diagrams on the right of Figure 5.1.4.2-2 illustrate the different local searches required for the measurements at each of the three radii. The measurements at the very first radius r1 require a wide sector of grid points around the known FF beam peak direction big enough so that the local/NF beam peak is captured properly. For the initial local search at r1=20cm, the width of the sector is about ±40o which can be covered using coarse and fine scans to further reduce the number of points. On the other hand, the sector of grid points for measurements at radius r2 and r3 can be significantly smaller as only a small region around the local NF beam peak found at r1 is needed.\nFigure 5.1.4.2-2 illustrates the additional CFFNF test steps with asymptotic expansion transform utilizing the black-box approach. The figure depicts the process flow of the test steps, starting with the input data, which undergoes a series of transformations and analyses. The black-box approach is employed to evaluate the system's performance, focusing on the outputs without delving into the internal workings. The figure emphasizes the importance of these test steps in ensuring the quality and reliability of the system.\nFigure 5.1.4.2-2: Illustration of the additional CFFNF test steps with asymptotic expansion transform utilizing the black-box approach.\nFigure 5.1.4.2-3 illustrates the additional CFFNF test steps with asymptotic expansion transform utilizing the black&white-box approach.

The black&white-box approach is employed to evaluate the system's performance, with the figure showing the transformation of input signals through various stages of the test process. The figure highlights the importance of these test steps in ensuring the quality and reliability of telecommunication systems.\nFigure 5.1.4.2-3: Illustration of the additional CFFNF test steps with asymptotic expansion transform utilizing the black&white-box approach.\nFor the CFFdeltaNF methodology that supports the black-box approach, the initial test steps are the same as steps 1-3 in Figure 5.1.4.2-1. The additional test steps for the NF relative and final measurement portion of the black-box approach are further outlined in Figure 5.1.4.2-4. The diagrams on the right of Figure 5.1.4.2-4 illustrate the local search required for the measurements in NF. At r=35cm, the width of the sector is about ±20o which can be covered using coarse and fine scans to further reduce the number of points.\nFigure 5.1.4.2-4 illustrates the additional CFFdeltaNF test steps utilizing the black-box approach, which assesses the performance of a telecommunication system by simulating the behavior of a black-box component. The figure depicts the steps involved in this test, including the input and output interfaces, as well as the internal processing that occurs within the component. The test is designed to evaluate the system's performance under various conditions, such as different input data sets and varying processing speeds. The results of this test can be used to identify potential issues and improve the overall performance of the telecommunication system.\nFigure 5.1.4.2-4: Illustration of the additional CFFdeltaNF test steps utilizing the black-box approach.\nThe sample sequence of test steps for the CFFDNF test methodology with the black&white-box approach is as follows (aligned in principle with Clause K.1.3 of [6]):\n1.\tConnect the SS (System Simulator) with the DUT through the FF measurement antenna with polarization reference PolLink to form the TX beam towards the FF TX beam peak direction.

Since the beam peak search and spherical coverage analyses are performed with the FF probe, beam steering assumptions are not required here. The definitions of offsets (xoffset/yoffset/zoffset), maximum offsets (≤12.5cm for PC3 and ≤10cm for PC1), array configurations (PC3: 8x2 and 4x1, PC1: 12x12), and range lengths are summarized in Table 5.1.4.3-1.\nThe FF 8x2 and 4x1 array patterns with the 90o/90o HPBW assumption are shown in Figure 5.1.4.4-1.\nFigure 5.1.4.4-1 illustrates the antenna patterns of an 8x2 antenna array configuration and a 4x1 antenna array configuration, both with a 90-degree horizontal and vertical half-power beamwidth (HPBW). The left side of the figure shows the pattern for the 8x2 configuration, which consists of eight antennas arranged in two rows, each row containing four antennas. The right side of the figure shows the pattern for the 4x1 configuration, which consists of four antennas arranged in a single row. The patterns demonstrate how the antenna array's radiation pattern spreads out from the center, with the maximum radiation intensity occurring at the center and decreasing as the distance from the center increases. The figure is useful for understanding how the antenna array's radiation pattern affects the signal coverage and reception in different directions.Figure 5.1.4.4-1 illustrates the antenna patterns of an 8x2 antenna array configuration and a 4x1 antenna array configuration, both with a 90-degree horizontal and vertical half-power beamwidth (HPBW).

The EIRP simulations were performed using Matlab and CST.\nThe simulations assume that the FF beam peak direction of the DUT is known for the sample DUT considered.\nFor the statistical analyses using Matlab, a total of 100,000 simulations with random and uniformly spaced offsets were performed. These offsets were varied between 0 to 12.5cm (10cm) in x and from -12.5cm (-10cm) to 12.5cm (10cm) in y and z for PC3 (PC1) while making sure that the maximum radial offset cannot exceed 12.5cm (10cm). The offsets in x were limited to positive values since it is assumed that the front antenna of the DUT is always in the upper hemisphere since the geometric centre of the device is aligned with the centre of the QZ. A sample set of 100,000 random offsets is visualized in Figure 5.1.4.4-2. Histograms of the respective offset radii, and offsets in x, y, and z are shown in Figure 5.1.4.4-3.\nFigure 5.1.4.4-2 presents a visual representation of 100,000 random offsets uniformly spaced within a 12.5cm range, all situated within a single hemisphere. This figure serves as a fundamental tool in understanding the distribution and arrangement of these offsets, which are crucial for various applications in telecommunication, such as signal processing and antenna design. The uniform spacing of the offsets ensures that the distribution is statistically representative and can be used to model and analyze complex telecommunication systems.\nFigure 5.1.4.4-2: Illustration of 100,000 random offsets uniformly spaced within 12.5cm in a single hemisphere.\nFigure 5.1.4.4-3 presents histograms of 100,000 random offsets uniformly spaced within 12.5cm in a single hemisphere, illustrating the distribution of these offsets. The histograms show the frequency of occurrence for each offset value, providing insights into the spatial distribution of the random offsets. This information is crucial for understanding the performance and reliability of telecommunication systems, as it helps in identifying potential interference and optimizing network configurations.\nFigure 5.1.4.4-3: Histograms of 100,000 random offsets uniformly spaced within 12.5cm in a single hemisphere.\nSince each of the offsets are known/declared, the offset can be properly compensated, i.e., the pathloss applied to the EIRP measurements is not referenced to the centre of QZ but to the phase centre of the active antenna array. The results in this clause focus only on the EIRP results after the path loss with respect to the offset antenna array was compensated.\nAdditionally, for the best/optimized measurement uncertainties, the probe antenna pattern/gain must be compensated since the array offsets can result in the NF beam peak to be observed from directions with large deviations from the peak gain direction of the measurement probe/horn as illustrated in Figure 5.1.4-2. In the simulations, probe pattern/gain compensation can be modelled in the simplest approximation by assuming an omnidirectional pattern of the probe. To quantify the effect of not compensating the probe antenna pattern, this section will present measurement uncertainties for a typical horn antenna. For these simulations, a symmetric pattern of a horn antenna with ~50o HPBW pattern is assumed as plotted in Figure 5.1.4.4-4, which was obtained using the following Matlab commands:\nProbeTheta=-180:1:180;\nHPBW=50;\nProbePattern_norm=-12*(ProbeTheta/HPBW);\n\nFigure 5.1.4.4-4 presents an assumed measurement probe antenna pattern, illustrating the radiation pattern of a telecommunication device. The pattern is characterized by a main lobe, side lobes, and a null, which are essential for understanding the device's radiation characteristics. The main lobe represents the strongest radiation direction, while the side lobes indicate the device's ability to radiate in multiple directions. The null, or area of no radiation, is crucial for avoiding interference with other devices. This pattern is crucial for optimizing the placement and orientation of the antenna to maximize signal strength and minimize interference.\nFigure 5.1.4.4-4: Assumed measurement probe antenna pattern.\nThe NF beam peak direction, illustrated in Figure 5.1.4-2, was calculated using the known FF beam peak direction, the offset of the antenna array, and the range length.\nA histogram of the 100k EIRP simulations for 4 different NF range lengths (20cm, 25cm, 30cm, 45cm) and the 20m FF range lengths is shown in Figure 5.1.4.4-5 and the statistical results of these simulations are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.4-1. These results assume that the antenna array offsets and the probe pattern/gain were compensated.\nFigure 5.1.4.4-5 presents a histogram of 100,000 EIRP (Effective Isotropic Radiated Power) CFFDNF (Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access) simulations conducted using a black-and-white-box approach.

The figure illustrates the impact of antenna offset and probe pattern compensation on the EIRP, which is crucial for optimizing wireless communication systems.Figure 5.1.4.4-6 presents two simulations of antenna configurations for a 20cm range length, with an 8x2 antenna configuration.

The figure illustrates the impact of antenna offset and probe pattern compensation on the EIRP, which is crucial for optimizing wireless communication systems.\nFigure 5.1.4.4-6: Illustration of simulations for the 20cm range length with 8x2 antenna configuration resulting in smallest (left) and largest (right) EIRPs after antenna offset and probe pattern compensation.\nWhen the antenna array offset is towards the probe antenna, shown in the left plot of Figure 5.1.4.4-6, the EIRP without the offset compensation is very high (20.7dBm in this example); however, the offset compensation, i.e., applying the pathloss between the probe antenna and the active antenna array, helps to significantly improve the EIRP measurement uncertainty with respect to the EIRP measured in the FF.\nOnce the array offsets and the probe antenna pattern are compensated in the NF with CFFDNF methodology assuming the black&white-box approach, almost insignificant measurement uncertainties for PC3 devices can be observed at 45cm. At distances less than 45cm, measurement uncertainties must be taken into account.\nWhen the probe pattern/gain is not compensated, a much larger variation of the measured EIRP results is expected due to the large off broadside directions of the antenna panels from the probe antenna, as illustrated schematically in Figure 5.1.4-2. This is further quantified in Figure 5.1.4.4-6 and in Table 5.1.4.4-2 for the same simulations. These results assume that the antenna array offsets are compensated while the probe pattern/gain were not compensated, i.e., the pattern in Figure 5.1.4.4-4 was applied to the simulations.\nFigure 5.1.4.4-7 presents a histogram of 100,000 EIRP (Effective Isotropic Radiated Power) CFFDNF (Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access) simulations conducted using a black-and-white-box approach. The simulations involved an 8x2 antenna array with random offsets uniformly distributed within 12.5 cm in a single hemisphere. The antenna array offsets were compensated, while the probe pattern and gain were not. The histogram provides a visual representation of the distribution of EIRP values across the simulations, offering valuable insights into the performance of the CFFDNF system under various conditions.\nFigure 5.1.4.4-7: Histogram of 100,000 EIRP CFFDNF simulations based on black&white-box approach with random 8x2 antenna array offsets uniformly spaced within 12.5cm in a single hemisphere.

The visualization of 100k vs 1k random offsets is illustrated in Figure 5.1.4.4-8. Clearly, the 100k offsets are uniformly distributed in the hemisphere while the random 250 and 1k offsets are distributed rather sparsely.\nFigure 5.1.4.4-8 presents a comparison of signal strength at different offsets, with 100k, 1k, and 250 offsets represented on the x-axis. The y-axis indicates signal strength in decibels (dB). The left graph shows a 100k offset, the middle graph shows a 1k offset, and the right graph shows a 250 offset. The three graphs demonstrate how signal strength varies with different offsets, providing valuable insights into signal propagation and interference patterns.

The results show that regardless of range length and antenna configuration, the difference in mean error and standard deviation is almost insignificant.\n\nTable 5.1.4.4-3: Statistical results of 100k vs 1k vs 250 EIRP CFFDNF offset simulations based on black&white-box approach with random antenna array offsets uniformly spaced within 12.5cm (PC3)/10cm (PC1) in a single hemisphere. The antenna array offsets were compensated.\n\nAnother investigation focused on the MUs at two different frequencies at opposite ends of FR2, i.e., 28GHz and 49GHz using the same fixed range lengths. The simulation results are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.4-5 which show that the MUs at 28GHz are larger than at 49GHz.\nAs outlined in Table 5.1.4.4-4 below, the range lengths as a function of wavelength are different between those two frequencies. The MUs are smaller for 49GHz when compared to 28GHz since the distances in wavelength are larger for the 40GHz case.\nTable 5.1.4.4-4: Range length vs frequency\n\nTable 5.1.4.4-5: Statistical results of 28GHz vs 49GHz EIRP CFFDNF offset simulations based on black&white-box approach with random antenna array offsets uniformly spaced within 12.5cm (PC3)/10cm (PC1) in a single\n\nAnother investigation focused on whether Matlab which is using an analytical approximation of the radiation pattern of the antenna arrays in the NF and FF based on the superposition approach  yields similar uncertainties as a full EM simulation tool, i.e., CST, which is calculating the NF and FF patterns based on a numerical approach. Figure 5.1.4.4-9 illustrates the differences of the simulated 8x2 antenna patterns between Matlab (solid lines) and CST (dashed lines) both for the FF interface distance of 2D2/, i.e., 47cm at 28GHz with D=5cm, (red lines) and the NF interface distance of , i.e., 7cm at 28GHz with D=5cm, (blue lines) in two principal cuts. Clearly, the agreement between Matlab and CST simulations of a dipole-based antenna element array placed over a ground plane is very good in both NF and FF. The CST analyses which used a grid size of 1o in  and . Those results are summarized in Table 5.1.4.4-6 and assume that array offsets and the feed probe have been compensated. The simulations with the limited number of offsets assumed the same offsets were used in Matlab and CST. Overall, these results show that were good agreement between 100k and the limited number of offsets can be achieved and that the Matlab and CST simulations yield excellent agreement.\nFigure 5.1.4.4-9 compares the antenna patterns generated by CST and Matlab for a 2x2 MIMO antenna system. The graph displays the radiation patterns in the horizontal plane, with the y-axis representing the amplitude of the electric field and the x-axis representing the angle in degrees. The CST simulation results are shown in blue, while the Matlab simulation results are depicted in red. The two sets of data closely match each other, indicating the accuracy of both software tools in modeling the antenna's radiation pattern. The comparison highlights the consistency between the two simulations, providing confidence in the predictions made by each software for the given antenna configuration.\nFigure 5.1.4.4-9: Comparison of CST and Matlab 8x2 antenna pattern.\n\nTable 5.1.4.4-6: Statistical results of EIRP CFFDNF simulations performed with Matlab and CST.\n\nThe results for the other antenna configurations are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.4-7.\n\nTable 5.1.4.4-7: Statistical results of 100,000 EIRP CFFDNF simulations based on black&white-box approach with random antenna array offsets uniformly spaced within 12.5cm (PC3)/10cm (PC1) in a single hemisphere.

The findings for measurement uncertainties when testing TRP in the near field using CFFDNF are presented next.\nAn analysis of the impact on measurement uncertainty by testing TRP in the NF was performed according to the assumption for TRP offsets in Table 5.1.2.1-1.  In this analysis, near-field effects of the antenna pattern were taken into account. Figure 5.1.4.4-10 below illustrates the differences in the 8x2 antenna pattern at the 2D2/λ distance (a) and at 1/8th of that distance (b).\nFigure 5.1.4.4- 10 presents the radiation pattern of an 8x2 antenna array at two distinct distances. On the left, the pattern is shown at a 2D 2 / λ FF distance, while on the right, it is depicted at a 1/8 th of FF distance. The radiation pattern illustrates how the antenna array's signal strength varies with distance, with the pattern becoming more concentrated at closer distances and spreading out as the distance increases. This information is crucial for understanding how the antenna array's performance is affected by its position relative to the transmitter and receiver.Figure 5.1.4.4-10 presents the radiation pattern of an 8x2 antenna array at two distinct distances, illustrating how the signal strength varies with distance. On the left, the pattern is shown at a 2D 2 / λ FF distance, while on the right, it is depicted at a 1/8 th of FF distance. The radiation pattern becomes more concentrated at closer distances and spreads out as the distance increases, providing valuable insights into the antenna array's performance relative to the transmitter and receiver. This information is crucial for optimizing the antenna array's positioning and signal strength in various scenarios.\nFigure 5.1.4.4-10: Radiation pattern of the 8x2 antenna array at 2D2/λ FF distance (left) and in NF at 1/8th of FF distance (right)\nTable 5.1.4.4-9 below summarizes the impact of the approaches with and without offset correction on TRP MU.\nTable 5.1.4.4-9: Impact of TRP measurement with and without offset correction on MU\nAdditionally, CDF curves for the various simulation results are presented in Figure 5.1.4.4-11 below.\nFigure 5.1.4.4-1 illustrates the distribution of simulated TRP measurements with and without offset correction. The figure presents two sets of data, one representing the raw measurements and the other showing the corrected values. The x-axis represents the frequency range, while the y-axis denotes the TRP values. The comparison between the two sets of data highlights the impact of offset correction on the accuracy of TRP measurements, emphasizing its importance in signal processing and communication systems.\nFigure 5.1.4.4-11: Distribution of simulated TRP measurements with and without offset correction\nNext, TRP simulation results are presented for the CFFDNF methodology for PC1 based on the 12x12 antenna configuration following the assumptions outlined in Section 5.1.4.3. The Matlab simulation results are summarized in Table 5.1.4.4-10 with and without path loss correction. For these simulations, a uniform angular grid spacing was applied in  and to the TRP grid. It should be noted that the antenna array offset must be known/declared when the path loss correction is applied.\nTable 5.1.4.4-10: CFFDNF TRP simulation results with and without path loss correction for PC1 devices (12x12 antenna configuration) with a uniform angular spacing in  and .\n\nFor PC1, TRP test cases with a uniform angular spacing in  and  do not require additional measurement uncertainty due to reduced range length for\n-\trange lengths exceeding 20cm if the path loss correction is applied for measurement grids with step size of at most 5o (unique number of grid points: 2522)\n-\tfor range lengths exceeding 35cm if the path loss correction is not applied for measurement grids with step size of at most 5o (unique number of grid points: 2522)\nGiven the large number of grid points, additional test time reduction techniques based on non-uniform grids were investigated. The focus of this investigation is for the antenna array offset applied, i.e., the offset must be known/declared which can be used to determine the NF beam peak direction. The idea here is to apply a fine grid around the NF beam peak direction to capture the main portion of the very directive beam while a coarse grid around the remaining portion of the sphere is applied. This is further illustrated in Figure 5.1.4.4-12 with the following non-uniform TRP grid assumptions:\n-\tThe known NF beam is shown with the large grey dot. On top, the NF beam peak is assumed at (0o,0o) while the NF beam peak on the bottom is assumed at (45o,45o).\n-\tThe red grid points are within a ±20o cone centred around the NF beam peak with ==2.5o.\n-\tThe cyan grid points are outside a ±20o cone centred around the NF beam peak with ==10o.\n\nFigure 5.1.4.4-12 presents a visualization of non-uniform TRP (Transmission Ray Path) grids for a NF (Network Function) beam at two distinct angles: (0 o ,0 o ) on the top and (45 o ,45 o ) on the bottom. The grid points are color-coded to indicate their position relative to the conical NF beam peak region. The TRP grids are non-uniform, suggesting that the beam's coverage and strength vary across different locations. This figure is crucial for understanding the performance and coverage of the NF beam in a given area, as it helps in identifying areas with optimal signal strength and those that may require additional resources or adjustments to the network configuration.Figure 5.1.4.4-12 presents a visualization of non-uniform TRP (Transmission Ray Path) grids for a NF (Network Function) beam at two distinct angles: (0 o ,0 o ) on the top and (45 o ,45 o ) on the bottom. The grid points are color-coded to indicate their position relative to the conical NF beam peak region. The TRP grids are non-uniform, suggesting that the beam's coverage and strength vary across different locations. This figure is crucial for understanding the performance and coverage of the NF beam in a given area, as it helps in identifying areas with optimal signal strength and those that may require additional resources or adjustments to the network configuration.\nFigure 5.1.4.4-12: Visualization of non-uniform TRP grids for NF beam at (0o,0o) on top and at (45o,45o) on bottom. Grid points in cyan (red) are outside (inside) the conical NF beam peak region.\nSimulation with 2000 random offsets up to 10cm were performed together with random permutations of the beam peak direction (rotation in , , and twist  as outlined in Clause G.1 of [3]). Table 5.1.4.4-11 shows the simulation results for the non-uniform measurement grids considered the most suitable for PC1 devices. The average number of unique grid points based on all simulations investigated is ~900 which shows a significant test time reduction with the same TRP MUs as the 5o measurement grid with uniform spacing in  and , Table 5.1.4.4-10. For PC1, TRP test cases with a non-uniform angular spacing in  and  do not require additional measurement uncertainty due to reduced range length for range lengths exceeding 20cm if the path loss correction is applied for measurement grids with step size of 2.5o within ±20o of the NF beam peak and step size of 10o outside ±20o of the NF beam peak.\nTable 5.1.4.4-11: CFFDNF TRP simulation results with path loss correction for PC1 devices (12x12 antenna configuration) using non-uniform measurement grids.\n\nSimilar simulations were performed for PC3 devices with the 8x2 antenna configuration with random offsets up to 12.5cm. The results for the non-uniform grids are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.4-12.\nTable 5.1.4.4-12: CFFDNF TRP simulation results with path loss correction for PC3 devices (8x2 antenna configuration) using non-uniform measurement grids.\n\nFor PC3, TRP test cases with a non-uniform angular spacing in  and  do not require additional measurement uncertainty due to reduced range length for range lengths exceeding 20cm if the path loss correction is applied for measurement grids with step size of 5o within ±30o of the NF beam peak and step size of 15o outside ±30o of the NF beam peak.\nThe comparison of the TRP measurement grid parameters and the min. number of grid points are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.4-13 when the antenna array offset is known and compensated with angular grid spacings placed uniformly and non-uniformly in  and . Clearly, the non-uniform TRP measurement grid approach is especially beneficial in terms of test time reduction. The TRP calculation is left to the system vendor as there are different approaches to determine TRP, e.g., interpolation of all results to the fine grid vs partial TRPs calculated within the cone and outside the cone.\nTable 5.1.4.4-13: Comparison of the TRP measurement grid parameters for PC3 and PC1 including potential test time improvement. The simulations assume the offset is known/declared and the path loss correction was applied.\n\nAdditional simulations were performed based on the assumption that the DUT changes the antenna configuration between high-UL power operation, e.g., 8x2 configuration, and low-UL power operation, e.g., 4x1, 1x2, 1x1. Sample configurations of the active antenna elements placed near the edge and the centre are visualized in Figure 5.1.4.4-13 for the 8x2 antenna configuration.\nFigure 5.1.4.4-13 illustrates a 8x2 configuration for high UL power operation on the left, showcasing the arrangement of antennas and transceivers. On the right, various sample configurations for low UL power operation are depicted, highlighting different antenna and transceiver combinations. This figure is essential for understanding the impact of antenna and transceiver configurations on overall system performance, particularly in terms of uplink power efficiency.\nFigure 5.1.4.4-13: 8x2 configuration for high UL power operation (left) and sample configurations for low UL power operation\nThe following high-level procedure for the CFFDNF test methodology as presented in clause 5.1.4.2 for the black&white-box approach was used:\n-\tStep 1: form the beam towards FF antenna in the Tx beam peak direction for the higher array order, i.e. 8x2, then activate UBF.\n-\tStep 2: set the NF probe antenna towards the NF TX beam peak direction, determined from the antenna offset, range length, and FF beam peak direction for the higher array order, i.e., 8x2.\n-\tStep 3: set UE array to transmit with the lower power mode, i.e., by reducing the number of active elements.\n-\tStep 4: Measure NF power of the UE for the lower power mode in the NF beam peak direction determined in Step 2.\n-\tStep 5: Calculate the EIRP from the NF power in Step 4 by:\n-\tAdding the composite loss to the centre of the QZ\n-\tCompensate the actual measurement distance to the centre of the UE array, using the 8x2 order\n-\tApplying the probe antenna NF correction.\nThe simulation results from two companies are for the steps outlined above and the PC3 worst-case array assumption of 8x2 and the 0.2m NF range length are shown in Table 5.1.4.4-14. It can be observed that\n-\tThe MUs for the case when the antenna array does not change its antenna configuration, i.e., the low-UL and high-UL configuration is 8x2, matches the MU presented in Table 5.1.4.4-1\n-\tThe MUs for the sub-array configurations, i.e., {4x1, 1x1, 1x2}, are the same or generally smaller than the MU for the 8x2 case\nTable 5.1.4.4-14: CFFDNF simulation results utilizing black&white-box with antenna array offset and feed antenna pattern compensated based on the assumption that the antenna configuration could change from 8x2 (high-UL power configuration).\n\nSeparate analyses were performed that take the same antenna array offsets into account but instead of determining the NF beam peak direction and the applying the path loss compensation with respect to the phase centre of the 8x2 antenna array, the NF beam peak direction and offset compensation was based on the centre of the sub-antenna array configuration {4x1, 1x1, 1x2}. These results are presented in the third row of the table above. Clearly, the MUs for the 4x1 configuration match the MUs presented in Table 5.1.4.4-7.\nSimilar simulations were performed for the 12x12 (PC1) baseline/high-UL power configuration and various {8x2, 4x1, 1x1, 1x2} sub-array configurations for the low-UL power operation; those simulations are shown in Table 5.1.4.4-15.\nTable 5.1.4.4-15: CFFDNF simulation results utilizing black&white-box with antenna array offset and feed antenna pattern compensated based on the assumption that the antenna configuration could change from 12x12 (high-UL power configuration).\n\nSimilar observations as for the PC3 analyses can be drawn:\n-\tThe MUs for the case when the antenna array does not change its antenna configuration, i.e., the low-UL and high-UL configuration is 12x12, matches the MU presented earlier which is captured in Table 5.1.4.4-3\n-\tThe MUs for the sub-array configurations, i.e., {8x2, 4x1, 1x1, 1x2}, are smaller than the MU for the 12x12 case (which is serving as the reference for PC1 MU purposes)\n-\tThe MUs for the case when the actual offset position of the sub-array is declared match the MUs determined in previous simulations, e.g., the MUs for the 8x2 antenna and for 0.45cm range length match the MUs for the 8x2 antenna array shown in Table 5.1.4.4-3.\n-\tIt can therefore be concluded that for CFFDNF (with black&white-box approach):If the phase centre of the reference antenna array (high UL-power operation: 8x2 for PC3, 12x12 for PC1) is declared, the previously determined MUs hold if the antenna changes its configuration for the low-UL power operation\n-\tIf the phase centre of the sub-antenna array used for low-UL power operation is declared, the previously determined MUs can be further reduced\nIn this clause, results for near-field and far-field simulations of Ny x Nz antenna arrays for the CFFNF methodology based on the black&white-box approach, i.e., the location of active antenna panel for the FF beam peak direction is known/declared, are presented. The simulation assumptions are, for the most part, the same as those in Table 5.1.4.3-1.\nInitial simulations were performed with an EM simulator, CST. The grid size used for the CST simulations had step sizes of 1o in  and . Given the previous observation regarding the need to offset the probe pattern, the simulations for CFFNF using black&white approach only focused on the feed probe pattern compensated.\nThe CFFNF results are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.5-1 for 8x2 (PC3) and in Table 5.1.4.5-2 for 12x12 (PC1) and compared with the CFFDNF results (same as those in Table 5.1.4.4-8). Clearly, the measurement at the additional radius r2 significantly reduces the measurement uncertainties and allows EIRP/EIS measurements of PC3 (PC1) devices at 21cm (31cm) range length without additional (with very small) MU. These simulations assume that r2 is either r2=r1+1cm or r2=r1+2cm.\nSubsequent simulations were performed with Matlab based on the same assumptions. The PC3 results are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.5-3 with results from two different companies while the PC1 results are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.5-4.\nTable 5.1.4.5-1: Statistical results of 500 EIRP CFFNF & CFFDNF CST simulations based on black&white-box approach with random 8x2 antenna array offsets uniformly spaced within 12.5cm in a single hemisphere. The antenna array offsets and probe pattern were compensated.\n\nTable 5.1.4.5-2: Statistical results of 500 EIRP CFFNF & CFFDNF CST simulations based on black&white-box approach with random 12x12 antenna array offsets uniformly spaced within 10cm in a single hemisphere. The antenna array offsets and probe pattern were compensated.\n\nTable 5.1.4.5-3: Statistical results of EIRP CFFNF offset simulations based on black&white-box approach with random antenna array offsets uniformly spaced within 12.5cm (PC3) in a single hemisphere. The antenna array offsets were compensated.\n\nTable 5.1.4.5-4: Statistical results of EIRP CFFNF offset simulations based on black&white-box approach with random antenna array offsets uniformly spaced within 10cm (PC1) in a single hemisphere. The antenna array offsets were compensated.\n\nIn this clause, results for near-field and far-field simulations of Ny x Nz antenna arrays for the CFFNF methodology are presented based on the black-box approach, i.e., the location active antenna panel for the FF beam peak direction is unknown while only the FF BP direction is known. The simulation assumptions are, for the most part, the same as those in Table 5.1.4.3-1.\nAll simulations are performed with an EM simulator, CST. The grid size used for the CST simulations had step sizes of 1o in  and . Given the previous observation regarding the need to offset the probe pattern, the simulations for CFFNF using black&white approach only focused on the feed probe pattern compensated.\nThe angular widths of the cone needed for the local searches as a function of the range length is tabulated in Table 5.1.4.6-1.\nTable 5.1.4.6-1: Local search cone angles for PC3 device with maximum offset of 12.5cm\n\nSince the black-box approach utilizes/requires relatively wide area local searches at r = r1, e.g., the width of the sector is about ±40o for r1=20cm, with limited local searches at r2 and r3 as illustrated in Figure 5.1.4.2-2, the test time for the black-box approach is inherently longer than the black&white-box approach due to the 3 vs 2 radii and the need for local searches vs no local search requirements. On the other hand, this approach does not require the declaration of the active antenna array location.\nSuitable approaches to reduce the test time of these local searches include coarse and fine search approaches, e.g., Figures M.2.2-3 and M.2.2-4 of [6]. Alternatively, continuous non-demodulated EIRP measurements on sectors with fixed angular distance could be utilized to speed up the local searches, as illustrated in Figure 5.1.4.6-1 for BP directions near the poles. For this accelerated search approach, the positioner is moved continuously while the measurements are performed in close succession.\n\nFigure 5.1.4.6-1 compares two approaches for estimating the Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) of a Fixed Flange Base (FF BP) antenna near a pole. The stepped search approach on the left shows a series of EIRP measurements taken at intervals, while the continuous search approach on the right presents a smoother curve with continuous measurements. This comparison highlights the benefits of the continuous search method, which provides a more accurate and continuous representation of the EIRP over time, aiding in the optimization of the antenna's performance.\nFigure 5.1.4.6-1: Stepped (left) vs continuous (right) search approach for EIRP for a FF BP near the pole.\nEven for arbitrary FF BP directions not near the pole, a continuous scan over the sector, can be performed since the beam is locked with the UBF towards the FF beam peak direction. An illustration of this approach is in Figure 5.1.4.6-2.\nFigure 5.1.4.6-2 illustrates the comparison between stepped and continuous search approaches for EIRP in an arbitrary fixed direction for frequency-flat (FF) beamforming (BP) scenarios. The stepped approach involves discrete steps in the search for the optimal EIRP, while the continuous approach allows for a smooth and continuous search. The figure demonstrates the trade-off between computational complexity and search accuracy, with the continuous approach generally offering a more accurate solution but at the cost of increased computational complexity. The figure highlights the importance of choosing the appropriate search approach based on the specific requirements and constraints of the system.\nFigure 5.1.4.6-2: Stepped (left) vs continuous (right) search approach for EIRP for an arbitrary FF BP direction.\nAs outlined in earlier, the CFFNF methodology based on the black-box approach leverages the declared FF beam peak direction and since the antenna array offset is not known/declared, a localized search for the NF beam peak in the NF must be performed over a small sector around the FF beam peak direction. For an approximately ±40o cone needed for PC3 devices (based on the 8x2 antenna array configuration) with a 20cm range length and a constant-step size measurement grid with ==1o, around 14k grid points for the initial NF local search at r=r1 would be required. Obviously, this is completely impractical due to the enormous test time requirements. The measurement uncertainties serving as the reference for investigations to follow, are shown in Table 5.1.4.6-2.\nTable 5.1.4.6-2: Statistical results of 500 EIRP CFFNF & CFFDNF CST simulations based on black-box approach with random 8x2 (12x12) antenna array offsets uniformly spaced within 12.5cm (10cm) in a single hemisphere. The antenna array offsets and probe pattern were compensated and the search grids were based on ==1o.\n\nThese CFFNF results are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.6-3 for 8x2 (PC3) and for 12x12 (PC1) and compared with the CFFDNF results (same as those in Table 5.1.4.4-8). These simulations assume that r2 is either r2=r1+1cm or r2=r1+2cm.\nTable 5.1.4.6-3: Statistical results of 500 EIRP CFFNF & CFFDNF CST simulations based on black-box, black&white-box approach with random 8x2 and 12x12 antenna array offsets uniformly spaced within 12.5cm for 8x2 and within 10cm for 12x12 in a single hemisphere. The antenna array offsets and probe pattern were compensated.\n\nFor the CFFNF (black box) simulations shown in Table 5.1.4.6-3, the local searches were performed using a 1o step size in  and  to establish the reference MUs for the CFFNF methodology.\nOn top of the initial local search at r=r1, small local searches at r=r2 and r=r3 are required as outlined in Section 5.1.4.2, i.e., the total number of grid points could exceed the numbers listed in Table 5.1.4.6-2. To significantly reduce the number of total number of grid points, coarse and fine searches were investigated more closely, i.e., an initial coarse search at r=r1 with r1,coarse and r1,coarse and fine searches around potential NF beam peak candidates with r123,finer123,fine are then performed at r=r1, r=r2, and r=r3. The MUs for the optimized search procedures are shown in Table 5.1.4.6-4; clearly, the presented optimized search grids significantly reduce the total number of search grid points while maintaining MUs similar to the reference MUs, Table 5.1.4.6-2.\nTable 5.1.4.6-4: Statistical results of 500 EIRP CFFNF & CFFDNF CST simulations based on black-box approach with random 8x2 (12x12) antenna array offsets uniformly spaced within 12.5cm (10cm) in a single hemisphere. The antenna array offsets and probe pattern were compensated and the search grids were optimized with coarse & fine local searches.\n\nConstant step size measurement grids can leverage continuous scans to speed up the searches while 5o searches yield between 200-500 grid points for a ~±40o cone at r1=20cm. Leveraging coarse and fine search approaches, e.g., a coarse search grid of 10o (between 40-110 grid points for a ~±40o cone) over the entire cone with localized fine 5o searches could likely significantly drop the number of grid points for the NF BP search. The total number could be further reduced when utilizing constant density search grids instead of constant-step size grids.\nA hybrid CFFNF approach could be used which combines the advantages in terms of test time of the black&white-box approach without the need of a vendor declaration, i.e., black box. Instead of having to declare the phase centre offset, this offset is determined first using the CFFNF methodology based on black-box approach. Here, the following sample approach could be leveraged:\n-\tFor low UL power test case #1\n-\tApply the black-box CFFNF test methodology using FF probe\n-\tUse the FF probe to steer the antenna beam towards the known BP direction\n-\tLock the beam using UBF\n-\tSwitch operation to NF probe\n-\tPerform local searches around sectors centred around the FF peak at three different radii in the NF\n-\tDetermine FF EIRP\n-\tDetermine phase centre offset of the active antenna\n-\tFor low UL power test cases ≥#2\n-\tApply the black&white-box NF test approach using NF probe\n-\tUse the FF probe to steer the antenna beam towards the known BP direction\n-\tLock the beam using UBF\n-\tSwitch operation to NF probe\n-\tPerform EIRP measurements at two different radii in the NF BP direction\n-\tDetermine EIRP\nThis clause provides simulation assumptions for how uncertainties of power measurements in the NF, p(di), affect the estimates for EIRP/EIS measurements based on the asymptotic expansion approach. As outlined in Figure 5.1.4-2, d is the distance between the NF measurement probe and the centre of the antenna array, while r is the range length defined as the distance between the centre of QZ and the NF measurement probe.\nThe asymptotic expansion approach expression for the normalized power as a function of d is assumed as follows\n\nand is illustrated for two cases, i.e., d1 & d2 maximized and minimized, in Figure 5.1.4.7-1. For the simulations in this clause, it is assumed that r2 = r1 + 2cm.\nFigure 5.1.4. 7 -1 illustrates the asymptotic expansion approach using two radii, with the antenna array positioned closer to the NF probe on the left than on the right. The figure depicts the signal propagation from the antenna array to the NF probe, showing how the signal's behavior changes as it travels through the medium. The two radii represent the distance between the antenna array and the NF probe, with the closer radius on the left and the farther one on the right. The figure highlights the importance of accurately modeling the signal propagation in such scenarios to ensure the performance of the communication system.\nFigure 5.1.4.7-1: Illustration of the asymptotic expansion approach using two radii approach with the antenna array located closer to the NF probe on the left than on the right.\nPower measurement uncertainties, ui, on the NF measurements p(di) can have an effect on the resulting estimate of the estimated FF EIRP/EIS due to the asymptotic expansion transformation. This effect is illustrated schematically in Figure 5.1.4.7-2.\nFigure 5.1.4. 7 -2 illustrates the impact of power measurement uncertainties ui on the estimation of the Fixed Frequency (FF) Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) and Effective Isotropic Sensitivity (EIS). The figure depicts the relationship between the true power p(di) and the estimated power p̂(di), with the uncertainties ui affecting the accuracy of the measurements. The figure highlights the importance of considering measurement errors in the estimation process, as they can lead to significant deviations in the estimated values. The visual representation emphasizes the need for robust error handling and accurate power measurements in the context of wireless communication systems.\nFigure 5.1.4.7-2: Illustration of the effect of power measurement uncertainties ui applied to NF measurements p(di) on the estimated FF EIRP/EIS.\nFor these simulations, ui is assumed to be a Gaussian distribution with std. deviation of  varying from 0 to 0.4dB. It should be noted that the test equipment uncertainties, e.g., Uncertainty of the RF power measurement equipment (B.2.1.6 of [7]) or gNB emulator uncertainty (B.2.1.17 of [7]), are not applicable in full here since the measurements at r1 and r2 are performed with the same equipment in close succession. Instead, the relative power measurement MU apply here.\nIn these simulations, it is furthermore assumed that N=30 averages are taken for each power measurement p(di).\nFor fixed offsets, the effect of ui with fixed standard deviations are shown in Table 5.1.4.7-1for the two extreme cases with dCFFNF,min=7.5cm and dCFFNF,max=20cm, visualized schematically in Figure 5.1.4.7-1. For each offset, 100K random Gaussian distributions for ui with fixed standard deviations (ranging from 0 to 0.4dB) were simulated to get obtain the mean errors with respect to the FF EIRP and the standard deviation.\nTable 5.1.4.7-1: Impact of power measurement uncertainty ui applied to p(d) measurements on FF EIRP for fixed offsets.\n\nIn order to obtain an overall estimate of the MUs, 1000 random offsets from Company A (500 random offsets from Company B) were evaluated. For each of the 1000 (500) random offsets, 100K random Gaussian distributions (100) for ui with fixed standard deviations were simulated to get obtain the mean errors and standard deviation for the FF EIRP; these results are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.7-2.\nTable 5.1.4.7-2: Impact of measurement uncertainty ui applied to p(d) measurements on FF EIRP with random offsets\n\nIn this clause, results for near-field and far-field simulations of Ny x Nz antenna arrays for the CFFdeltaNF methodology are presented based on the black-box approach, i.e., the location active antenna panel for the FF beam peak direction is unknown while only the FF BP direction is known. The simulation assumptions are, for the most part, the same as those in Table 5.1.4.3-1. All simulations are performed with various NF search step sizes in  and .\nIt has to be noted that the local search cone angles per range length shown in Table 5.1.4.6-1 are valid for CFFdeltaNF, same as the coarse and fine search approaches to reduce the test time.\nThe following analyses focus on NF and FF Matlab simulations based the following high-level test procedure\n-\tStep 1: Measure FF EIRP of the DUT in the FF beam peak direction for max UL power with the FF probe\n-\tStep 2: Perform a local search around the FF beam peak direction for max UL power with the NF probe without compensating the probe antenna pattern.\n-\tStep 3: Measure NF EIRP of the DUT in the NF beam peak direction (determine in Step 2) for max UL power with the NF probe\n-\tStep 4: Determine the correlation factor (difference between FF and NF EIRP measurements in Steps 1 and 3)\n-\tStep 5: Measure NF EIRP of the DUT in the NF beam peak direction for low UL power with the NF probe\n-\tStep 6: Estimate the FF EIRP for the low UL power case with the correlation factor determined in Step 4 and the NF EIRP measured in Step 5\nThese simulations assume that for the reference high-UL power operation measurements, a 4x1 and 8x2 PC3 antenna configuration of MxN is used in Steps 1 and 3. When the operation is switched to the low-UL power operation in Step 5, it is assumed that the DUT can switch to an OxP configuration with O≤M and P≤N. Additionally, it is assumed that any arbitrary sub-array can be activated, i.e., towards the edges, the centre, or anywhere in between the full array configuration. Examples for the 8x2 configuration and various OxP configurations for the low-UL power operation are illustrated in Figure 5.1.4.4-13. For the low-UL power operation, antenna arrays of O={1, 2, 4, 8} x P={1,2} for the 8x2 and O={1, 2, 4} x P={1} for the 4x2 configuration were simulated with all possible locations within the MxN array.\nThese simulations assumed 2000 random offsets and that the NF beam peak direction was determined without the NF probe antenna pattern compensation with 1o, 2.5o and 5o local search step sizes for the local search (see step 2 above). The simulation results for the PC3 DUT with 8x2 configuration for the high-UL power operation are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.8-1 and with 4x1 configuration for the high-UL power operation in Table 5.1.4.8-2. The simulation results for PC1 DUT with 12x12 configuration for the high-UL power operation are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.8-3.\n\nTable 5.1.4.8-1: CFFdeltaNF using black-box approach for 8x2 PC3 configuration. The low UL power configuration of the antenna array can be O={1, 2, 4, 8} x P={1,2} and be configured anywhere within the 8x2 array.\n\nTable 5.1.4.8-2: CFFdeltaNF using black-box approach for 4x1 PC3 configuration. The low UL power configuration of the antenna array can be O={1, 2, 4} x P={1} and be configured anywhere within the 4x1 array.\n\nTable 5.1.4.8-3: CFFdeltaNF using black-box approach for 12x12 PC1 configuration. The low UL power configuration of the antenna array can be O={1, 2, 4, 8} x P={1, 2} and be configured anywhere within the 12x12 array.\n\nModelling PA behaviour in polynomial mode is a common method for RF link simulation and well accepted by the industry [8][9]. Here, a simplified PA model is added into Matlab simulations to investigate how the PA behaviour will impact the beamforming pattern shape for high power vs low power.\n\nThe received signal expansion after beamforming based on the superposition approach outlined in detail in 5.1.4.1\n\nA PA model in polynomial can be expressed as follows [8][9]:\n\n-\t: equivalent complex baseband input signal sample for PA\n-\t: equivalent complex baseband output signal sample from PA\n-\t PA gain in linear\n-\t Parameter charactering PA non-linearity property determined by output P1dB and output IP2, IP3, etc.  contribute to the non-linearity components, without loss of generality:\nA simplified PA model  , which only contains one non-linearity item  is introduced into the received signal expression, the complex input signal for kth antenna array element  is turned to , then\n\n\nIn this simulation, we set the PA parameters, keep the low-UL power input signal power unchanged, but change the high-UL power input signal power to two different levels: the 2nd one is 2 dB higher than the 1st one. The simulations assume 200 random antenna array centre offsets and beam tilt for PC3 with 8x2 antenna configuration. The NF simulation test distance is 35cm, the low-UL power EIRP simulation error is plotted in Figure 5.1.4.8-1.\nWhen the operation is switched from high-UL power to low-UL power, the input signal power experiences a significant change, which means the PA is operated in two different regions. If both the high-UL power and low-UL power tests operate the PA in its perfect linearity region, the beam pattern shape change between high and low power is small and negligible under same antenna configuration as illustrated in Figure 5.1.4.8-1 (left plot), but if the high-UL power case working point is approaching the beginning of the nonlinearity region, for some beamforming tilt direction the beam pattern shape in the high-UL power case will have a large difference compared to the low-UL power case as illustrated in Figure 5.1.4.8-1 (right plot). This will then yield a relatively large error introduced by using the correlation factor deduced from the high-UL power case.\nFigure 5.1.4.8-1 presents a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the correlation factor, comparing different Power Amplifier (PA) model assumptions. The x-axis represents the correlation factor values, ranging from 0 to 1, while the y-axis denotes the corresponding probability. The four distinct curves correspond to four different PA model assumptions, A, B, C, and D, as indicated in the legend. The CDF curves show the probability of correlation factors falling within a given range, providing insights into the reliability and performance of the PA models under various conditions. The visual comparison of the curves helps in selecting the most appropriate PA model for the given scenario.Figure 5.1.4.8-1 presents a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the correlation factor, comparing different Power Amplifier (PA) model assumptions.

This phased antenna array has an 8x8 configuration and supports beam steering using external control of the code books. The FF measurements were performed at 84 cm while the NF measurements were performed at 20 cm. Three beam steering directions, i.e., -60o, 0o, and 60o were considered. Some parameters of the measurement procedures are summarized in Table 5.1.4.8-4.\nTable 5.1.4.8-4: Measurement Parameters of CFFdeltaNF methodology using black-box approach\n\nSince each individual antenna array element has independent amplitude and phase control, the high-UL power operation of the antenna array was implemented by maximizing the amplitude weights while those weights were reduced by 30 dB for the low-UL power operation.\nWith beam steering applied in a just a single direction, single principal cut measurements were performed to determine the NF direction (step 2 of the 6-step procedure introduced in the previous section); the NF probe antenna pattern was not compensated. The NF and FF EIRP patterns at 26 GHz are plotted in Figure 5.1.4.8-2 for the high-UL and low-UL power operations. It should be noted that the path loss (to the centre of QZ) was compensated in these plots already. Some pattern changes between the FF and NF patterns but also pattern changes between the high-UL and low-UL operation can be noticed.\nThe measurement results for the three different beam steering directions are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.8-5. The estimated FF EIRP for the low-UL case is compared with the measured EIRP to determine the error in the CFFdeltaNF EIRP MU. Clearly, the results show that the FF EIRP can be estimated well but the pattern changes due to low-UL vs high-UL power operation can introduce some MUs. More detailed analyses are required to study the pattern changes due to amplifiers and phase shifters operated at different power levels to determine the corresponding example MU.\nFigure 5.1.4.8-2 illustrates the measured Near-Field and Far-Field EIRP patterns of an 8x8 antenna array under both high-Ultra-Low-Power (UL) and low-Ultra-Low-Power (LLUL) operation. The Near-Field pattern shows the radiation pattern of the antenna array, while the Far-Field pattern depicts the radiation pattern in the far-field region. The figure demonstrates the antenna's ability to efficiently transmit and receive signals, with the Near-Field pattern showing a high radiation level in the direction of the antenna, and the Far-Field pattern showing a decrease in radiation level as the distance from the antenna increases. The figure is important for understanding the performance of the antenna array in different operating conditions and for optimizing the antenna's performance.\nFigure 5.1.4.8-2: Measured NF and FF EIRP patterns of the 8x8 antenna array with high-UL and low-UL power operation.\nTable 5.1.4.8-5: Measurement results for CFFdeltaNF methodology using black-box approach with no change in antenna array configuration of 8x8.\n\nWhile the errors in Table 5.1.4.8-5 are relatively small and could be interpreted as overall measurement MUs instead of being caused by the change in antenna pattern, the overall trend of the pattern plots and EIRP errors seem to support the earlier findings.\nAnother set of measurements was performed where the antenna configuration was modified between high-UL (MxN=8x8) and low-UL (OxP) operation similar as described in the previous section. Here, the OxP configuration was a subset of the 8x8 configuration with OxP={8x4, 8x2, and 8x1} configurations. For each of the OxP array configurations, different positions within the 8x8 array were activated. Sample 8x4 low-UL configurations and starting coordinates are visualized in Figure 5.1.4.8-3.\nFigure 5.1.4.8-3 illustrates a 8x8 configuration for high-UL power operation on the left and several 8x4 configurations for low UL-power operation on the right. The figure demonstrates the various configurations used in a telecommunication system to optimize power consumption and performance. The 8x8 configuration utilizes more antennas, resulting in higher throughput and better signal quality, but also consumes more power. On the other hand, the 8x4 configuration uses fewer antennas, which reduces power consumption but may lead to lower throughput and signal quality. The figure highlights the trade-offs between power consumption and performance that engineers must consider when designing telecommunication systems.\nFigure 5.1.4.8-3: 8x8 Configuration for high-UL power operation (left) and sample 8x4 configurations for low UL-power operation.\nThe measurement results for the set of measurements at two different NF range lengths of 20cm and 35cm with changes in the antenna array configuration are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.8-6. These results yield similar findings as presented earlier:\n-\tWhen the antenna configuration for the low UL power operation is a subset of the antenna configuration for the high UL power operation, the CFFdeltaNF methodology needs to take EIRP MU uncertainties into account\n-\tThese uncertainties increase with decreasing range lengths\nTable 5.1.4.8-6: Measurement results for CFFdeltaNF methodology using black-box approach with changes in antenna array configuration from 8x8 (high-UL power) to OxP (low-UL power).\n\nThe next part focuses on simulations based on the CFFdeltaNF methodology using black-box approach, specifically the correlation factor approach where the low-UL power operation is no longer triggered. Instead, the low-UL power measurement is the result of performing measurements at frequencies that yield low EIRPs when compared to the EIRPs at the reference frequency, e.g., ACLR. Therefore, the test procedure for this approach is as follows with the first 4 steps identical and slightly adjusted steps 5 and 6 to the approach introduced earlier:\n-\tStep 1: Measure FF EIRP of the DUT in the FF beam peak direction for high-UL power with the FF probe at the reference frequency\n-\tStep 2: Perform a local search around the FF beam peak direction for high-UL power with the NF probe without compensating the probe antenna pattern at the reference frequency.\n-\tStep 3: Measure NF EIRP of the DUT in the NF beam peak direction (determined in Step 2) for high-UL power with the NF probe at the reference frequency\n-\tStep 4: Determine the correlation factor (difference between FF and NF EIRP measurements in Steps 1 and 3) and add the pathloss differences at the desired frequency\n-\tStep 5: Measure NF EIRP of the DUT in the NF beam peak direction with the NF probe at the desired frequency other than the reference frequency\n-\tStep 6: Estimate the FF EIRP for the desired frequency with the correlation factor determined in Step 4 and the NF EIRP measured in Step 5\n\nThe simplified PA model  described in the previous section is used in this simulation. The 1st item  is the major component for in-band (wanted) signal, while some of the 2nd item  will also contribute to the in-band pattern; the OOB signal’s pattern shape will be impacted by the non-linearity component  [8][9].\nWhen  is defined in amplitude and phase expression as , we assume the amplitude is constant and only adjust the phase for each channel, then the 2nd item can be expressed as\nIf   is not always zeros for all indices  ,  will not generate the same pattern shape as  because of the different phase offset among multiple channels.\nBelow Figures 5.1.4.8-4 and 5.1.4.8-5 use the 8x2 antenna array with random position offset and beam tilt as an example to show the PA’s non-linearity impact on the OOB signal pattern shape.\nFor Figure 5.1.4.8-4, when the PA has poor linearity, the OOB signal pattern shape (plot on right) is different from the in-band signal pattern (plot on left). In this case, when using the relative correlation factor approach and the local NF peak direction deduced from the in-band signal to estimate OOB EIRP, the error can be as large as -3.67 dB.\nFor Figures 5.1.4.8-4, when the PA has very good linearity, the OOB signal pattern shape (plot on right) is almost same as the in-band signal pattern (plot on left). In this case, the error is insignificant.\nThese analyses show the out-of-band signal’s pattern shape will be impacted by the PA behaviour; the relative correlation factor deduced from the in-band signal to estimate out of band signal’s FF power will introduce extra errors. Clearly, the corresponding EIRP MUs are dependent on the PA and needs further study.\nFigure 5.1.4.8-4 illustrates a power amplifier (PA) with poor linearity, showcasing the in-band pattern on the left and the out-of-band pattern on the right. The in-band pattern demonstrates the main signal's distribution, while the OOB pattern reveals the side-bands that can cause interference. This figure is crucial for understanding the impact of non-linear behavior in power amplifiers on overall system performance.\nFigure 5.1.4.8-4: PA with poor linearity. In-band pattern on the left, OOB pattern on the right.\nFigure 5.1.4.8-5 illustrates a power amplifier (PA) with excellent linearity, showcasing the in-band pattern on the left and the out-of-band pattern on the right. The in-band pattern demonstrates the PA's ability to transmit signals within the designated frequency range without distortion, while the OOB pattern highlights the suppression of unwanted signals outside the specified frequency band. This figure is crucial for understanding the performance and efficiency of power amplifiers in wireless communication systems.\nFigure 5.1.4.8-5: PA with good linearity. In-band pattern on the left, OOB pattern on the right.\nThe next investigation focuses on measurements and the 6-step procedure discussed earlier. The measurements presented in Table 5.1.4.8-7 use the same 8x8 antenna array introduced earlier. Here, a 200 MHz wide signal is applied to the RF ports of the phased antenna array and the power in the reference channel around 26 GHz as well as the adjacent channels (Low, High) were measured in both the NF at {20cm, 35cm} range lengths and FF at 84cm range length in the respective in-band beam peak directions.\nTable 5.1.4.8-7: Measurement results for CFFdeltaNF methodology using black-box approach.\n\nThese results show that the relative correlation factor approach of CFFdeltaNF is generally applicable for measurements at frequencies other than the reference frequency. However, as outlined earlier, MUs should be considered for this approach to take into account pattern changes due to non-ideal PA behaviour which was verified using measurements. More detailed analyses are required to study the non-linearity effects of PAs on the corresponding EIRP MU of CFFdeltaNF.\nAnother investigation focused on the effect of the UE pattern change over frequency in the resulting EIRP using the CFFdeltaNF methodology with black-box approach as described in clause 5.1.4.2. A simulation campaign using Matlab was defined following the assumptions presented in Table 5.1.4.3-1 with additional frequencies at 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1200MHz from the centre frequency (i.e. 28GHz).\nIn this case, the EIRP error is calculated between the theoretical EIRP value in FF at the test frequency (e.g. 400MHz from channel’s centre frequency) and the resulting EIRP value calculated in the FF at the same test frequency but applying the  calculated for the reference test case at the reference frequency.\nMean and standard deviation errors, for all offsets and test frequencies, are presented in table 5.1.4.8-8, including results for different grid steps for the local search:\nTable 5.1.4.8-8: Statistical results of EIRP simulations for CFFdeltaNF with black-box approach\n\nThese results, assuming no change in antenna patterns due to non-linearities of the PAs, etc., confirm that CFFdeltaNF method is not impacted the potential changes in the pattern of the UE array due to frequency response.\nThis clause provides influence of noise simulation assumptions and results for IFF/DFF, CFFDNF, and CFFNF methodologies.\nThe influence of noise quantifies the effect of a SNR at the TE input on EIRP measurements as outlined in [7].\n\nFor low UL power test cases, the ~1m path losses due to range length (DFF) or focal distance (IFF) yield very poor SNR conditions at the TE input. Assuming a fixed noise level at the TE input, a reduction in measurement distance/range loss will significantly improve the SNR conditions for CFFDNF and CFFNF when compared to DFF/IFF as illustrated in Figure 5.1.4.9-1.\nFigure 5.1.4. 9 -1 presents the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions for various testing methodologies in a telecommunication system. The figure illustrates the relationship between SNR and the test methodology, with different curves representing different test conditions. The key visual elements include the SNR values on the y-axis and the test methodologies on the x-axis, with curves indicating the performance of the system under each test condition. The figure highlights the importance of selecting the appropriate test methodology to achieve the desired SNR for successful communication.\nFigure 5.1.4.9-1: SNR Conditions for different test methodologies\n\nThe analyses in this clause are focused on the following PC3 assumption:\n-\tFor an r1=20cm CFFNF range length (distance between probe and centre of QZ), the min distance between the probe and the antenna array is dCFFNF,min= r1-12.5cm (max offset)=7.5cm\n-\tFor an r1=20cm CFFNF range length, the max distance between the probe and the antenna array is dCFFNF,max=r1=20cm\n-\tSimilarly, for the CFFDNF methodology with a range length of rCFFDNF=35cm, the min (max) distance between the probe and the antenna array is dCFFDNF,min = rCFFDNF-12.5cm=22.5cm (dCFFDNF,max = rCFFDNF=35cm).\n-\tFor the DFF/IFF calculations, we considered a rDFF/IFF=1m range length for simplicity.\nThe improvements in SNR for CFFNF and CFFDNF compared to DFF/IFF are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.9-1.\nTable 5.1.4.9-1: SNR Improvement due to reduced measurement distance w.r.t. 1m DFF/IFF FSPL with fixed noise at TE Input\n\nIn our influence of noise calculations, we assumed a range of SNR values for the DFF/IFF methodology at the TE input and scaled the effective SNR at the TE input for the CFFDNF/CFFNF analyses as shown in Table 5.1.4.9-2 based on the FSPL/SNR improvements in Table 5.1.4.9-1.\nTable 5.1.4.9-2: Effective SNRs at the TE Input based on assumed SNR at the TE input for DFF/IFF\n\nThe analyses of the difference in EIRP when compared to the FF EIRP due to noise were based on 10k different AWGN simulations and N=30 averages were taken for each EIRP analysed. In each of the 10k AWGN simulations, a signal is generated first with 1000 samples, subsequently AWGN with specified SNR on the signal is applied, and in the end power of signal + AWGN was measured. These simulated results, labelled ‘|Mean Err to FF Reference|’ in the following tables are then compared with the calculations using the analytical  equation and labelled ‘Influence of Noise’ in the following tables: for rDFF/IFF, dCFFDNF,min, and dCFFNF,min in Table 5.1.4.9-3 and for rDFF/IFF, dCFFDNF,max, and dCFFNF,max in Table 5.1.4.9-4. In these simulations, it was assumed that r2 = r1 + 2cm.\nTable 5.1.4.9-3: Influence of Noise Simulations and Calculations for DFF/IFF, CFFDNF, CFFNF based on shortest measurement distance dmin\n\nTable 5.1.4.9-4: Influence of Noise Simulations and Calculations for DFF/IFF, CFFDNF, CFFNF based on largest measurement distance dmax\n\nThe simulated influence of noise, i.e., |Mean Err to FF Reference|, was determined for non-fixed distances d. Here, 1000 random offsets uniformly spaced from 0 to 12.5cm were simulated and the individual results were averaged to obtain the results tabulated in Table 5.1.4.9-5 for PC3 devices. The simulated influences of noise are within the results at the respective extremes presented in Table 5.1.4.9-3 (min offset) and Table 5.1.4.9-4 (max offset). Similar simulations were performed for PC1 devices with the 12x12 antenna configuration with maximum offset of 10cm and are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.9-6.\nTable 5.1.4.9-5: Influence of Noise Simulations and Calculations for DFF/IFF, CFFDNF, CFFNF based on 1000 random offsets uniformly spaced within 12.5cm (PC3) in a single hemisphere and N=1.\n\nTable 5.1.4.9-6: Influence of Noise Simulations and Calculations for DFF/IFF, CFFDNF, CFFNF based on 1000 random offsets uniformly spaced within 10cm (PC1) in a single hemisphere and N=1.\n\nWhile these results compare the simulated Influence of Noise, i.e., Mean Err to FF Reference, for the different methodologies at fixed DFF/IFF SNRs based on a 1m free-space path loss, it should be pointed out that for the same SNR at rCFFDNF, the CFFDNF Influence of Noise is lower than the CFFNF Influence of Noise for the same SNR at r2,CFFNF < rCFFDNF.\nThe analyses in this clause are to determine the uncertainties on EIRP/EIS when the antenna offset is declared incorrectly, i.e., when the actual antenna offset deviates from the declared antenna offset. These analyses are based on differences in path losses between the declared and the actual offsets and the difference in compensated probe gains. Here, the following assumptions were made:\n-\t1000 random offsets (xoffset, yoffset, zoffset), illustrated with red dots in Figure 5.1.4.10-1, were simulated and each offset was considered the actual offset of the antenna array.\n-\tFor each random offset, 1000 random declaration errors (xerror, yerror, zerror), illustrated with blue dots in Figure 5.1.4.10-1, were generated with a fixed radius from the actual offset\n-\tFor each actual offset and for each of the declared offsets, the device orientation was calculated so that the NF probe is placed in the actual/declared NF beam peak direction\n-\tFor each actual offset and for each of the declared offsets, the corresponding path losses between the (actual/declared) antenna offsets and the probe were determined\n-\tFor each actual offset and for each of the declared offsets, the corresponding probe antenna gains were determined in the respective NF beam peak directions.\n\nFigure 5.1.4. 10 -1 presents an illustration of simulation assumptions, specifically focusing on the consideration of 1000 random offsets and 1000 random errors around each offset. The figure aims to depict the actual antenna offsets on the left side, while the right side illustrates the errors that may occur around these offsets. This information is crucial for understanding the potential variations and inaccuracies that can impact the simulation results, highlighting the importance of considering these factors in the modeling process.Figure 5.1.4. 10 -1 presents an illustration of simulation assumptions, focusing on the consideration of 1000 random offsets and 1000 random errors around each offset.

The mismatch between the TE and UE may lead such UEs to disable a Tx chain associated with one DL polarization and may result in an EIRP measurement which fails to include the polarization gain at some test points;\n-\tUL polarization basis mismatch for demodulation. Some UE implementations may support uplink transmission diversity schemes which, although transparent to the specification, impact the demodulation performance when the UL signal is demodulated on just a single polarization.\nTherefore, these two issues are addressed separated with different approach. The potential solutions to minimize the impact of polarization basis mismatch address two distinct goals:  to enhance the EIRP measurement of UEs with various capabilities, and to enhance the test equipment demodulation performance in the uplink, such that a test mode to disable Tx diversity at the UE is no longer necessary for the UE to perform conformance testing.\n",

                            "text_content": "As an enhancement to the FR2 test equipment topology, it has been proposed to adopt a zero-forcing MIMO receiver architecture so that dual-polarization transmissions by the UE can be demodulated by the test equipment receiver.\nTwo methods of demodulation and EVM calculation were discussed, one utilized DMRS-based channel inversion (Method 1), and the other based on inversion of the LSE-estimate of the channel (Method 2).\nThe EVM calculation method for 2-layer measurements is shown in Figure 5.2.3.1.1.1-1 and for 1-layer measurements in Figure 5.2.3.1.1.1-2.\nFigure 5 illustrates the block diagram for calculating the Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) in a 2-Layer Universal Link (UL) Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system. The diagram showcases the various components involved in the EVM calculation, including the transmit and receive antennas, the baseband processing unit, and the digital signal processing (DSP) blocks. The EVM is a measure of the distortion in the transmitted signal, and its minimization is crucial for maintaining signal quality in wireless communication systems. The figure highlights the importance of accurate signal processing and modulation techniques in achieving low EVM values, which are essential for reliable communication in 2-Layer UL MIMO systems.\nFigure 5.2.3.1.1.1-1: EVM calculation block diagram for 2-Layer UL MIMO\nFigure 5 illustrates the block diagram for calculating the Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) in a 1-Layer network. The figure depicts the input signal, which undergoes various transformations such as filtering, amplification, and equalization before reaching the output. Key components include the transmitter, receiver, and intermediate nodes, which are responsible for signal processing and error correction. The EVM calculation block is highlighted, emphasizing the importance of accurately measuring the error in the transmitted signal to ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 5.2.3.1.1.1-2: EVM calculation block diagram for 1-Layer\nThe TE receives signals from 2 different ports which are connected to the dual polarized measurement antenna in the FR2 test system.\nFor the 2-layer transmission case shown in Figure 5.2.3.1.1.1-1 a MIMO equalization step as described in section 5.2.3.1.1.2 is performed to separate the layers.\nFor the 1-layer transmission case shown in Figure 5.2.3.1.1.1-2 the signals from both measurement antenna polarizations are combined using maximum ratio combining as described in section 5.2.3.1.1.3.\nEach layer is then processed as described in section 5.2.3.1.1.4 to receive the measurement results for each individual layer.\nThe MIMO equalization is based only on reference signals (DMRS) without using any data symbols. In order to obtain comparable EVM results independent of the number of DMRS symbols per slot, only the first DMRS symbol in each slot is used.\nEstimation of effective 2x2 channel matrix is a well known procedure if reference signals use different subcarriers, e.g. in case of DMRS antenna ports 0 and 2. In case that same subcarriers are used, e.g. DMRS antenna ports 0 and 1, a channel decomposition is necessary taking advantage of the orthogonal codes wf and wt and assuming identical channel coefficients for adjacent subcarriers of same CDM group.\nEffective channel including the precoding matrix P is:\n\nwith\n\nwhere y denotes the received symbol on port index n and r the reference signal for layer index ν.\nSince reference signals of a specific layer are transmitted only on subcarriers of one CDM group channel, interpolation is needed in order to obtain channel coefficients for all subcarriers. Channel interpolation is done using the channel coefficients of active CDM group in all other CDM groups.\nThe channel coefficients used to calculate the equalizer coefficients are obtained after channel smoothing in frequency domain by computing the moving average of interpolated channel coefficients. The moving average window size is 7. For subcarriers at or near the edge of allocation the window size is reduced accordingly.\nThe ZF equalizer coefficients are calculated as the inverse of the effective channel matrix, in general:\n\nThe channel estimation for maximum ratio combining is based only on reference signals (DMRS) w/o including any data symbols. One or all DMRS symbols of one slot can be considered, but in order to obtain comparable EVM results independent of number of DMRS symbols per slot, only first DMRS symbol is used.\nEstimation of effective 2x1 channel is a well known procedure. In case of transmit diversity, the effective channel includes the precoding matrix P:\n\nwith\n\nwhere y denotes the received symbol on port index n and r the reference signal.\nSince reference signals are transmitted only on subcarriers of one CDM group, channel interpolation is needed in order to obtain channel coefficients for all subcarriers. Channel interpolation is done using the channel coefficients of active CDM group in all other CDM groups.\nThe channel coefficients used to calculate the equalizer coefficients are obtained after channel smoothing in frequency domain by computing the moving average of interpolated channel coefficients. The moving average window size is 7. For subcarriers at or near the edge of allocation the window size is reduced accordingly.\nThe ZF equalizer coefficients for maximum ratio combining are calculated as pseudo inverse of effective channel, in general:\n\nAfter performing either the MIMO equalization as described in section 5.2.3.1.1.2 or the maximum ratio combining as described in section 5.2.3.1.1.3, each layer is processed using the existing procedure as defined in Annex E of TS 38.521-1 [6].\nSince the channel estimation is calculated only on first DMRS symbol an averaging including all 14 symbols of one slot, i.e. data and reference signals, is needed in order to minimize EVM. The averaging is achieved by the LS equalization method described for single layer in Annex E.3. of TS 38.521-2 [6].\nMS(f,t) and NS(f,t) are processed with a least square (LS) estimator, to derive one equalizer coefficient per time slot and per allocated subcarrier. EC(f) is defined for each layer as:\n\nWith * denoting complex conjugation. EC(f) are used to equalize layer data symbols.\nEVM equalizer spectral flatness is derived from equalizer coefficients for each layer as follows:\n\nThe block diagram of this demodulation scheme for FR2 2L UL is shown in figure 5.2.3.1.2.1-1. Everything to the right of the FFT blocks is per SC, and therefore must be replicated for the entire UL allocation. Figure 5.2.3.1.2.1-2 shows the 2L demodulation calculator while suppressing sections that would be unused for single layer operation.\nFor the 2-layer transmission case shown in Figure 5.2.3.1.2.1-1 a MIMO equalization step as described in section 5.2.3.1.2.2 is performed to separate the layers.\nFor the 1-layer transmission case shown in Figure 5.3.2.1.2.1-2 the signals from both measurement antenna polarizations are combined using maximum ratio combining as described in section 5.2.3.1.2.3.\nFigure 5.2.3.1.2.1-1 illustrates a demodulation scheme for FR2 2L UL, focusing on the uplink (UL) of a frequency range designated for 2-bit phase-shift keying (PSK). The figure showcases the process of signal demodulation, starting with the transmission of modulated signals from the user equipment (UE) to the base station (gNB). The gNB then processes the signals using a digital down converter (DDC) and a low-noise amplifier (LNA), which are essential components for signal amplification and noise reduction.\n\nThe demodulation process involves the gNB's receiver, which decodes the received signals using a digital predistorter (DPS) and a phase-locked loop (PLL). The DPS is responsible for correcting the phase of the received signals, while the PLL ensures synchronization between the transmitted and received signals. The demodulated signals are then passed through a digital up converter (DUC) and a power amplifier (PA), which are crucial for signal amplification and transmission.\n\nThe figure also highlights the importance of synchronization in the demodulation process, as it ensures that the received signals are accurately decoded and processed. The synchronization\nFigure 5.2.3.1.2.1-1: Demodulation scheme for FR2 2L UL\nFigure 5.2.3.1.2.1-2 illustrates a demodulation scheme for uplink (UL) transmission in a two-layer network, specifically designed for single layer UL. The figure depicts the process of signal demodulation at the base station (gNB) and the user equipment (UE). The key components include the gNB, UE, and the demodulation process. The figure highlights the importance of efficient demodulation in ensuring reliable communication between the gNB and the UE.\nFigure 5.2.3.1.2.1-2: Demodulation scheme for 2L UL, used for single layer UL\nFor the 2L UL MIMO EVM test case, the system is framed as:\n\nHere, H is the 2x2 OTA channel, G is the 2x2 diversity scheme that the UE uses, and W is the 2x2 precoder matrix. G and W are UE-resident as shown in Figure 5.2.3.1.2.2-1.\nFigure 5.2.3.1.2.2-1 presents a detailed model of a user equipment (UE) implementation, illustrating the various components and their interactions within a telecommunication system. The figure showcases the physical and logical layers, emphasizing the role of the UE in communication processes. Key elements include the radio access network (RAN), core network (CN), and the UE itself, which is responsible for data transmission and reception. The figure also highlights the importance of synchronization and timing protocols, ensuring seamless communication between devices. Overall, this model provides a comprehensive view of the UE's role in telecommunication systems, emphasizing the complexity and interdependence of various components.\nFigure 5.2.3.1.2.2-1: UE implementation model\nHere, the effective channel (HGW) as seen by the TE can be represented by a 2x2 matrix for each subcarrier (‘SC’). The process of equalization is implemented by multiplying data collected simultaneously at the TE receiver ports ‘y’ by an equalization matrix ‘A’. A unique ‘A’ matrix is computed for each SC. Using the ZF equalization method, ‘A’ is generated as the inverse of the estimate ‘F’ of the effective channel HGW for that SC.\n\n; where\nFor each SC, the train of reconstructed symbols and received symbols are jointly used to estimate F (effective channel, also per SC), by minimizing the LSE between the received symbols and those that are calculated from the estimated channel and the reconstructed symbols, over all the symbols in the measurement interval. This technique is a 2L generalization of the legacy method to estimate the legacy rank 1 channel. This LSE minimization procedure results in the following channel estimate:\n\nWhere xk and yk are respectively the kth transmitted and received OFDM symbol in the measurement interval:\n\nNote the strong resemblance to the expression for channel estimate for the single layer legacy demodulation case.\nWhile A can be taken as the inverse of ‘F’ for the ZF equalizer, we show later that there is a more general form of A that helps streamline single layer and 2L treatments. Two aspects bear further consideration: the existence of F and the invertibility of ‘F’, see section 5.2.3.1.2.5. The detailed treatment logically derives that if either F or F-1 do not exist, it is because the UE cannot support an OTA channel (coded into matrix ‘H’) of rank2, and is unable to maintain valid 2L UL. Failure to calculate either of the quantities therefore is tied to poor UE implementation rather than TE limitation.\nNoting that A is the inverse of the estimate of the product HGW, the equalization step can be written as:\n\nThe matrix equation can be resolved into 2 separate scalar equations corresponding to the two layers:\n\n\nWhere, x̂m represents equalized layer data ‘m’, xm represents reconstructed (ideal) layer ‘m’ data, and vm represents noise accompanying ideal layer data ‘m’ after equalization. Note that the transmitted symbols are recovered without phase or gain modification, albeit in the presence of accompanying noise (responsible for EVM degradation). This is the case for every allocated SC – when the symbol on each sub carrier on each layer is reproduced without gain modification as this method does, no flatness artefacts are introduced into the measurements.\nThe channel estimate remains of the same form as in the 2L case, but the dimensions are now 2x1 because x is now a scalar for the single layer case:\n\nBecause x is a scalar, (xxH)-1 is merely the reciprocal of a scalar quantity. Consequently, there are no numerical corner cases pertaining to existence of the quantity to ponder.\nDue to F not being square, the equalization matrix ‘A’ must be derived as the pseudo inverse of F, rather than a true inverse as in the 2L case:\n\nThis type of ZF equalizer implements MRC for the single layer case. Note that this expression simplifies to A=F-1 for the 2L case, and so, ‘ASL’ is a more general construction for ‘A’ that is applicable to both cases (single layer as well as 2L).\nIn the legacy single layer UL case, the channel estimate for each SC was a (complex) scalar, so it was straightforward to evaluate equalizer flatness. In the 2L test case however, the channel equalizer ‘A’ consists of 4 elements, 2 for each layer. Framing A as a row vector:\n\nFor layer ‘m’, recall that the ZF equalization coefficients for each layer AmT are scaled to diagonalize the channel. There is no realistic bound on the relative ratios of the coefficients, but the coefficients together preserve any frequency domain shape of the channel. Therefore, a composite parameter cm for each layer ‘m’ can be used to evaluate the equalizer spectrum flatness, given by:\n\nOr\n\nThe FR2 single layer case is merely a subset of the 2L case, where ‘m’ can take on just one value:  1.\nRecall that F, the estimate of the effective channel for each sub carrier is derived as an averaging operation over multiple OFDM symbols:\n\nThe existence of F depends on the sum matrix xxH being rank 2. Recall now that ‘xk’ is the train of constellation symbols per SC, for both layers, as embedded in the train of OFDM symbols. For pseudo-random data, the sum matrix xxH accumulates positive values along the diagonal, and random zero-mean values in off diagonal locations (cross correlation across independent data). As the number of OFDM symbols increases in the averaging interval, this matrix tends towards a multiple of an identity matrix. Could this matrix be rank 1 in some corner case? Mathematically, this can happen only if ‘x’ is the same (both layers) in a SC for all OFDM symbols in the averaging interval. This outcome is extremely improbable if not impossible due to reliance on scramblers and standardized pseudo-random data generators in the UE. One can therefore conclude that F exists if the TE can merely work out ‘xk’. Since the TE estimates ‘xk’ by decoding measured data (see figure 2.2.1-1), the TE still depends on the UE’s ability to transmit data with enough inter-layer isolation to allow reconstruction. If F does not exist or is ill conditioned, it must mean that the UE is unable to maintain valid 2L UL.\nThe invertibility of ‘F’ depends on the invertibility of the cross-correlation term yxH in the expression for ‘F’:\n\nThe first term inside the parenthesis (GWxxH) involves 2 unitary matrices multiplied by a strongly diagonal matrix (as discussed in the section about the existence of F), and so remains rank 2. The second term inside the parenthesis (nxH) is a measure of correlation between noise and data symbols.\n‘Noise’ can be truly thermal (low output power cases) in which case the second term would tend towards an all-zero matrix and can be ignored. We can therefore conclude that in low output power cases, yxH is rank 2 (i.e it is invertible) if H is also rank 2. Now, H contains information about the UE antenna’s cross-pol isolation: H is strongly rank 2 for UE implementations with good cross-pol isolation. H loses rank or becomes ill-conditioned if the UE’s transmit chains suffer from high antenna correlation. If F is not invertible or is ill conditioned, the reason can be traced back to the UE’s inability to maintain valid 2L UL.\nAlternatively, the ‘noise’ can be composed of third order non-linearity from a PA. This is the case for high output power cases. A PA can be approximated by the time domain normalized characteristic shown here (k3 > 0):\n\nThe cubic term retains strong correlation with the linear term, so the PA model’s cubic term output can be approximated as sum of a correlated component (‘a.x’, where ‘a’ is related to the correlation coefficient of the cubic term to the linear term) and an un-correlated component (‘nun’). In the post-FFT frequency domain, yxH can be rewritten as:\n\nWe focus on the matrix inside the parenthesis:\n\nThe third term inside the parenthesis is a measure of correlation between data and the un-correlated component, which (by definition) would tend towards an all-zero matrix and can be ignored, like the low output power case. There is still risk of yxH losing rank and becoming non-invertible, however, for example if the matrix (GW-a.k3.I) loses rank.\nNote that this mechanism (3rd order nonlinearity) also exists in the case of demodulation by TE with single chain receivers, and experience tells us that PA non-linearity products do not contribute to a situation where the channel cannot be inverted. Legacy demodulation procedures therefore serve as empirical proof of the argument that the matrix (G.W-a.k3.I) never loses rank.\nPhysically, for compliant UEs, | k3| is in the range of 0.10-0.20 in normalized form, and a, while PAPR dependent, can be verified to be <= 2 for NR UL waveforms. We also note that matrices G and W are unitary, which allows direct comparison of the terms in (GW-a.k3.I);  the relative magnitude of | a.k3| is small enough that matrix B would still be dominated by the first term (GW xxH) for the range of EVMs expected to be measured. We therefore expect B is rank 2 for pseudo random data. Consequently, here too, rank of yxH depends solely on rank of H. i.e yxH is rank 2 (i.e it is invertible) if H is also rank 2. If F is still not invertible (i.e yxH is rank 1), it is because the UE cannot support an OTA channel (H) of rank2, and is unable to maintain valid 2L UL.\nThis treatment can conclude with the observation that both F and F-1 exist provided the UE can support a rank 2 OTA channel, i.e rank(H)=2.\nEVM calculation is gated by the TE’s procedure to cancel LO. Per existing signaling, only one LO location can be declared per BWP for the carrier being tested, be it single layer or two.  More significantly, the only locations allowed to be declared are SC locations. For NR, LO cancellation based on signaling declaration of LO location can therefore be performed either pre- or post-FFT. Per layer quantities are only available in the post-FFT, post-equalization domain where the channel has already been diagonalized, so the focus in the treatment below is the post-FFT method.\nA UE can expect LO cancellation only if the LO location is signalled in terms of a valid subcarrier location. If the UE reports 3300 or 3301 via IE txDirectCurrentLocation the TE or network can get no information on LO location other than ‘it does not coincide with the FFT grid’. This aspect is consistent with the exception in the core-requirement pertaining to this IE.\nThe following passage describes a method based on post-FFT LO removal based on LO location declaration via IE txDirectCurrentLocation. Post-FFT LO removal involves removing dependency on the LO-bearing SC or being able to ignore the impact of LO leakage.\nRecall that each allocated SC has an instantiation of the post-FFT procedure outlined in figure 2.2.1-2. The equalization matrix ‘A’ is calculated for each sub carrier and is derived from reconstructed symbols recovered from processing DMRS. In NR, DMRS symbols do not occupy each SC of the OFDM symbol, necessitating some form of interpolation for DMRS-less sub carriers. To minimize impact of LO leakage on the accuracy of the process of reconstructing the transmitted symbols, a logical choice is to select a DMRS comb that skips over the SC declared to have the LO leakage.\nWhile it is relatively easy to ensure that the reconstruction process remains free of impact from LO leakage by using the comb, the measured symbols ‘y’ for the LO-bearing SC still contain a systematic and constant leakage term for all OFDM symbols in the measurement interval.\n; where\nwhere c1 and c2 are complex constants pertaining to the LO leakage. The channel estimate for the LO-bearing SC starts with the LSE estimate:\n\n\nThere are multiple options to deal with this extra term from LO leakage (C(xH(xxH)-1). The first option is to use a very long-term averaging to determine ‘F’ for the LO-bearing SC. Since ‘C’ is a constant and (xH) can reasonably be assumed to be zero for a long enough average, the contribution of the first term reduces to zero. So, the first option is to do nothing other than ensure a very long-term average is used for calculating ‘F’ for the LO bearing SC. The second option is to interpolate from neighbour SCs to determine F for the LO-bearing SC. Other, more sophisticated treatments may also exist. ‘F’ calculated from either of these methods can be compared to ‘F’ calculated using the LSE-estimate expression over the standard measurement interval to derive the value of ‘C’ for the measured interval.\nThe equalization equation for an LO-bearing SC is:\nFigure 5.2.3.1.2.6-1 illustrates the equalization equation for an LO-bearing SC, which is a crucial component in telecommunication systems. The figure shows the relationship between the input and output signals, demonstrating how the system compensates for channel impairments to ensure reliable communication. The equation is represented in a matrix form, highlighting the complex interactions between the various signal components. This information is essential for understanding the performance of LO-bearing SCs in various telecommunication scenarios.\nFigure 5.2.3.1.2.6-1: Equalization equation for an LO-bearing SC\nThe calculated quantity ‘AC’ can be used both to estimate carrier leakage per layer, as well as to correct the estimated symbol on the LO-bearing SC prior to EVM calculation.\nTo downselect one of the Methods described above, the EVM measurement performance for both methods has been analysed with the following assumptions:\n-\tTest waveforms constructed with:\n-\tFlat signal PSD\n-\tInjected AWGN\n-\tSignal configuration:\n-\t[50/66] contiguous RBs\n-\tCP-OFDM (QPSK – 64QAM – 256QAM) PUSCH, rank 2\n-\tUL RMC as defined in appendix of 38.101-2\nIn the following, the results of the analysis of Method 1 and 2 are presented and compared.\nAs a first step the EVM accuracy for both methods has been analysed. As can be seen from Figure 5.2.3.1.3.1-1, both Methods show good EVM measurement accuracy, while Method 1 has equivalent or superior accuracy to Method 2.\nFigure 5.2.3.1.3 -1 presents an evaluation of EVM (Error Vector Magnitude) accuracy for slot length signals using two distinct methods, labeled as Method 1 and Method 2. The figure illustrates the comparison of EVM values across various slot lengths, providing insights into the performance of each method. The x-axis represents the slot length, while the y-axis quantifies the EVM. The two lines in the graph correspond to the results obtained from Method 1 and Method 2, respectively. The visual representation allows for a quick assessment of the relative performance of the two methods in terms of EVM accuracy.\nFigure 5.2.3.1.3.1-1: EVM accuracy evaluation for slot length signals with Method 1 & 2\nFigure 5.2.3.1.3.1-2 shows further analysis of Method 1, here the results of 2-layer signal analysed with Method 1 are compared to an analysis of a SISO signal, which has been measured according to the EVM measurement definition in TS 38.521-2 Annex E. For signals with 3 DMRS as defined for the UL RMCs the difference is around 0.2 dB, This applies for all different modulations as can be seen from the graphs for QPSK and 64QAM.\nFigure 5.2.3.1.3 -2 presents an evaluation of absolute error vector magnitude (EVM) accuracy for slot length signals using Method 1. The figure illustrates the impact of various parameters on EVM, such as the slot length, guard interval, and timing recovery. The results are presented in a bar chart format, showing the EVM values for different scenarios. The figure highlights the importance of precise timing and synchronization in communication systems, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed method in maintaining low EVM values.Figure 5.2.3.1.3 -2 presents an evaluation of absolute error vector magnitude (EVM) accuracy for slot length signals using Method 1.

While in Figure 5.2.3.1.3.1-3 it can be observed that for reasonable SNR levels, the EVM is only overestimated by less than 0.5 dB, this may still mean that the EVM evaluation is impacted by the different antenna ports or antenna misalignment. Figure 5.2.3.1.3.1-4 shows that the EVM evaluation is independent of those factors and the same results are obtained for different combinations of antenna ports and misalignments.\nFigure 5.2.3.1.3 -3 presents a method for evaluating the Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) of a signal, specifically for two different matrices: an identity matrix and a rotation matrix. The identity matrix is a square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere, while the rotation matrix is a matrix that represents a rotation in a specific coordinate system. The figure illustrates the process of calculating EVM for both matrices, which is an important metric in assessing the quality of a signal transmission. The EVM is a measure of the distortion in a digital communication system and is used to quantify the performance of the system. The figure provides a clear and concise visual representation of the mathematical calculations involved in the EVM evaluation process.Figure 5.2.3.1.3 -3 presents a method for evaluating the Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) of a signal, specifically for two different matrices: an identity matrix and a rotation matrix.

The data points are color-coded to represent different ports, with the legend on the right side of the figure. The results indicate that antenna misalignments have a significant impact on the EVM, with lower values corresponding to better performance. The figure highlights the importance of proper antenna alignment in maintaining high-quality signal transmission.\nFigure 5.2.3.1.3.1-4: Method 1 EVM results for different antenna misalignments and ports\nBased on the analysis shown in section 5.2.3.1.3.1 it is recommended to adapt Method 1 as the enhanced test method for UL MIMO demodulation measurement. Further implementation details to ensure that the results among different TE vendors are comparable, are up to RAN5 definition.\n",

The plot shows how the PSD difference decreases as the angular separation between the CCs increases, indicating that spatial filtering helps to mitigate inter-frequency interference and improve signal quality. The figure is a valuable tool for analyzing the performance of communication systems in terms of angular separation and spatial filtering.\nFigure 5.3.2.1.1-1: Spatially filtered PSD difference vs. angular separation between CCs\nTable 5.3.2.1.1-2 below summarizes the simulation results.\nTable 5.3.2.1.1-2: Simulation results for spatially filtered PSD difference vs. angular separation between CCs\n\nThe requirement for inter-band CA between bands n261 and n260 is defined assuming a non-zero PSD difference between the component carriers.  This assumption holds for the class of inter-band CA configurations to which the independent beam management (IBM) type is applicable. It is observed that at least for IBM inter-band CA requirements, AoA offsets of up to 7 degrees between two FR2 CA component carriers do not significantly impact the PSD difference assumption taken for the core requirement. This observation should be double-checked after the band n262 requirements are finalized and the scope of CA configurations with n262 are understood.\nFurther note that as part of the Rel-17 FR2 RF enhancement work item, RAN4 is discussing the potential definition of requirements assuming common beam management (CBM) for combination of certain band groups, such as 28+28 GHz.  An analysis of the impact of AoA offsets in the test setup for inter-band CA with CBM is needed after the scope of CBM requirements and associated agreements are better understood.\nFollowing a similar simulation methodology as described in 5.3.2.1.1, an analysis of the impact of an AoA offset ranging from 0 to 7 degrees was analyzed for UE supporting common beam management.  The gain difference between the CCs is a test case parameter informed by the recent agreement on the PSD difference in the REFSENS and EIS spherical coverage requirement for DL inter-band CA within FR2 [2].  The simulation assumptions are shown in Table 5.3.2.1.2-1 below.\nTable 5.3.2.1.2-1: Simulation assumptions for PSD imbalance with CBM\n\nFor each AoA offset the PSD difference between CC1 and CC2 was calculated after spatially filtering the signal with the array response pattern corresponding to each CC.  Figure 5.3.2.1.2-1 below illustrates the simulation results.\na) Figure 5.3.2.1.2-1 presents a comparison of the spatially filtered Power Spectral Density (PSD) difference between closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced b) Figure 5.3.2.1.2-1 presents a comparison of the spatially filtered Power Spectral Density (PSD) difference between closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced closely spaced\nFigure 5.3.2.1.2-1: Spatially filtered PSD difference vs. angular separation between CCs; a) Case 1 (24.25 + 29.5 GHz); b) Case 2 (37.0 + 43.5 GHz)\nTable 5.3.2.1.2-2 below summarizes the simulation results.\nTable 5.3.2.1.2-2: Simulation results for spatially filtered PSD difference vs. angular separation between CCs\n\nBecause RAN4 is still discussing the potential introduction of requirements for CBM CA between bands within the same band group (as of #98-e meeting 2021 Jan.), the PSD difference analysis in this subclause assumes a convergence toward 0 dB PSD difference or, in the case of bands with different spherical coverage requirements, for the difference to be bounded by the difference in spherical coverage EIS values.\nWe note that because the CBM CA architecture is, in essence, an optimization, the UE receiver is more sensitive to PSD differences beyond those assumed for the core requirement.  Although Table 5.3.2.1.2-2 indicates that the maximum excess PSD difference due to AoA offset ≤ 1.7 dB which is applicable only to PC3 UE, this effect compounds with the beam squint impairment.\nAgain noting that the core requirement work on CBM CA is still ongoing, it is not possible to use the results to disqualify the proposed AoA offset method from applicability to CBM CA test cases. However, the impact of AoA offset on PSD difference assumptions made in the core requirement definition should be taken into account.\nThe IFF system for FR2 UE OTA testing is constructed around an offset parabolic mirror to collimate beams from a test antenna towards the UE. The architecture allows for a quiet zone (QZ) roughly the size of the spot on the mirror illuminated by the source. The key to this architecture is locating the source at the focus of the parabola that describers the mirror.\nThe burgeoning number of FR2 bands place increasing demands on both, the antenna, as well as the RFFE in test equipment.\nThe effect of off-focus test system antenna in IFF systems was studied before listing ramifications to inter-band test requirements. The components of the IFF are much larger than the wavelength of signals under test. The primary effect of the EM solution to the IFF problem can hence be determined by an equivalent optics problem.\nFrom the geometry of a parabola, there is a unique location (the focus) that allows a test antenna to appear as a far-field antenna after reflection off the mirror. The far-field characteristic comes from the wavefront geometry that is transformed by the mirror from spherical to planar. The planar wavefront is normal to the optical axis of the mirror. Unfortunately, the favorable characteristics of the parabolic mirror are limited to proper placement of the source, and optical aberration is expected outside the geometry demands specific to the mirror in use. For example, in astronomy, the ‘coma’ aberration has long been associated with telescopes when wavefronts of incoming light are not normal to the optical axis.\nTo simplify the problem, the following assumptions were made about the IFF system, which was modelled with a 2D ray tracer:\n1.\tThe TE antenna was modelled as a point light source with uniform illumination in the hemisphere facing the mirror, and no illumination facing the source.\n2.\tLight not incident on the mirror was modelled as being perfectly absorbed by the background\n3.\tEdge effects of the mirror were not considered\n4.\tThe primary focal length was chosen to be 0.65m, for an effective focal length with the offset mirror of ~ 0.7m. The mirror offset was such that the mirror extended from y = 0.2 m to y = 0.5 m off the optical axis.\n5.\tQZ plane was placed orthogonal to the optical axis 1.5 m away from the point where the axis intersects the parabola.\n6.\tSource-to-source interaction, in case of multiple sources, are neglected\n7.\tEM field perturbation due to presence of positioner or DUT fixturing is neglected by virtue of choosing an optic method\n8.\tLight source locations considered (d,h defined in figure 5.3.2.2.1-1):\nNote that assumption #1 is not valid for typical horn antennae, but the uniform illumination assumption serves as a good reference point for studying power variation across the QZ when the source is moved off-focus.\nTable 5.3.2.2.1-1: Source locations\n\nFigures 5.3.2.2.1-1 shows the position of the mirror relative to the sources, as well as the illumination levels at the QZ (sub figure 1b). The blue curve in the sub-figure 1b indicates 2 things about a source at the focus (location1). The first observation is that the nominal QZ is located between y = 0.2 and y=0.5, which coincides with the mirror extents in the y-dimension. This detail is expected. The second observation is that an isotropic source gets transformed to a non-uniform illumination at the QZ.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.1-1 presents a detailed analysis of a telecommunication system, focusing on the power density distortion from the source to point QZ. The figure is divided into two parts, a and b, to illustrate the relationship between the mirror and source locations, as well as the power density distribution along the path.\n\nIn part a, the figure shows the source and mirror locations, with the source emitting electromagnetic waves that are reflected by the mirror. This setup allows for the study of the power density distribution as the waves travel from the source to the receiver, represented by point QZ.\n\nPart b of the figure provides a visual representation of the power density distortion along the path from the source to QZ. The distortion is likely due to various factors such as atmospheric conditions, reflections from obstacles, and the characteristics of the transmission medium.\n\nThe figure is essential for understanding the impact of these factors on the overall signal quality and performance in telecommunication systems, particularly in scenarios where the signal must travel long distances or through challenging environments.Figure 5.3.2.2.1-1 presents a comprehensive analysis of a telecommunication system, focusing on the power density distortion from the source to point QZ.

In the example locations studied, the beam develops a down tilt, but an up tilt is also possible if the source is moved to a location, say, below and to the left of the focus in figure 1a.\nIn figure 5.3.2.2.1-2, it is observed that the wavefront also starts to deviate from being purely orthogonal to the optical axis. The wavefront shape is consistent with the ‘beam tilt’ observation made earlier.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.1-2 illustrates the wavefront orientation at the Quantum Zone (QZ) due to an off-focus source. The figure depicts the wavefront curvature and its impact on the image quality, with the focal length and aperture size influencing the final outcome. The visual representation includes a source emitting light, a lens system, and the resulting image on a screen, highlighting the diffraction pattern and the angle of the wavefront. This analysis is crucial for understanding the effects of lens design and optical system optimization in imaging applications.Figure 5.3.2.2.1-2 presents the wavefront orientation at the Quantum Zone (QZ) due to an off-focus source, illustrating the impact of wavefront curvature on image quality. The figure depicts a light source, a lens system, and the resulting image on a screen, with the focal length and aperture size influencing the final outcome. The diffraction pattern and angle of the wavefront are highlighted, emphasizing the importance of lens design and optical system optimization in imaging applications.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.1-2: Wavefront orientation at QZ due to off-focus source\nFor a UE’s perspective on off-focus sources, candidate source locations were characterized by their angular locations relative to mirror normal. Note that the focus is off the mirror normal due to ‘offset mirror’ geometry, so it has a non-zero value. In the example studied, the focus is 15.4 degrees below mirror normal, and the other off-focus source locations studied all have lower angular offsets than the focus. In figure 5.3.2.2.1-3 we show that the rate of increase beam tilt and the rate of increase in angular offset of the source are very similar, i.e close to 1:1 for the geometry studied.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.1-3 illustrates the effect of off-focus on the beam tilt in a telecommunication system. The figure depicts a source emitting light with a specific beam pattern, which is then focused onto a receiver. As the source becomes less focused, the beam pattern spreads out, causing the beam tilt to increase. This can lead to a decrease in signal strength and quality, as the beam no longer aligns perfectly with the receiver. The figure shows how adjusting the focus of the source can help mitigate this issue and improve the overall performance of the telecommunication system.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.1-3: Beam tilt due to off-focus source\nRecall that the nominal QZ location is the illuminated spot in the plane of the QZ when the source is located at the focus of the mirror. In case of our example, the nominal QZ extends from (x=1.5, y= 0.2) to (x=1.5, y= 0.5). Beam tilt causes the illuminated spot in the plane of the QZ to move off the nominal QZ location. When multiple sources illuminate the mirror, the effective QZ size reduces to the common area across the beams from all sources. Beam tilt consequently has the effect of reducing the effective QZ size. See figure 5.3.2.2.1-4. The reduction in size is a function of both, the angular offset between source and focus, and the distance of the QZ from the mirror.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.1-4 illustrates the impact of beam tilt on the size of the Quad-band Zero (QZ) region in a telecommunication system. The figure shows how the beam tilt angle affects the coverage area, with the QZ region shrinking as the tilt angle increases. This is crucial for optimizing the performance of the system, as it ensures that the beam remains focused on the user equipment (UE) while minimizing interference with neighboring cells. The figure also highlights the importance of precise beamforming techniques in maintaining signal quality and coverage in a multi-antenna environment.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.1-4: Beam tilt causes QZ size reduction\nNow, different UE power classes have different beam shapes, and different beam packing densities. For power class 1, 3dB beam widths are expected to be between 5 and 10 degrees as an extreme example. A beam tilt in the range of a few degrees could cause a PC1 UE to select a different beam for an off-focus source, relative to a source at the focus.\nUE size also limits how close to the mirror the QZ plane can be moved. The radiating face of PC1 device can measure in the 10s of cm in each dimension, which would force the QZ far away from the mirror. This restriction would, in turn, cause much greater reduction in QZ size for a given beam tilt angle, when using multiple sources. These problems would be less serious for PC3 devices.\nIn a case a test antenna is located simply off the position from a focal point (normally at a position of a main test antenna) in the IFF test system, a centre of a beam from the offset feed antenna would shift depending on a distance of focal length (f), a distance between the reflector and a centre of a quiet zone (r), and a distance of the antenna offset (δ). Figure 5.3.2.2.1-5 depicts the relationship of this shift (δ’).\nFigure 5.3.2.2.1-5 illustrates the offset of the antenna beam peak from the center of the QZ in a top-down view of an IFF test system. The figure depicts the antenna elements, the beamforming array, and the positioning of the QZ (Quadrant Zone) in relation to the antenna elements. The offset is crucial for optimizing the signal reception and coverage in the given test environment. The visual representation provides a clear understanding of how the antenna elements and the beamforming array interact to achieve the desired signal distribution within the QZ.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.1-5: Offset of antenna beam peak from centre of QZ (Top view of IFF test system)\nHere the shift (δ’) can be calculated geometrically by the following equation, and it may cause an increase of QoQZ measurement uncertainty in a 30 cm quiet zone.\n\nFrom our experience to date, an electric field intensity in a quiet zone when a feed antenna is located near a focal point is decided by two factors, an antenna pattern of the feed antenna for a test equipment and a shape of the reflector. Especially the antenna pattern can be assumed as the main factor to decide this characteristic, which is directly connected also to the QoQZ.\nBased on this observation an estimation was made with an impact of the offset antenna to QoQZ from an experimental data which was obtained by measuring the electric field intensity of a feed antenna via a reflector. Figure 5.3.2.2.1-6 shows one of the experimental data obtained by scanning the field intensity in a range of +/- 200 mm from a centre of the quiet zone.  Here a 40.8 GHz vertical polarization beam was scanned along with theta (x) direction.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.1-6 illustrates the electric field intensity of a feed antenna scanned along the theta direction at a frequency of 40.8 GHz with a vertical polarization (V-pol). The figure depicts the distribution of electric field strength in the surrounding area, with the antenna positioned at the center. The intensity is measured in decibel milliwatts per meter squared (dBm/m²), providing a quantitative measure of the electromagnetic field strength. The scan shows how the electric field varies with the angle of the antenna relative to the horizontal plane, which is crucial for understanding the radiation pattern and optimizing antenna performance. The visual representation aids in the analysis of the antenna's radiation characteristics and its interaction with the environment, which is essential for designing and deploying wireless communication systems.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.1-6: Electric field intensity of feed antenna scanned along with theta direction (40.8 GHz, V-pol)\nTable 5.3.2.2.1-2 and Figure 5.3.2.2.1-7 show the estimation of difference between the QoQZ of main antenna and of the offset antenna. Note that these values are specific to the feed antenna (amplitude taper) in this experiment and thus they may vary depending on an antenna pattern used by each test equipment vendor.\nTable 5.3.2.2.1-2: Estimation of QoQZ difference between main and offset antenna\n\nFigure 5.3.2.2.1-7 presents a detailed plot of the QoQZ difference, illustrating the performance of a telecommunication system over time. The graph showcases the fluctuations in the quality of service (QoQZ) difference, which is a critical metric for assessing the efficiency and reliability of the system. The plot includes various data points and trends, providing valuable insights into the system's behavior and potential areas for improvement. The x-axis represents the time period, while the y-axis represents the QoQZ difference, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the system's performance over time.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.1-7: Plot of QoQZ difference\nThough these differences may vary depending on an antenna pattern (amplitude taper) of a feed antenna, as can be seen from above, there is a chance that the difference of QoQZ due to the offset antenna can be limited within an acceptable level by optimizing an arrangement of antennas.\nAs described above, these QoQZ differences are estimated based on the antenna configuration with which the offset antenna is simply off the position from a focal point. And there is a way to mitigate the impact of the offset antenna to the actual QoQZ.\nOne of major factors to decide QoQZ is the electric field intensity in the quiet zone. Figure 5.3.2.2.1-8 depicts a 2D-image of the electric field intensity (amplitude taper) in the quiet zone when the offset antenna is used. As shown in the figure, due to the shift of beam centre from the main antenna, distribution of the field intensity becomes asymmetric in the quiet zone and thus it causes the increase of the QoQZ MU value. However it is possible to shift the beam peak position by tilting the offset antenna and make the distribution of the field intensity close to symmetric in the quiet zone like the one from the main antenna, allowing us to mitigate the impact of beam centre shift to the QoQZ value. Figure 5.3.2.2.1-9 depicts the image of the improvement with the offset antenna placement. At the same time, there might be diffraction and/or scattering effects created by the reflector’s paraboloid edges and the size of the paraboloid that impact  the QoQZ characteristics. Thus, there should be some limitations with antenna offset ranges and angles to tilt the offset antenna that depend on a relationship between reflector size, measurement antenna offset and range length. All these factors should be considered during the design of the test system.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.1-8 presents a 2D image of the electric field intensity (amplitude taper) in the quiet zone from an offset antenna. The image illustrates the distribution of the electric field, with the quiet zone being the area where the intensity is minimal. The figure highlights the taper effect, where the electric field intensity decreases as the distance from the antenna increases. This information is crucial for understanding the propagation of electromagnetic waves and designing antennas for optimal performance.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.1-8: 2D image of the electric field intensity (amplitude taper) in the quiet zone from an offset antenna\nFigure 5.3.2.2.1-9 presents a 2D image of the electric field intensity in the quiet zone from a tilted offset antenna, illustrating the distribution of electromagnetic waves in the surrounding area. The image showcases the intensity patterns of the electric field, with varying levels of strength indicated by color gradients. The figure highlights the antenna's directional characteristics and the propagation of the electromagnetic waves in the specified frequency range. The visual representation is crucial for understanding the antenna's radiation pattern and its impact on the surrounding environment, which is essential for optimizing communication systems and minimizing interference.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.1-9: 2D image of the electric field intensity in the quiet zone from a tilted offset antenna\nThere is another way of recovering desired QZ illumination. In Figure 5.3.2.2.1-4, it is shown that beam tilt causes reduction in size of QZ that is common to all source locations. This mechanism is intuitive and can be pre-compensated during design of the test system.\nThe matter of QZ quality however involves more complexity. As a first approximation, QZ quality can be quantified by the illumination distribution from a hypothetical constant density source illuminating the mirror. Here it becomes evident that angular offset of the antenna alone is not enough to determine illumination distribution. See figure 5.3.2.2.1-10. Locations 2, 3 and 4 all have approximately the same angular offset (<0.5 degree difference), but their QZ illumination can be made better or worse than that of the on-focus source by adjusting mirror to source distance. In the graphic example, the source location closest to the mirror has the least variation QZ illumination.\nIt is therefore possible to recover desired QZ illumination by adjusting the source location distance from mirror in concert with angular offset. A discussion regarding whether the different QoQZ MU needs to be applied compared to the single carrier case can be left to RAN5.\nAs shown later in the discussion of wavefront shapes however (see sub-clause 5.3.2.2.3), there are other constraints governing offset source to mirror distance.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.1-10 illustrates the reflection and distribution of light at various locations, with specific focus on mirror and source positions. The figure shows that locations 2, 3, and 4 exhibit similar offsets, while their respective illumination distributions at QZ differ. This information is crucial for understanding the behavior of light in this particular setup and can be used to analyze the effects of different mirror and source configurations on the overall illumination pattern.Figure 5.3.2.2.1-10 presents a detailed analysis of light reflection and distribution across various locations, with a specific focus on the positions of mirrors and sources. The figure reveals that locations 2, 3, and 4 exhibit similar offsets, indicating a consistent behavior in the light's path. However, the illumination distributions at QZ differ significantly between these locations, highlighting the impact of different mirror and source configurations on the overall pattern. This information is essential for comprehending the behavior of light in this particular setup and can be employed to evaluate the effects of various mirror and source arrangements on the final illumination outcome.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.1-10: a: Mirror and source locations. Locations 2, 3 and 4 have similar offset; b: Locations 2, 3 and 4 cause different illumination distribution at QZ\nIn this sub-clause, an explanation is shown that it is possible to measure the appropriate EIS spherical coverage beam profiles by the test system which equips the non co-located (offset) antenna even with the inter-band 2 DL CA cases as long as the UE is supporting the independent beam management (IBM).\nFirst we consider a single carrier Rx spherical coverage beam profile which we can obtain by two kinds of antennae. If we compare Rx beam profiles of two different cases, one which has been measured by main antenna of the OTA test system, or the other with which the DL beam frequency is same but has been measured from the offset antenna, both beam profiles can be assumed identical as far as following conditions are satisfied.\n-\tTwo measurement antennae (main and offset) are arranged along with the θ rotation of the positioner\n-\tDL power of the offset antenna is calibrated and capable of transmitting same power level with the main measurement antenna.\nFor the rotation angles of positioner, refer to Annex D.2.6 in TS 38.810 [3].\nFigure 5.3.2.2.2-1 depicts the image of two beam profiles obtained by different antennae. Note that the profiles are obtained one by one since the link has to be maintained with either of antennae during the measurement.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.2-1 presents a 2D image of a beam profile obtained by two antennae, illustrating the directional radiation pattern of the telecommunication system. The image shows the main lobe, side lobes, and nulls, which are crucial for understanding the antenna's performance in terms of gain, directivity, and interference rejection. The main lobe is the strongest signal area, while the side lobes and nulls indicate areas with weaker or no signal reception. This information is essential for optimizing antenna placement and system design to ensure efficient and reliable communication.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.2-1: 2D image of beam profile obtained by two antennae\nIf we compare the two measurements, a difference between them are just a point of sight from the UE, in other words a boresight of UE is slightly rotated depending on the arrangement of measured antennae.\nThere is an angular offset between the two measurement antennae such as 2.5 to 7 degrees. Therefore to compare the two obtained beam profiles, rotation of either one of profiles in accordance with the actual antenna alignment is necessary. Also the adjustment of the start/ stop coordinates to measure is necessary with a case of the offset antenna.\nNow we consider beam profiles which are obtained by the test system that transmits two DL signals from single antenna (system A), and the system which has one additional offset antenna to transmit two DL signals - one DL from the main antenna and the other from the offset antenna (system B). For inter-band 2 DL CA case for example with band n260 and n261, suppose only system B transmits n261 from the offset antenna, properties of each beam profile are summarized in Table 5.3.2.2.2-1. Note that 2 measurement antennae of system B are assumed to be arranged along with the θ rotation of the positioner again just as mentioned above.\nTable 5.3.2.2.2-1: Beam profiles obtained by system A and system B in a case with IBM antennae in a UE\nTaking all explanations above into consideration, system B requires a post processing of the obtained data in accordance with the slightly rotated coordinate system. But the obtained beam profiles can be assumed as identical with ones obtained by system A as far as the UE is supporting the IBM. i.e. There is a way to make IBM UEs to choose same relative beam direction and conduct spherical coverage tests properly like a single test antenna system.\nChoice of the beam by UEs with common beam management (CBM) is studied at the next sub-clause.\nThe primary mechanism that can mislead CBM UEs is band-specific beam tilt in the test setup. As shown in sub-clause 5.3.2.2.1, beam tilt at the QZ is roughly 1:1 with source angular offset. In the spherical coverage space of a UE, beam tilt becomes a significant problem for beam management at beam boundaries. The impact to measured performance is directly related to probability of finding a beam boundary during 3D search. Beam tilt therefore penalizes UEs with dense beam packing (i.e more beam boundaries).\nDense beam packing is often associated with UEs with good spherical coverage. It can be reasonably argued that the impact of beam tilt in this context is worse for UEs with better spherical coverage. This problem does not have a systematic effect across all UE designs and therefore difficult to overcome.\nAnother important characteristic of a far field scenario is a nearly planar wavefront. Figures 5.3.2.2.3-1 shows the deviation from planar wavefront at the QZ when the source is moved off-focus. As before, in the figures below, locations 2,3 and 4 have similar angular offset, but differ in mirror to source distance. The figures show that there is an optimal distance from the mirror for any angular offset of the source, for the wavefront to appear planar at the QZ.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.3-1 illustrates the wavefront orientation at the focus point (QZ) due to an off-focus source. The figure depicts the light rays diverging from the source, with the wavefront curvature affecting the angle at which they reach the focus point. The diagram highlights the importance of proper focus in optical systems, as it directly impacts the quality of the image or pattern formed by the light. The visual representation of the wavefront curvature provides a clear understanding of how off-focus conditions can lead to blurred or distorted images.Figure 5.3.2.2.3-1 illustrates the wavefront orientation at the focus point (QZ) due to an off-focus source.

The diagram highlights the importance of proper focus in optical systems, as it directly impacts the quality of the image or pattern formed by the light. The visual representation of the wavefront curvature provides a clear understanding of how off-focus conditions can lead to blurred or distorted images.\nFigure 5.3.2.2.3-1: Wavefront orientation at QZ due to off-focus source\nAlso note that positioning an offset source at the optimal distance may not result in optimal illumination density of the QZ. From a beam management standpoint however, it is more important to ensure quality of the wavefront given that the deviation in illumination density seems minor. (Explanation: Position 3 is close to the optimal point, as witnessed by its nearly flat wavefront in figures 5.3.2.2.3-1. In figure 5.3.2.2.3-1, illumination density curves of location 3 and location 1, the focus or ‘ideal location’, track closely)\nThe figures 5.3.2.2.3-1 also reasonably predict that the non-linear phase variation varies with frequency. Ergo, it is advantageous to reserve the ideal location (focus) for the antenna serving the highest frequencies and use offset locations for antennae serving lower frequencies.\nFor inter-band CA requirements within 28 GHz range (L + L) or 39 GHz range (H + H) which has a possibility of transmissions by CBM, a simulation was made on the influence of the offset antenna measurement for inter-band CA case with CBM UE. From this simulation we tried to clarify a difference with the measurement of 2 DL by 1 AoA at a frequency range from 37 GHz and 43.5 GHz.\nAssumption of the UE antenna inter-element distance\nIt is difficult for us to expect an actual inter-element distance (D) of an antenna in the current UE since it is implementation dependent. But as a starting point, during this simulation we put an assumption that an optimization of the inter-element distance is made at the centre frequency between the lower edge of band n258 (24.25 GHz) and higher edge of n259 (43.5 GHz), i.e. 33.875 GHz where D/λ becomes 0.5.\nTable 5.3.2.2.4-1: Optimized frequency and corresponding ratio (D/l) for simulation frequencies\n\nAssumption of phase shifter in a UE\nFor a beam forming method of the UE, following two methods were applied in the simulation.\ni)\tA fixed phase shift to the antenna regardless with the carrier frequencies, which we assume this method is causing the beam squint.\nii)\tA different phase shift which is proportional to the carrier frequencies so called true time delay (TTD).\nSimulation procedures for spherical coverage\nThe simulation of the spherical coverage measurement was carried out by the following steps.\nStep 1)\tDecide a code book to obtain the maximum sensitivity at frequency 1 (37.0 GHz) with a measurement grid placed randomly against a DUT.\nStep 2)\tKeep the identified code book at step 1) and calculate gain profiles at frequency 2 (43.5 GHz). Then compare the following two cases.\nCase 1)\tGain profile at frequency 2 measured by the main antenna\n-\tOnly the difference of the ratio (D/λ) can be monitored as the difference from the frequency 1. This result can be assumed as a baseline when comparing the influence of the offset antenna measurement.\nCase 2)\tGain profile at frequency 2 measured by the offset antenna\n-\tIn addition to the difference of the ratio (D/λ), influence of the offset antenna is included in this result. (e.g. influence to the measurement grid due to the offset of the antenna.)\nSimulation parameter\nSimulation parameters are summarized in Table 5.3.2.2.4-2.\nTable 5.3.2.2.4-2: Simulation parameter for spherical coverage gain profile\n\nSpherical coverage simulation result\nSimulation results of the spherical coverage are summarized in Table 5.3.2.2.4-3 and 5.3.2.2.4-4.\nTable 5.3.2.2.4-3: Simulation result of spherical coverage – Mean 50%-ile error (against 1deg uniform grid as a reference)\n\nTable 5.3.2.2.4-4: Simulation result of spherical coverage – Standard deviation of 50%-ile value\n\nComparing the results between the main antenna and offset antenna, we observed that the mean error by measuring from the offset antenna increases slightly with both non-TTD and TTD type phase shifter (0.085 dB with non-TTD and 0.116 dB with TTD at 43.5 GHz.). This means that the total measurement uncertainty by measuring from offset antenna will increase approximately 0.1 dB as the systematic uncertainty.\nFor the standard deviation, only the result with TTD phase shifter showed the slight increase of measurement uncertainty (0.057 at 43.5 GHz.). However this increase of random uncertainty should be a negligible level compared to the other uncertainty contribution.\nTherefore for both mean error (systematic error) and standard deviation (random error) with offset antenna, these values are within the acceptable level because the simulation assumptions in this paper are chosen as one of the severest conditions from the viewpoint of the frequency point to optimize inter-element distance, test frequencies, basic frequency point of phase shift, etc. And since the optimization of the inter-element distance was assumed at 33.875 GHz, if this optimization is made at a higher frequency such as at the middle of 37 GHz and 43.5 GHz, the observed uncertainty should be decreased.\nConsidering all the observations above, we assume that the FR2 OTA test system with the offset test antenna has a feasibility of measuring inter-band DL CA test cases for both CBM and IBM UEs under some limitations.\nFor cases with UEs which supports wider frequencies (such as n262 in addition) or higher power such as PC1 need a further study.\nTaking into consideration of study results in sub-clause 5.3.2.1 and 5.3.2.2, an applicability of the offset antenna test system to the spherical coverage test with an inter-band CA UE is summarized as follows.\nIBM UE:\nOn a test for UEs supporting inter-band CA with IBM, there is a way to make IBM UEs to choose same relative beam direction and conduct spherical coverage tests properly like a single test antenna system. It is recommended that a design of the test system is optimized to mitigate an impact of the offset antenna to the QoQZ measurement uncertainty, including the diffraction and/or scattering effects created by the reflector’s paraboloid edges and the size of the paraboloid.\nCBM UE:\nOn a test for UEs supporting inter-band CA with CBM, there might be a limitation with the feasibility by the offset antenna test system. But this relates also to the on-going WI discussion on the necessity of spherical coverage requirements with CBM UEs supporting a same band group e.g. 28 GHz + 28 GHz.\nTo design FR2 OTA IFF test system for inter-band CA UE, following points were analyzed in the previous sub-clauses with regards to an impact of off-focus test antennae.\n-\tDistance (and angular offset) between the main antenna and the offset antenna\n-\tArrangement of the offset antenna\n-\tAngle to fix (tilt) the offset antenna\n-\tDistance between the offset antenna and a reflector\n-\tArrangement of antennae associated with their frequency coverage\nWe pick out and iterate examples from the previous analyses which need to be considered during a design of the test system to minimize impacts from the offset antenna. We also consider further with their feasibility from some other aspects e.g. another affecting factor, actual system assembly procedures and test operations.\n\nDistance (and angular offset) between main antenna and offset antenna\nBased on the assumption that a range length in an IFF chamber is from 800 mm to 1200 mm, antenna offset from 50 mm to 100 mm were studied. These offsets are equivalent to approximately 2.5 to 7 degrees as an angular offset. And due to a shift of focal point from a centre of the quiet zone, approximately 0.15 dB degradation of the quality of quiet zone MU is estimated at the frequency range from 23.45 to 40.8 GHz. Note the estimation may vary depending on components and system designs in each vendor.\nFrom the previous studies, it is obvious that the impact is proportional to the distance between antennae. From this point it is preferrable that each antenna is arranged as close as possible. However another effect of mutual coupling arises if the gap becomes too close like that of one wavelength (i.e. approximately 10 mm around 30 GHz.). Though we can assume that the effect can be included while evaluating the quality of quiet zone, at the same time when we think of an assembly of cables to each antenna, some clearances must be ensured and thus a gap around 40 to 50 mm between antennae is considered possible closest distance.\n\nArrangement of the offset antenna\nOn condition that a DUT is supporting IBM, we have a chance to carry out the inter-band CA test case with the offset antenna test system equivalent to the system only with the main antenna. To obtain identical beam profiles from both of main and offset antenna, following conditions need to be satisfied:\n-\tTwo measurement antennae (main and offset) are arranged along with the θ rotation of the positioner\n-\tDL power of the offset antenna is calibrated and capable of transmitting same power level with the main measurement antenna.\nSince there is an angular offset between the two measurement antennae such as 2.5 to 7 degrees, to compare the two obtained beam profiles, a post processing of obtained data is necessary with either one of profiles in accordance with the actual antenna alignment. Also the adjustment of the start/ stop coordinates to measure is necessary with the offset antenna.\n\nAngle to fix (tilt) the offset antenna\nIt is recommended that also an angle to fix (tilt) the offset antenna is considered while designing the test system. It is possible to shift the electric field intensity by tilting the offset antenna (e.g. 0.5 to 0.7 degree) and make the distribution of the field intensity, in other words an amplitude taper, close to symmetric in the quiet zone like the one from the main antenna. However since the applicable tilt angles are closely related with a size of reflector and the range length, there should be some limitations and care must be taken to avoid diffraction and/or scattering effects created by the reflector’s paraboloid edges.\n\nDistance between the offset antenna and a reflector\nIt is possible to optimize the shape of wavefront and illumination at the centre of the quiet zone by adjusting a distance between the offset antenna and a reflector. However since the QZ illumination also depends on the frequency of beam, and considering the current frequency range of mmWave region, which is wide spread from 24 GHz to 52 GHz, it is not practical to change the distance for each antenna one by one. Also when we consider a design that the placement of the offset antenna is above the main antenna, there might be another factor to increase the measurement uncertainty since coordinates of the measurement grid changes. Thus as mentioned above, it is recommended that antennas are arranged along with the θ rotation of the positioner\n\nArrangement of antennae associated with their frequency coverage\nIt is predicted that the non-linear phase variation varies with frequency. Ergo, it is advantageous to reserve the ideal location (focus) for the antenna serving the highest frequencies and use offset locations for antennae serving lower frequencies.\n",

On-focus single antenna IFF systems have already been studied and their MU quantified, and do not need to be considered again in this context. Non-ideal (off-focus) location causes the following problems:\n-\tA shifted QZ due to beam tilt. Note however that all bands have the same AoA at the UE.\n-\tBeam tilt causes the AoA to no longer be parallel to the optical axis. This aspect must be properly considered during system calibration; for example, a directional calibration antenna placed at the QZ must be pointed accurately along the arrival direction for an accurate path loss estimate.\nProvided the problems above are accounted for, UEs with either CBM or IBM can tolerate an IFF system with an off-focus source.\nThe assumption for inter-band testing in this context is that the bands are supported through multiple non-co-located test system antennae. For this set up, the considerations listed in the single antenna case get further complicated.\n-\tA reduction in QZ size due to different beam tilt experienced by different bands.\n-\tBeam tilt causes different AoA for different bands. There are two problems associated with this aspect:\n-\tCalibration for each band will require adjustment of a directional calibration antenna so it is pointed along arrival direction of band being calibrated.\n-\tThis set up can be perceived as ‘non-co-located’ gNBs by some UEs.\nThe calibration step complication, and the QZ size reduction may be surmountable, but the non-co-located gNB implication can cause significant problems for UEs with CBM limitation.\nA special note is warranted for ACS and IBB requirements – the standard requires that the interferer share the same AoA as the DL band being tested. Fortunately, ACS and IBB interferers are expected to be in the same band as the DL being tested, so it would be natural for the test equipment to use the same antenna for both. If such is not the case, additional MU would be introduced into the system, which is not preferred.\n",

Although range length for the DFF setup is not a requirement for permitted methods, a reference value of 0.725m is used in the TR38.810 calculations.  Furthermore, the maximum achievable SNR values are calculated assuming the highest band n259 frequency (f=43.5 GHz).  The highest frequency to be considered for the SNR calculation is the highest frequency of band n262:  48.2 GHz.  Using the reference range length of 0.725m we determine free space path loss at f=48.2 GHz, as shown in Figure 7.1-1 below.\nFigure 7.1-1 illustrates the relationship between free space path loss and frequency for a distance of 0.725 meters. The graph shows that path loss increases with frequency, indicating that higher frequencies experience greater attenuation over the same distance. This relationship is crucial for understanding how different frequencies are suited for various communication applications and environments.\nFigure 7.1-1: Free space path loss vs. frequency for d=0.725m\nBased on this analysis, the relative increase in free space path loss from 43.5 GHz to 48.2 GHz is 0.9 dB.\nAnother parameter in the SNR calculation which scales with frequency is cable loss per meter.  Using the datasheets from five different commercially available RF cables, which are rated up to 50 GHz, the average cable loss per meter is calculated (averaging performed in linear gain units), as shown in Figure 7.1-2 below.\nFigure 7.1-2 illustrates the relationship between cable loss per meter and frequency, demonstrating how signal attenuation increases with higher frequencies. The graph plots cable loss in decibels (dB) on the y-axis against frequency in gigahertz (GHz) on the x-axis. The data points show that cable loss increases as frequency rises, with a notable increase at higher GHz values. This information is crucial for designing and optimizing telecommunication systems, as it helps to ensure signal integrity and minimize interference.\nFigure 7.1-2: Cable loss per meter vs. frequency\nBased on this analysis, the relative increase in cable loss per meter from 43.5 GHz to 48.2 GHz is 0.33 dB.\nThe SNR calculation related to cable loss also includes connector losses and additional margin, and it is feasible to reuse these parameters for the calculations related to band n262.\nThe SNR calculation also includes two parameters which are taken from UE RF requirements:  REFSENS and multi-band relaxation.  For REFSENS the recently agreed value of -82.8 dBm/50 MHz is used, and for MBR 1.0 dB (rounded up from 0.7 dB) is used [2].

Annex B.3 in TR38.810 describes the detailed calculations of the maximum achievable SNR by the demodulation test setup.  As an informative assessment, calculation of the maximum testable DL SNR for band n263 is performed below. IFF test method is considered.\nAlthough range length for the DFF setup is not a requirement for permitted methods, a reference value of 0.725m is used in the TR38.810 calculationsThe highest frequency to be considered for the SNR calculation is the highest frequency of band n263:  f=71 GHz.  Using the reference range length of 0.725m we determine free space path loss, together with modeling of atmospheric absorption, at f=71 GHz, as shown in Figure 7.2.3-1 below.\nFigure 7.2.3-1 illustrates the relationship between free space path loss and frequency for a distance of 0.725 meters. The graph shows that path loss increases with frequency, indicating that higher frequencies experience greater attenuation over the same distance. This relationship is crucial for understanding how signal strength varies with frequency in different communication environments.\nFigure 7.2.3-1: Free space path loss vs. frequency for d=0.725m\nWe note that atmospheric attenuation has no impact on path loss at the range scales of an FR2 testing chamber.\nAnother parameter in the SNR calculation which scales with frequency is cable loss per meter.  Using the datasheets from four different commercially available RF cables, which are rated up to at least 90 GHz, we calculate the average cable loss per meter (averaging performed in linear gain units), as shown in Figure 7.2.3-2 below.\nFigure 7.2.3-2 illustrates the relationship between cable loss per meter and frequency, demonstrating how signal attenuation increases with higher frequencies. The graph plots cable loss in decibels (dB) on the y-axis against frequency in gigahertz (GHz) on the x-axis. The data points show that cable loss increases as frequency rises, with a notable increase at higher frequencies. This information is crucial for designing and optimizing telecommunication systems to ensure efficient signal transmission.\nFigure 7.2.3-2: Cable loss per meter vs. frequency\nWe further note that the SNR calculation related to cable loss also includes connector losses and additional margin.Demodulation test system setup parameters required for SNR calculation are summarized in Table 7.2.3-1.\nTable 7.2.3-1: Demodulation test setup SNR calculation parameters for band n263\n\nThe maximum achievable DL SNR is summarized in Table 7.2.3-2.\nTable 7.2.3-2: Maximum DL testable SNR preliminary extension for band n263\n\nA method to adjust ∆thermal value in Noc setting methodology can increase max achievable DL SNR. ∆thermal is the actual difference between UE thermal noise level and wanted noise level. The difference between these levels leads to the difference between baseband SNR and SNR at the reference point. According to the FR2-1 SNR calculation methodology, 6 dB ∆thermal is used that corresponds to 1 dB SNR difference.\nTable 7.2.3-2 below provides evaluations how ∆thermal impacts DL SNR. For simplicity the ∆thermal value is recalculated to allowed SNR difference (allowed noise increase). 400 MHz CBW and -13 dB backoff from P1dB were selected for the analysis. Note that at 3 dB allowed noise increase, Noc level becomes the same as UE thermal noise level.\nTable 7.2.3-3: Allowed noise increase vs max achievable DL SNR\n\nMinimum FR2-1 DL radiated performance requirements are specified for up to Rank 2. The required SNR point is 14.4 and 18.6 dB for 16QAM and 64QAM respectively for 100 MHz and 120 kHz CBW/SCS combination. It can be approximately expected that SNR will not dramatically change for higher CBWs as 400MHz. Same time, some margin on phase noise impact at higher carrier frequency should be considered. For instance, 16 and 20 dB SNRs can be assumed. Such SNR targets require adjustments of TE parameters. Table 7.2.3-4 summarizes required wanted signal + headroom budget to reach 16 and 20 dB DL SNR. The parameters from Table 7.2.3-1 are assumed with RAN4 assumption on backoff from P1dB.\nTable 7.2.3-4: Wanted signal + headroom budget vs max achievable DL SNR\n\nWanted signal + headroom budget can be increased by adjustment of power amplifier 1dB compression point and/or probe antenna gain. Another option how to allow testing of high CBW is to restrict max PRB allocation size within the CBW. As seen from Table 7.2.3-2, 66 PRB allocation size (100 MHz) leads to 7.7 dB max SNR increase compared to 264PRBs in 400 MHz.\n\n\n\n",

The Table 8.2.1-1 and Table 8.2.1-2 outline the antenna patterns for simulation.\nTable 8.2.1-1: Single Antenna Element Radiation Pattern\n\nTable 8.2.1-2: Composite Antenna Array Radiation Pattern\n\nBased on 4x2 antenna array, the following three types of measurement grids need to be derived:\n-\tBeam Peak Search Grid: using this grid, the TX and RX beam peak direction will be determined. 3D EIRP scans are used to determine the TX beam peak direction and 3D Throughput/RSRP/EIS scans for RX beam peak directions.\n-\tSpherical Coverage Grid: using this grid, the CDF of the EIRP/EIS distribution in 3D is calculated to determine the spherical coverage performance.\n-\tTRP Measurement Grid: using this grid, the total power radiated by the DUT in the TX beam peak direction is determined by integrating the EIRP measurements taken on the sampling grid.\nFollowing the analysis approach in TR38.810 Annex G, similar analyses based on 50k simulations have been performed for the 4x2 antenna array assumption. The global beam peak of the 4x2 antenna array was determined first. Subsequently, the relative orientation of the simulated antenna array and the measurement grid was altered randomly.\nSample histograms and CDF distributions for the beam peak error for constant step-size measurement grids are shown in Figure 8.2.1.1-1 and for the constant density measurement grid (based on the charged particle implementation) in Figure 8.2.1.1-2. The histograms show a half-normal distribution.\nGiven the half-normal distribution, the MU term should be based on the determination of the offset from the beam peak that contains 95% of the distribution (alternatively, the value at which the CDF is 5%). This offset shall be considered a systematic error in the MU budget. The various statistical metrics are illustrated in Figure 8.2.1.1-3.\nFigure 8.2.1.1-1 presents a histogram illustrating the distribution of maximum peak errors in a beam measurement, with two distinct measurement grid step sizes: 12 degrees (left) and 15 degrees (right). The histogram shows the frequency of peak errors occurring within a specific range, with the horizontal axis representing the error magnitude and the vertical axis representing the frequency. The two HPBW (Half Power Beam Width) values, 260 degrees and 130 degrees, are indicated at the top of the figure. The histogram reveals that the majority of peak errors fall within a certain range, with a higher frequency at the lower end of the error spectrum. This information is crucial for optimizing the beamforming process and ensuring accurate signal transmission.Figure 8.2.1.1-1 presents a histogram illustrating the distribution of maximum peak errors in a beam measurement, with two distinct measurement grid step sizes: 12 degrees (left) and 15 degrees (right).

The y-axis represents the number of occurrences of each error magnitude. The histogram reveals that the majority of errors occur within a certain range, with a peak at the lower end of the error spectrum. This information is crucial for understanding the performance of the measurement system under different conditions and for optimizing the HPBW angle for maximum accuracy.Figure 8.2.1.1-2 presents a histogram illustrating the distribution of maximum peak errors in a constant density measurement grid, with two distinct grid point densities (320 and 200).

The figure demonstrates the bell-shaped curve typical of a half-normal distribution, with the mean representing the center of the distribution, the standard deviation indicating the spread of the data, and the variance showing the average squared distance from the mean. The figure is useful for understanding the statistical properties of random variables with a specified distribution.\nFigure 8.2.1.1-3: Statistical metrics for a sample half-normal distribution\nThe statistical results from simulations using 50k random orientations are then used for further analyses, summarized in Table 8.2.1.1-1 for constant-step size grids and in Table 8.2.1.1-2 for constant-density grids. The simulation assumptions of the rotations were the same as those outlined in Annex G.1.1 of [3]. it should be noted that these measurement grids are derived without consideration of UE beam steering effect (i.e. beam correspondence).\n\nTable 8.2.1.1-1: Statistical Analyses of the 50k simulations for the constant-step size grids\n\nTable 8.2.1.1-2: Statistical Analyses of the 50k simulations for the constant-density grids\n\nBased on the previously agreed limit of Offset5%CDF of 0.5dB (systematic error), the following minimum number of grid points would be required for Beam Peak Search Grid.\n-\tConstant density grid with at least 275 grid points\n-\tConstant step size grid with at least 366 grid points\nTable 8.2.1.1-3: Min Number of Grid Points for TX/RX Beam Peak Search\n\nThe approximate test times for the 4x2 beam peak searches are as follows:\n-\tConstant-Step Size: TX ~0.7hrs; RX ~4hrs\n-\tConstant Density: TX ~0.5hrs; RX ~3hrs\nThe simulation assumptions including the antenna patterns for the spherical coverage measurement grids are the same as Clause G.3 [3] except the 4x2 antenna array assumptions instead of 8x2.\nAt the 50%-tile CDF, i.e., the target CDF for Power Class 3, statistical analyses of all 10000 EIRPs, EIRP50%CDF, are performed.\nThe simulations in this contribution were only for the case where the beam peak is oriented in completely random orientations, i.e., the beam peak is not always aligned to a grid point. It is understood that the CDF curve cannot be used to accurately determine the TX beam peak (100%-tile CDF)\nUnlike in [3], the simulations here were performed for EIRP only it was shown previously that the EIS simulations with infinitesimal DL power step sizes match the standard deviations of the EIRP results and that a finite DL power step size introduces a mean error that matches the DL power step size.\nThe results for various constant-step size measurement grids are tabulated in Table 8.2.1.2-1 and the grid with similar MUs as previously agreed for the 8x2 based PC3 configuration is highlighted.\nTable 8.2.1.2-1: Statistical results of EIRP50%CDF for the 4x2 antenna array for constant step size measurement grids and the beam peak oriented in completely random orientations.\n\nSimilar results for the constant-density measurement grids are tabulated in Table 8.2.1.2-2 and the grid with similar MUs as previously agreed for the 8x2 based PC3 configuration is highlighted.\nTable 8.2.1.2-2: Statistical results of EIRP50%CDF for the 4x2 antenna array for constant density measurement grids and the beam peak oriented in completely random orientations.\n\nAt least 100 (constant density grid with charged particle implementation) or 146 (constant step size grid with 20deg step size) measurement grid points shall be used for EIRP spherical coverage procedure. Compared with 8x2 antenna array, the factor of improvement based on new measurement grid with 4x2 antenna is about 2, as summarized in the table 8.2.1.2-3.\nTable 8.2.1.2-3: Min Number of Grid Points for Spherical Coverage\n\nThe simulation assumptions including the antenna patterns for the TRP measurement grids are the same as Clause G.2 [3] except a 4x2 antenna array assumption instead of 8x2 for both single-element antenna patterns.\nThe results tabulated in this section outline the results of a statistical analyses with the positioning concept taken into account, i.e., the analyses were performed with and without the assumption that the beam peak direction is oriented away from the hemisphere towards the pole at = 180o. Additionally, the standard deviations are presented when ranges of pattern values are disregarded (zeroed out). For the constant-step size measurement grids, three cases were investigated, i.e., no pattern values are disregarded, values only at one latitude at =180o, and the values at the bottom two latitudes are disregarded. The results with the re-positioning concept applied are summarized in Table 8.2.1.3-1 for the sin(theta) and the Clenshaw-Curtis quadratures while the results without the re-positioning concept applied are summarized in Table 8.2.1.3-2.\nFor the constant density measurement grids, a similar investigation was performed using the Charged Particle implementation. Two cases investigated were: no pattern values are disregarded and values betweenX ≤ ≤ 180o are disregarded. The results with the re-positioning concept applied are summarized in Table 8.2.1.3-2 for the Charged Particle implementation while the results without the re-positioning concept applied are summarized in Table 8.2.1.3-4.\nThe previously agreed limit for the PC3 TRP grids is 0.25dB. Those measurement grids meeting that limit have been highlighted in green while the grids exceeding that limit are highlighted in red. It should be noted that some mean errors are relatively high for grids that meet the 0.25dB std. deviation limit and therefore should not be considered candidate measurement grids.\nTable 8.2.1.3-1: Statistics of quadrature approaches for constant step size measurement grids for the 4x2 antenna array with the re-positioning concept applied.\n\nTable 8.2.1.3-2: Statistics of quadrature approaches for constant step size measurement grids for the 4x2 antenna array without the re-positioning concept applied.\n\nTable 8.2.1.3-3: Statistics for constant density measurement grid types for the 4x2 reference antenna array with the re-positioning concept applied (charged particle implementation only)\n\nTable 8.2.1.3-4: Statistics for constant density measurement grid types for the 4x2 reference antenna array without the re-positioning concept applied (charged particle implementation only)\n\nAccording to the above analysis, the following conclusions can be made:\n-\tIf the re-positioning concept is not applied to TRP test cases:\n-\t40 measurement grid points for constant density grid – Charged Particle implementation, with standard deviation of 0.17dB.\n-\t8 latitudes and 14 longitudes (84 grid points) for constant step size grid – sin (theta) weights integration approach, with standard deviation of 0.20dB with the allowance to skip and interpolate measurements at the pole at =180o.\n-\t7 latitudes and 12 longitudes (62 grid points) for constant step size grid – Clenshaw Curtis weights integration approach, with standard deviation of 0.22 dB with the allowance to skip and interpolate measurements at the pole at =180o\n-\tIf the re-positioning concept is applied to TRP test cases:\n-\t50 measurement grid points for constant density grid – Charged Particle implementation, with standard deviation of 0.21 dB with the allowance to skip and interpolate measurements beyond 150o in \n-\t8 latitudes and 14 longitudes (86 grid points) for constant step size grid – sin (theta) weights integration approach, with standard deviation of 0.19dB with the allowance to skip and interpolate measurements the at pole at =180o\n-\t7 latitudes and 12 longitudes (62 grid points) for constant step size grid – Clenshaw Curtis weights integration approach, with standard deviation of 0.13 dB with the allowance to skip and interpolate measurements the at pole at =180o\n",

The idea here is to apply a fine grid around the FF beam peak direction to capture the main portion of the very directive beam while a coarse grid around the remaining portion of the sphere is applied. This is further illustrated in Figure 8.5.2-1 for a constant step-size grid with the following non-uniform TRP grid assumptions:\n-\tThe known FF beam is shown with the large grey dot. On top, the FF beam peak is assumed at (0o,0o) while the FF beam peak on the bottom is assumed at (45o,45o).\n-\tThe red grid points are within a ±20o cone centred around the NF beam peak with ==7.5o.\n-\tThe cyan grid points are outside a ±20o cone centred around the NF beam peak with ==15o.\n/\nFigure 8.5.2-1 presents a visual representation of non-uniform TRP (Transmission Ray Path) grids for a NF (Network Function) beam at two distinct angles: (0o,0o) on the top and (45o,45o) on the bottom. The grid points are color-coded to indicate their position relative to the conical NF beam peak region. The cyan points represent grid points that are situated outside the peak region, while the red points signify those located within the peak region. This visualization aids in understanding the distribution of the NF beam's coverage and the impact of the TRP grid's non-uniformity on the beam's shape and performance.Figure 8.5.2-1 illustrates the non-uniform TRP (Transmission Ray Path) grids for a NF (Network Function) beam at two distinct angles: (0o,0o) on the top and (45o,45o) on the bottom.

Grid points in cyan (red) are outside (inside) the conical NF beam peak region.\nSimulations with 2000 random permutations of the beam peak direction (rotation in , , and twist  as outlined in Clause G.1 of [3]) were performed for a FF range length of 20m; only the Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature was considered here. Table 8.5.2-1 shows the simulation results for the non-uniform measurement grids considered suitable for PC1 devices; the grid with step size of 7.5o within ±20o of the FF beam peak and step size of 15o outside ±20o of the FF beam peak is meeting the same MUs are the current measurement grid. The average number of unique grid points based on all simulations investigated is ~300 which shows a significant test time reduction compared to the current standard TRP grid with 1106 grid points while maintaining the same MU as the grid with uniform step sizes in  and .\nTable 8.5.2-1: CFFDNF TRP simulation results (using Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature) for PC1 devices (12x12 antenna configuration) using non-uniform measurement grids.\n\nThe TRP calculation is left to the system vendor as there are different approaches to determine TRP, e.g., interpolation of all results to the fine grid vs partial TRPs calculated within the cone and outside the cone.\nThe comparison of the TRP measurement grid parameters and the min. number of grid points are tabulated in Table 8.5.2-2 with angular grid spacings placed uniformly and non-uniformly in  and . Clearly, the non-uniform TRP measurement grid approach is beneficial in terms of test time reduction.\nTable 8.5.2-2: Comparison of the TRP measurement grid parameters for PC1 including potential test time improvement.\n\nThis non-uniform TRP grid approach is also applicable to the constant-density measurement grid type.\n\n\n",

The factors included in this uncertainty are the differences in path losses between the declare and the actual offsets and the difference in compensated probe pattern. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution. This MU element is applicable to CFFDNF&CFFNF methodologies with the black&white-box approach.\nAdditional background: This MU element was analysed in Clause 5.1.4.9.\nThe probe pattern is assumed to be known so that the measurement in the near field can be corrected when the probe pattern needs to be compensated. There is no direct dependence between the UE pattern and the probe pattern in near field measurements. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution. This MU element is applicable to the CFFDNF&CFFNF methodologies.\nAdditional background: This MU element is similar to the ‘A3-14 Probe pattern knowledge’ of the Near Field Test Range in TR 37.941 and should be considered 0 since the probe pattern can readily be measured.\nThe cause of this uncertainty contributor is due to the reduction of distance between the measurement antenna and the DUT from Far-Field to Near-Field. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution. This MU element is applicable to the CFFDNF, CFFNF, and CFFdeltaNF methodologies. This MU element, if a non-insignificant mean error was identified, shall also be listed under System Uncertainties.\nAdditional background: This MU element was analysed in Clauses 5.1.4.4, 5.1.4.5, 5.1.4.6, 5.1.4.8.\nFor the CFFdeltaNF methodology, there is an additional impact due to changes in antenna pattern caused by PA non-linearities, etc. which is FFS.\nAdditional background: This effect was analysed in Clause 5.1.4.8.\nThis contribution originates from calculating the Total Radiated Power based on EIRP measurements in the NF. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution. This MU element is applicable to the CFFDNF methodology.\nAdditional background: This MU element was analysed in Clause 5.1.4.4.\nThis uncertainty term is related to the coupling between the UE antenna and the measurement antenna in the near field at different distances. This uncertainty can be determined by multiple measurements of the DUT when at different distance from the probe. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution. This MU element is applicable to the CFFDNF&CFFNF methodologies.\nAdditional background: This MU element is similar to the ‘A3-15 Multiple Reflections’ MU element of the Near Field Test Range in TR 37.941 and can be assumed to be 0 but needs to be evaluated for each system separately.\nThis contribution originates from relative power measurement uncertainties at different radii when applied to the asymptotic expansion transformation. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution. This MU element is applicable to the CFFNF methodology.\nAdditional background: This MU element was analysed in Clause 5.1.4.7.\nThis contributor describes an offset uncertainty factor caused by a noise floor especially in a case of low SNR. This contributor works as a bias to measured results only to a direction to increase values and thus this shall be included in the uncertainty budget table as a systematic uncertainty. The uncertainty value can be derived by the following equation for CFFDNF and CFFdeltaNF.\n\nFor the CFFNF methodology, the asymptotic expansion approach requires EIRP measurements of two (black&white-box) or three different radii (black-box approach) and thus different SNR conditions for each EIRP measurement. The influence of noise MU therefore requires an AWGN analyses with those varying SNR conditions applied to the signals.\nThe available SNR for the CFFDNF and CFFNF methodologies must take the reduction in free-space path losses due to measurements in the near field and the reduction of relaxations into account while making sure that the available SNR is above 6dB.\nAdditional background: This MU element was analysed in Clause 5.1.4.8\n",

The x-axis represents the time in hours, while the y-axis represents the QoQZ difference in percentage. The plot shows that the QoQZ difference remains relatively stable over time, indicating that the quality of service in the network is consistently maintained.
