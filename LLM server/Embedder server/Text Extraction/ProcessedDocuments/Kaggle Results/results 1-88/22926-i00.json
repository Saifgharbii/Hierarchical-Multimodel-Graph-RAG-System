This is the case for instance with satellite access, and this could also be the case with High Altitude Platforms. Another example of extraterritorial access is where a PLMN ID is used for a local network on e.g. a ship or plane travelling in/over international waters. When considering RAN sharing on a satellite network or High-Altitude Platform, PLMN IDs as authorised by one administration in one country, could also be transmitted by a RAN another country. A further scenario could be the transmission of an international PLMN ID (as authorised by ITU according to ITU Rec E.212) over a number of countries territories.\nWhen dealing with services over international waters, aeronautical communications, or terrestrial mobile networks, the question of which requirements apply to the design and operation of the corresponding 5G system ?.\nExtraterritoriality is considered in this document as either:\nthe location of the UE and its access to the 5G network;\nthe location of the 5G network for the services to be delivered.\nGuidelines have been developed on this basis for 3GPP specified services of 5G public networks.\n",

                    "text_content": "PWS as described in [4] provides the public with alerts, warnings and critical information regarding disasters and other emergencies. The general PWS requirements in [4] are supplemented with regional specific requirements for the Earthquake and Tsunami Warning System (ETWS), the Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS), EU-ALERT, and the Korean Public Alert System (KPAS). There is also an Extended PWS, with additional requirements for UEs with no user interface or with a user interface that is incapable of displaying text-based Warning Notifications. In addition, enhancements of Public Warning System (ePWS) is intended to improve the comprehension of a Warning Notification for users with disabilities or for user who are not fluent in the language of the Warning Notifications.\nPWS and its different regional variants are generally covered by regulatory requirements (e.g. laws or other regulations). These regulatory requirements can take the form of regulations on operators to support PWS and/or in the form of regulations on devices that are sold in a particular country/region to support PWS. Issues with extraterritoriality can appear when it is not clear which of the national or regional regulatory requirements apply, e.g. in maritime or aeronautical areas. This can include that it is unclear whether PWS should be supported and/or which of the regional versions of PWS must be supported by the operator.\nWith PWS, Warning Notifications are provided by a Warning Notification Provider. In each country where PWS services are provided, there are procedures in place to determine who (e.g. which agencies or local authorities) can be a Warning Notification Provider. It is unclear whether there will be an organisation with responsibility for coordinating Warning Notifications in extraterritorial areas (e.g. maritime or aeronautical authorities). An alternative is that the network operator selects which Warning Notifications Provider(s) to use for extraterritorial areas. It is clear that a satellite operator with a satellite network covering multiple countries and/or extraterritorial areas will have to interface with multiple Warning Notification Providers.\nThe Warning Notifications likely include the following five elements:\n-\tEvent Description\n-\tArea Affected\n-\tRecommended Action\n-\tExpiration Time (with time zone)\n-\tSending Agency\nThe Warning Notification Provider will provide information determining in which area the Warning Notifications should be distributed. Based on the geographical information indicated by the Warning Notification Provider, it shall be possible for the operators to define the Notification Area based on their network configuration of the area coverage such as distribution of cells.\nWith satellite networks, it is possible that the area covered by a single cell is much larger than a cell area in the terrestrial network. This can become a problem when satellite coverage and terrestrial coverage overlap. The difference in coverage areas may cause confusion between users of different types of access that get different messages even though they are in the same location. Furthermore, satellite users may receive information that is not targeted at the area they are in. A possible way of addressing these issues is by filtering Warning Notifications on the UE based on Area Affected information within the Warning Notification and location information available on the UE.\n",

Furthermore, similar types of emergency calls may use different numbers in different countries. [5] provides the following examples:\n19\t\t\tPolice (Albania)\n100\t\tPolice and Fire Brigade (Greek cities)\n100\t\tAmbulance and Fire Brigade (Belgium)\n112\t\tPolice and Ambulance (Italy)\n112\t\tGeneral emergency call, all categories (Sweden)\n115\t\tFire Brigade (Italy)\n144\t\tAmbulance (Austria)\nAn issue with extraterritoriality may therefore be that it is not clear which emergency call numbers need to be supported. Fortunately, the UE will be able to recognize many of the emergency call numbers and translate a call to an emergency number to an emergency number request. That way on most phones you can either use 911 or 112 to make an emergency call, irrespective of where you are. Note that this is not the case for all emergency call numbers. A non-terrestrial network operators will have to take the location of the UE into account to determine which emergency call numbers apply for which purposes in case the UE has not recognised the emergency call number as a general emergency call.\nOne of the main aspects related to extraterritoriality is that emergency calls need to be routed to the correct Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). Routing to the right PSAP may be done based on the basis of UE determined location; it is assumed it is in the best interest also of the UE owner to route to the right PSAP.\nA specific issue is to determine what kind of emergency call support should be provided in extraterritorial areas (e.g. at sea outside territorial waters). Users may expect support for emergency calls in areas where there is no clear PSAP that would be able to organise an emergency response. For maritime users the GMDSS (Gross Maritime Distress Safety System) [6] in the context of SOLAS (Saving of Lives at Sea) [7] provides a communication system for emergency response. Satellite operators may provide both GMDSS and/or terrestrial emergency calls. Note that SOLAS regulations impose requirements on maritime users but does not impose regulatory requirements on satellite operators to provide GMDSS and/or emergency calls.\n",

In both the HPLMN and the VPLMN, the operator will have to provide Intercept Related Information and Content of Communication.\nRequirements universally called out in regional interception regulatory requirements are supported by the system defined in [8]. There may also be requirements unique to a specific region or country.\nIn many cases, national regulation will require that LI activity is performed entirely within a particular legal jurisdiction. Specifically information indicating the target of interception, is often not allowed to be provided to networks outside the jurisdiction of the particular country of the law enforcement agency that request interception. This may e.g. imply that the satellite ground station and/or base station and the core network all have to be in the same country as the UE, unless countries have made specific agreements. It should therefore be possible to route satellite communication to the right core network based on UE location.\nLocation Dependent Interception, (LDI) allows a 3GPP network to service multiple interception jurisdictions within its service area. Multiple law enforcement agencies with their own interception areas can be served by the 3GPP network. All the information or rules given for interception within a 3GPP network apply to interception within an Interception Area (IA) when LDI is invoked. A target may be marked in one or more different IAs within the same 3GPP network.\nDepending on national requirements, the network operator may be required to report the location of a LI target at the beginning and end of a call and/or session. It may also be a national requirement for the CSP to report the location:\n-\tduring on-going communications;\n-\tfor any mobility management event detected in the 3GPP core network which includes a target’s location change or update.\nThe location information associated with target communication reported to the law enforcement agency shall be at least location information trusted by the 3GPP network (i.e. the location information is either 3GPP network derived or verified).\nNOTE:\tCountry-specific regulations may include further requirements on location (e.g. on the frequency of reporting)\n",

In some cases there are negotiated treaties between bordering sovereign states regarding the law applicable in cross-border regions.\nThe NTN access provider and PLMN operator identify the location of the UE.

This means, in effect, retaining data according to a specific (single) set of regulations.\nData associated with the UE’s activity, such as charging records and other operational information is maintained according to international regulations (where no national regulation exists, e.g. on the high seas,) and according to sovereign state law, where this law applies.

When a non-terrestrial network uses spectrum that is subject to licensing in a specific country or region the non-terrestrial network will have to ensure it has permission from the countries or regions that are covered [10]. Note furthermore it may be possible that a non-terrestrial network cannot get the same frequency bands in all countries or regions it covers. Non-terrestrial networks will have to ensure that their use of radio spectrum in each country or region complies with the frequency license they have in that country or region and the frequency regulation of the sovereign territories which border that country or region.\nRegional/national regulators may also define exclusion areas where non-terrestrial communication is not allowed. Operators of non-terrestrial network should ensure that their networks do not provide service in exclusion areas. Further consideration of this is given in clause 7.4 when UEs are in an exclusion area and in clause 8.3 for non-terrestrial networks operation with respect to exclusion areas.\nNational regulators can assign numbers and identifiers to the network operator (e.g. Mobile Network Code, IMSI/SUPI ranges, E.164 numbers). Also the ITU can provide MNCs (with the Mobile Country Code 901) and E.164 numbers (country code 88x). Mobile and satellite networks broadcast one (or more in case of network sharing) Mobile Country Code (MCC) and Mobile Network Code (MNC) combinations. Broadcast of the MCC for one country in another country should be avoided. This may be a challenge for satellite operators that have large radio cells. An option is to use the international MCC 901. Using the international MCC is also a good choice for extra-territorial areas.\n",

                            "text_content": "This use case considers a common scenario in which the UE operates in a location not definitively within one sovereign territory. There are regulations that apply to each sovereign territory. How should the UE and network behave in this situation?\nThere are two aspects of this use case – frequency regulation and operational regulation (e.g. lawful interception.)\nWhere there are frequency emissions aspects, there are pre-existing regulations as a result of bilateral or multilateral negotiations between sovereignties. Where this is not successful, the ITU may be involved. It is therefore assumed that there are radio emissions restrictions across borders.\nExamples of border regions include:\n- \tAlong a river or natural feature defining a border\n-\tIn disputed territory\n-\tIn a border region which is too complex to entirely control all radio transmissions\nIn ITU regulations this is termed a ‘cross-border’ scenario.\nIn cross-border scenarios where there is ambiguity (or impossibility to adequately restrict emissions across the borders) there may be special arrangements, e.g. an exclusionary zone. In a specific example, there are frequencies that are of concern to Russia, so a treaty with Finland restricts use of these within a number of km of the border it shares with Russia.\nFor a UE operating in a cross-border scenario, especially with access provided by a NTN network operator, the situation is more complex and is treated below.\nFigure 7.2.1-1 illustrates the complex communication environment in ambiguous territory, where Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) access plays a crucial role. The figure depicts the integration of satellite, terrestrial, and airborne communication systems, highlighting the seamless handover between them. Key elements include the satellite constellation, ground stations, and airborne terminals, all working in tandem to provide robust and reliable connectivity in challenging terrains. The figure emphasizes the importance of NTN access in bridging the digital divide and enhancing global communication infrastructure.\nFigure 7.2.1-1 Ambiguous territory served by NTN access\nFigure 7.2.1-1 depicts an ambiguous strip of territory between two sovereign territories T1 and T2. A UE whose subscriber is ‘Amalia’ is currently in this cross-border location, between T1 and T2. The NTN network operator ‘BigSky’ provides access to Amalia’s UE. The PLMN that Amalia’s UE will register with is PLMN A. The CN of PLMN A may be in T1, T2, on the NTN platform or located in a third sovereign territory.\nAmalia turns on her UE. The UE registers with access provided by BigSky to PLMN A.\nThe access, as it straddles T1 and T2, must use frequency that is already in compliance with regulations of T1 and T2.\nPLMN A determines Amalia’s UE’s location and determines that it is an ambiguous cross-border region.\nIn T1, the regulatory regime of T1 applies (e.g. for Lawful Interception.) In T2, the regulatory regime of T2 applies. In the ambiguous zone it is not clear whose regulations applies. This requires specific consideration, as in some cases, where there are access restrictions, data retention and privacy laws, mandatory encryption of traffic, etc. the regulations may not be compatible: it may be impossible to apply both the regulations of T1 and T2 at the same time. In these cases, there must be a negotiated and harmonized set of regulations between T1 and T2.\nAmalia’s UE, according to the regulatory framework established by T1 and T2, will have set of policies that apply to its telecommunications service. The NTN operator and the PLMN A operator (which could be the same operator) will apply those regulations.\nThere are three potential ways in which the UE will behave:\n1) the UE complies with regulations of both sovereign territories (where this is in accord with regulations and the regulations are not incompatible) ), e.g. emergency call regulations in many situations apply on both sides of the border, cross country collaboration can ensure the right assistance is provided even across the border;\n2) the UE complies with the bilateral or multilateral regulations established between the territories, e.g. the HCM agreement [16] contains a multilateral regulation on cross border interference;\n3) the UE may be in a situation in which a joint (or uniform) regulation applies even though it is in a border region, e.g. the European GPDR regulation [17] is an example of a uniform regulation that applies to all countries within the European Union, including border regions between these countries.\n",

These laws apply to the passengers on board. From Article 6 \"Ships shall sail under the flag of one State only and, save in exceptional cases expressly provided for in international treaties or in these articles, shall be subject to its exclusive jurisdiction on the high seas.\"\nThis implies that passenger communication requirements of the vessel in international regions are subject to the regulations of the country of registration.\nA separate regime applies to vessels in sovereign waters and airspace. In this case, international law is more complex. The Tokyo Convention Article IV states \"A Contracting State which is not the State of registration may not interfere with an aircraft in flight in order to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over an offence committed on board except in the following cases:\na)\tthe offence has effect on the territory of such State;\nb)\tthe offence has been committed by or against a national or permanent resident of such State;\nc)\tthe offence is against the security of such State;\nd)\tthe offence consists of a  breach of any rules or regulations relating to the flight or manoeuvre of aircraft in force in such State;\ne)\tthe exercise of jurisdiction is necessary to ensure the observance of any obligation of such State under a multilateral international agreement.\"\nThus, it is entirely possible for an aircraft to impose communication regulations of the registered state while at the same time complying with the above convention. This is analogous to the situation of a vessel in national waters.\nWhile an aircraft is in sovereign airspace, regulations may apply to communications by passengers’ UEs. For example, over the United States of America, use of mobile telecommunications using a terrestrial radio access is not permitted. [13]\nA third important scenario is the ship in port or an aircraft that has landed. In this case the sovereign regulations of the territory apply. However, there are – for telecommunications especially – certain conditions that are necessary to consider. If communications equipment on board the vessel has been certified by their registered state, these certification requirements may apply to communications rather than those of the territory where they are in port. [12]\nThe relevance to satellite communication arises due to the distinct regulatory implications based not only on the location of the aircraft or vessel, but also its status (is it airborne? Is it at port?)\n",

However, there are many cases where a PLMN operator covers multiple sovereign territories with a single PLMN. In border regions, cross border coverage is unintentional. In order cases, e.g. covering small states, enclaves, island states, that are too small to have their own PLMN covering multiple sovereign territories is intentional.\n",

Both with which Mobile Country Code the non-terrestrial network can broadcast, as well as with how to determine the right network for the location of the UE.\nConsider the situation in figure, where a satellite network for country A also covers (parts of) country B and country C. Note that in some cases a satellite network may also completely cover a different country. This specifically may be the case with smaller countries (e.g. Vatican City is a different country). In many cases it will be very difficult to target satellite access to only a specific country, without spilling into or completely covering neighbouring countries.\nFigure 8.2.1-1 illustrates the satellite access infrastructure that covers multiple countries, with multiple satellites positioned at varying altitudes to provide comprehensive coverage. The figure showcases the ground stations and the terrestrial network that connects to the satellites, enabling seamless communication across the region. The infrastructure is designed to handle high traffic volumes and to provide reliable connectivity in areas where traditional terrestrial networks are not feasible. The use of multiple satellites ensures that even in the event of one satellite failure, the other satellites can continue to provide service, maintaining the network's resilience.\nFigure 8.2.1-1: Satellite access covering multiple countries.\n",

They therefore rely on a mobile network from a neighbouring country.\nAnother regulatory requirement is related to the MCC that can be used. Regulatory requirements indicate that MCC usage should be restricted to the country of the MCC represents.

For satellite networks that intentionally cover a multitude of countries, a shared MCC (e.g. 90x) is probably best. But satellite networks that focus on a specific country, but may have some cross border coverage, should be allowed to use a national MCC. A specific situation is a satellite access network that is shared among a number of operators from different countries. Here the intention of each of these network operators is to cover their own country with their PLMN ID, but the satellite access network will broadcast PLMN IDs for all the countries that it covers. This may happen especially in areas with multiple smaller countries or island regions, where country specific satellite access networks are not feasible. Agreement from the countries involved is required for cross border use of MCCs.\nNext step is to ensure that the correct network is selected, even where there may be relatively large areas where multiple MCCs are broadcast. Selecting a network in the country where the UE is located is the best way to ensure that national regulatory requirements are fulfilled.\nNOTE:\tNetworks with shared MCC will have to make their own arrangements to comply with international regulations and all the different regulations of the countries in which they provide services; this is beyond 3GPP specifications.\nAssuming localisation of the UE is supported, there are two issues with selecting a network in the country the UE is located in:\n-\tHow to determine which country the location of UE belongs to?\n-\tWho is responsible for the determination of the country?\nThe borders of a country can be expressed in a polygon of points with lines in between these points. For some borders this is easily done, but many borders are very irregular requiring very large polygons. Furthermore, country borders are sometimes disputed between different countries and are subject to changes (e.g. regions that gain independence, settlements between countries on borders or the extend of economic zones). This makes creating and maintaining a database of all country borders with sufficient accuracy a complicated and politically sensitive task.\nWhich country the UE location belongs to in can be determined by the UE or by the network. Note that the UE and the network may come to different conclusions. The network should have the definitive authority to determine if it wants to provide service for the location of the UE.\n",

Network access may simply be absent in exclusion zones by means of deployment in which base station transmitters do not cover such regions. International spectrum usage treaty compliance relies upon such placement and configuration of base stations. This approach however does not match either the constraints or the existing regulatory practices of non-terrestrial access.\nThis section considers network aspects of compliance with exclusion area policy for non-terrestrial access, given the above considerations.\n",
