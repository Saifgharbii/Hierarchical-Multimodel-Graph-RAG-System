The MB-SMF (Message-Based Short Message Service Facility) is a service that allows subscribers to manage their subscriptions to various services. The figure shows the subscriber unsubscribing from MB-SMF notifications by sending a specific command to the network operator. This process is crucial for managing network resources and ensuring efficient communication.\nFigure 5.3.2.7.1-1: Unsubscribing from MB-SMF notifications\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer shall send a DELETE request to the resource URI representing the individual subscription document resource in the MB-SMF (/subscriptions/{subscriptionID}).\n2.\tOn success, the MB-SMF shall return a \"204 No Content\" response.\n2b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.2.3.5.3.2-3 shall be returned.

The following information may be requested to be modified:\n-\tNF Instance ID of the NF Service Consumer;\n-\tNotification URI, indicating the address where to send the events notifications generated by the subscription;\n-\tEvent ID(s) of the events to which the NF service consumer requests to subscribe;\n-\tNotification Correlation ID, indicating the correlation identity to be carried in event notifications generated by the subscription.\n-\tExpiry time, indicating the time up to which the subscription is desired to be kept active and after which the subscribed events shall stop generating notifications.\nNOTE:\tA subscription can be modified e.g. when it is taken over by another SMF in the same SMF set, or before the Expiry time expires.\n\n2a.\tOn success, the MB-SMF shall return a \"200 OK\" response, with the content (ContextStatusSubscription) containing a representation of the modified subscription.\n2b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.2.3.7.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application errors listed in Table 6.2.3.7.3.1-3.\nThe ContextStatusUnSubscribe service operation shall be used to unsubscribe to notifications of events about a multicast MBS session context.\nNOTE:\tFor a location dependent MBS service, the ContextStatusUnSubscribe service operation is performed per MBS session.\nThe NF Service Consumer (e.g. SMF) shall unsubscribe to notification of events about a multicast MBS session context by using the HTTP DELETE method as shown in Figure 5.3.2.10.1-1.\nFigure 5.3.2.10.1-1 illustrates the process of deleting a subscription for a multicast MBS session context. The figure depicts the steps involved in removing a subscription from the Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) session context, which is essential for managing network resources efficiently. The figure shows the interaction between the network elements, such as the Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service Switching Center (MBS-SC), Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service Switching Node (MBS-SN), and the Subscription Management Entity (SME), as they work together to ensure the successful termination of the subscription. This process is crucial for maintaining the stability and performance of the network, as it prevents unnecessary resource usage and allows for more efficient allocation of resources.\nFigure 5.3.2.10.1-1: Deletion of a subscription for a multicast MBS session context\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer shall send a DELETE request (subscriptionId) targeting the subscription resource to be deleted.\n2a.\tOn success, the MB-SMF shall return a \"204 No Content\" response.\n2b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.2.3.7.3.2-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application errors listed in Table 6.2.3.7.3.2-3.\nThe ContextStatusNotify service operation shall be invoked by the MB-SMF to send a notification about event(s), when events about the multicast MBS session context included in the subscription occur.\nNOTE:\tFor a location dependent MBS service, the ContextStatusNotify service operation is performed per MBS session.\nIt is used in the following procedures:\n-\tMulticast session leave requested by the network or MBS session release (see clause 7.2.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.247 [14]);\n-\tMBS session activation procedure (see clause 7.2.5.2 of 3GPP TS 23.247 [14]);\n-\tMBS session deactivation procedure (see clause 7.2.5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.247 [14]); and\n-\tMulticast session update procedure (see clause 7.2.6 of 3GPP TS 23.247 [14]).\nThe MB-SMF shall notify event(s) about the multicast MBS session context by using the HTTP POST method targeting the notification URI received in the subscription as shown in Figure 5.3.2.11.1-1.\nFigure 5.3.2.11.1-1 illustrates a multicast MBS session context event, which is a crucial aspect of telecommunication network management. The figure showcases the various stages of the event, including the initiation, progression, and completion of a multicast session. Key elements such as the Multicast Session Context (MSCP), Multicast Session Control Protocol (MSCP), and the Multicast Session Description Protocol (MSDP) are depicted, highlighting their roles in managing multicast sessions efficiently. The figure emphasizes the importance of accurate and timely communication between these protocols to ensure smooth and reliable multicast session establishment and termination.\nFigure 5.3.2.11.1-1: Notification of a multicast MBS session context event\n1.\tThe MB-SMF shall send a POST request targeting the notification URI. The notification, i.e. the content of the POST request (ContextStatusNotifyReqData structure) shall contain the following information:\n-\tNotification Correlation ID, if available in the subscription;\n-\tList of event(s) which occurred;\n-\tWhen reporting a MULT_TRANS_ADD_CHANGE event:\n-\tnew multicast transport address (Low Layer SSM and C-TEID) used over the N19mb reference point;\n-\tarea session Id of the part of the location dependent MBS session for which the new multicast transport address is provided, for a location dependent MBS session;\n-\tWhen reporting a QOS_INFO event:\n-\tlist of MBS QoS flows to add, modify and/or release (in the qosFlowsAddModRequestList IE and/or qosFlowsRelRequestList) for the multicast MBS session.\n-\tWhen reporting a SECURITY_INFO event:\n-\tif security protection is applied, the multicast session security context containing MBS Service Key (MSK), MBS Traffic Key (MTK) and the corresponding key IDs.\n2a.\tOn success, a \"204 No Content\" response shall be returned.\n2b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.2.5.3.3.1-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application errors listed in Table 6.2.5.3.3.1-2.\n\n",
