In general cells are combined along with AWGN, so the signal and noise seen by the UE may be determined by more than one cell.\nSince several cells may contribute towards the overall power applied to the UE, a number of test system uncertainties affect the signal and noise seen by the UE. The aim of the superposition method is to vary each controllable parameter of the test system separately, and to establish its effect on the critical parameters as seen by the UE receiver. The superposition principle then allows the effect of each test system uncertainty to be added, to calculate the overall effect.\nThe contributing test system uncertainties shall form a minimum set for the superposition principle to be applicable.\n",

The effect of each controllable parameter of the test system on the critical parameters as seen by the UE receiver shall therefore be established. As a consequence of the sensitivity scaling factors not necessarily being unity, the test system uncertainties cannot be directly applied as test tolerances to the critical parameters as seen by the UE.\nEXAMPLE:\tIn many of the tests described, the Ês / Iot is one of the critical parameters at the UE. Scaling factors are used to model the sensitivity of the Ês / Iot to each test system uncertainty. When the scaling factors have been determined, the superposition principle then allows the effect of each test system uncertainty to be added, to give the overall variability in the critical parameters as seen at the UE.\nThere are often constraints on several parameters at the UE. The aim of the sensitivity analysis, together with the acceptable test system uncertainties, is to ensure that the variability in each of these parameters is controlled within the limits necessary for the specification to apply. The test has then been conducted under valid conditions.\n",

In the UE radio reception conformance tests covered by the present document, the Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be adjusted to within the specified range, with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values.\nThe method given in the present document combines the acceptable uncertainties of the test system, to give the overall variability in the critical parameters as seen at the UE. Since the process does not add any new uncertainties, the method of combination should be chosen to maintain the same tolerance interval for the combined uncertainty as is already specified for the contributing test system uncertainties.\nThe basic principle for combining uncertainties is in accordance with ETR 273-1-2 [3]. In summary, the process requires 3 steps:\na)\tExpress the value of each contributing uncertainty as a one standard deviation figure, from knowledge of its numeric value and its distribution.\nb)\tCombine all the one standard deviation figures as root-sum-squares, to give the one standard deviation value for the combined uncertainty.\nc)\tExpand the combined uncertainty by a coverage factor, according to the tolerance interval required.\nProvided that the contributing uncertainties have already been obtained using this method, using a coverage factor of 2, further stages of combination can be achieved by performing step b) alone, since steps a) and c) simply divide by 2 and multiply by 2 respectively.\nThe root-sum-squares method is therefore used to maintain the same tolerance interval for the combined uncertainty as is already specified for the contributing test system uncertainties. In some cases where correlation between contributing uncertainties has an adverse effect, the method is modified in accordance with clause 4.4.5 of the present document.\nIn each analysis, the uncertainties are assumed to be uncorrelated, and are added result root-sum-square unless otherwise stated.\nThe combination of uncertainties is performed using dB values for simplicity. It has been shown that using dB uncertainty values gives a slightly worse combined uncertainty result than using linear values for the uncertainties. The analysis method therefore errs on the safe side.\n",

The aim is therefore to minimise uncertainty, subject to a number of practical constraints:\na)\tA vendor’s test system should be reproducible in the required quantities.\nb)\tA choice of test systems should be available from different vendors.\nc)\tThe uncertainties should allow reasonable freedom of test system implementation\nd)\tThe test system can be run automatically\ne)\tThe test system may include several radio access technologies\nf)\tIt should be possible to maintain calibration of deployed test systems over reasonable spans of time and environmental conditions\nIn practice therefore within 3GPP the acceptable uncertainty of the test system is the smallest value that can be agreed between the test system vendors represented, consistent with the above constraints. The uncertainty will not therefore be as low as could be achieved, for example, by a national standards laboratory.\n",
