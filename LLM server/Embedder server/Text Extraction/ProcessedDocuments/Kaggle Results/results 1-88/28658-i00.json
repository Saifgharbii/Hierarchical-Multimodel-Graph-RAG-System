It does not define their syntax and encoding.\nThe E-UTRAN NRM IRP comprises a set of specifications defining Requirements, a protocol neutral Information Service and one or more Solution Set(s).\nThe present document specifies the protocol neutral E-UTRAN NRM IRP: Information Service (IS). It reuses relevant parts of the Generic NRM IRP: IS in 3GPP TS 28.622 [6], either by direct reuse or sub-classing, and in addition to that defines E-UTRAN specific Information Object Classes.\nIn order to access the information defined by this NRM, an Interface IRP such as the \"Basic CM IRP\" is needed (3GPP TS 32.602 [7]). However, which Interface IRP is applicable is outside the scope of the present document.\nThe present document also specifies the ng-eNB network resource information that can be communicated among NG-RAN management system, including management of MR-DC operations which ng-eNB is involved in.\n",

The reason using NRNetwork and EUtraNetwork is for a clean separation of NR external entities and frequency and LTE external entities and frequency.\n\nThe given telecommunication figure illustrates the relationship between different entities within a network, specifically focusing on the association between ENBFunctions and RNFunctions, as well as the management of these functions by IRPAgent instances. The figure emphasizes the presence of two types of associations: ServesRN and ServesExtRN, which dictate whether the ENBFunction and RNFunction instances are managed by the same or different IRPAgents. This diagram is crucial for understanding the network's organization and the roles of various components in managing and coordinating network functions.\nNOTE 1:\tIf an instance of the ServesRN association is present, then a corresponding instance of ServedByEGC must be present. In this case, the ENBFunction and RNFunction instances are under the management scope of the same IRPAgent. \nIf an instance of the ServesExtRN association is present, then a corresponding instance of ServedByExtEGC must be present.
