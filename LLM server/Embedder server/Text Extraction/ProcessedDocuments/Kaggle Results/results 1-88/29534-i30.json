This procedure also enables the subscription to notifications about subsequent changes on the service area coverage result of changes of the provisioned Service Area Restrictions (e.g. due to changes in the subscribed Service Area Restrictions).\nTo request to the PCF to provide a notification when a service area coverage (which may be same or different service area coverage from the service area coverage provided by the NF service consumer) has been determined (and the related policy for Service Area Restrictions is applied) based on the request or when a service area coverage cannot be determined and, additionally, when the service area coverage subsequently changes within the AM Policy Association, the NF service consumer shall provide in the HTTP POST request message described in clause 4.2.2.2 the \"evSubsc\" attribute including an event entry within the \"events\" attribute with the \"event\" attribute set to \"SAC_CH\" and the \"notifMethod\" set to \"ON_EVENT_DETECTION\" (or omitted).\nThe PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.2.2.\nWhen the service area coverage change event is met in the PCF, the PCF notifies to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.7.4.\n",

In these cases, to avoid the PCF keeping stale subscription information, the NF service consumer needs to ensure that the concerned requested policy exists together with the event subscription, i.e. the event subscription is removed when the related policy is removed.\nUpon the reception of the HTTP PUT request from the NF service consumer, the PCF shall decide whether the received HTTP PUT request is accepted.\nIf the HTTP PUT request from the NF service consumer is not accepted, the PCF shall indicate in the response to HTTP PUT request the cause for the rejection as specified in clause 5.7.\nIf the PCF determines the received HTTP PUT request needs to be redirected, the PCF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\nIf the PCF accepted the HTTP PUT request to create a subscription to events, the PCF shall create the \"AM Policy Events Subscription\" sub-resource and shall send the HTTP response message to the NF service consumer as shown in figure 4.2.5.2-1, step 2.

This figure highlights the steps involved in creating a new context for event subscriptions, emphasizing the importance of efficient event management in modern communication systems. The figure showcases the interaction between the network elements, such as the Network Management Entity (NME) and the Application Event Manager (AEM), in handling event subscriptions without the need for an existing context. This process is crucial for ensuring smooth operation and scalability in large-scale communication networks.\nFigure 4.2.5.3-1: Subscription to events without an existing AF application AM context\nWhen an NF service consumer (e.g. 5G DDNMF) decides to create a subscription to one or more event(s), and the NF service consumer is not providing Access and Mobility related service information and the \"Individual application AM context\" resource does not exist, the NF service consumer shall invoke the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Subscribe service operation to create an \"Individual application AM context\" resource and the corresponding \"AM Policy Events Subscription\" sub-resource by sending an HTTP POST request to the resource URI representing the \"Application AM contexts\" collection resource of the PCF, as shown in figure 4.2.5.3-1, step 1.\nThe NF service consumer shall include in the AppAmContextData data type in the content of the HTTP POST request a partial representation of the \"Individual Application AM Context\" resource, which shall include:\n-\tthe notification URI where the PCF shall request the termination of the application AM context to the NF service consumer,  encoded as \"termNotifUri\" attribute;\n-\tthe SUPI encoded as \"supi\" attribute; and\n-\tthe \"evSubsc\" attribute to subscribe to notifications of access and mobility policy changes events.

For each subscribed event, the AmEventData data type shall include the event identifier in the \"event\" attribute and may include the description of the event reporting mode as specified in clause 4.2.5.2.\nThe event(s) subscription data is provisioned in the \"AM Policy Events Subscription\" sub-resource.\nIf the PCF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP POST request due to the internal PCF error or due to the error in the HTTP POST request, the PCF shall send the HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.7.\nOtherwise, the PCF shall perform the association of the AF request to one and only one AM policy association or UE policy association. If the PCF fails in executing the binding with the AM policy association or UE policy association, the PCF shall reject the HTTP POST request with an HTTP \"500 Internal Server Error\" response and may include the \"cause\" attribute set to \"POLICY_ASSOCIATION_NOT_AVAILABLE\".\nNOTE 1:\tIn this release of the specification whether the AF request is associated to an AM policy association or to a UE policy association is determined per specific event, e.g., a subscription to PDUID changes implies the binding to a UE policy association.\nIf the PCF created an \"Individual Application AM Context\" resource and the corresponding \"AM Policy Events Subscription\" sub-resource, the PCF shall send to the NF service consumer a \"201 Created\" response to the HTTP POST request, as shown in figure 4.2.5.3-1, step 2.

The Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Unsubscribe service operation also enables an NF service consumers to remove an existing subscription to event(s) without an existing AF application AM context.\nSuch subscription to events shall be removed:\n-\tby invoking the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Unsubscribe service operation for an existing AF application AM context, as described in clause 4.2.6.2; or\n-\twithin the AF application AM context modification procedure by invoking the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Update service operation, as described in clause 4.2.3; or\n-\twithin the AF application AM context termination procedure by invoking the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation, as described in clause 4.2.4.\n-\tby invoking the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Unsubscribe service operation when there is no existing Individual application AM context, as described in clause 4.2.6.3.\nThe following procedures using the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Unsubscribe service operation are supported:\n-\tUnsubscription to events, Access and Mobility related service information exists.\n-\tUnsubscription to events, Access and Mobility related service information does not exist.\nThis procedure is used to unsubscribe to all subscribed events when the NF service consumer previously provided access and mobility related service information for the existing AF application AM context, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [14]. As result of this procedure, the \"AM Policy Events Subscription\" sub-resource is removed but the \"Individual application AM context\" remains with the access and mobility related service information.\nFigure 4.2.6.2-1 illustrates the procedure to unsubscribe from AM Policy Authorization event(s) using the HTTP DELETE method.\nFigure 4.2.6.2-1 illustrates the process of removing events subscription information using HTTP DELETE. The figure depicts a client initiating the DELETE request to a server, which then processes the request and removes the corresponding event subscription data. The diagram highlights the role of the client and server in this operation, emphasizing the importance of secure and efficient communication for event management systems.\nFigure 4.2.6.2-1: Removal of events subscription information using HTTP DELETE\nWhen the NF service consumer decides to unsubscribe to all subscribed event(s) for an existing AF application AM context, and the NF service consumer previously provided access and mobility service information to the PCF, the NF service consumer shall invoke the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Unsubscribe service operation by sending an HTTP DELETE request message to the resource URI representing the concerned \"AM Policy Events Subscription\" sub-resource in the PCF, as shown in figure 4.2.6.2-1, step 1.\nUpon the reception of the HTTP DELETE request message from the NF service consumer, the PCF shall decide whether the received HTTP request message is accepted.\nIf the HTTP DELETE request message from the NF service consumer is accepted, the PCF shall delete the \"AM Policy Events Subscription\" sub-resource and shall send to the NF service consumer a HTTP \"204 No Content\" response message.\nIf the HTTP DELETE request message from the NF service consumer is rejected, the PCF shall indicate in the HTTP response message the cause for the rejection as specified in clause 5.7.\nIf the PCF determines the received HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, the PCF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\nThis procedure is used by the NF service consumer to unsubscribe to all subscribed event(s) when the AF application AM context does not contain access and mobility related service information, i.e. only contains the \"supi\" attribute, the SBI handling specific properties, i.e. the \"suppFeat\" attribute and the \"termNotifUri\", together with the subscription information encoded in the \"evSubsc\" attribute. As a result of this procedure, the \"AM Policy Events Subscription\" sub-resource and the parent \"Individual application AM context\" resource are both removed.\nThe procedure to unsubscribe from AM Policy Authorization events when the AF application AM context does not contain access and mobility related service information is the same as the procedure to delete the AF application AM context defined in clause 4.2.4.2.\n",

This event is part of the 5G network's management and orchestration process, which ensures efficient resource allocation and optimal network performance. The figure shows the interaction between the Network Management System (NMS) and the User Equipment (UE), highlighting the exchange of information and commands necessary for managing the network's resources. The diagram emphasizes the importance of timely and accurate context event notifications in maintaining the network's stability and responsiveness to user demands.\nFigure 4.2.7.2-1: Notification about AF application AM context event\nWhen the PCF determines that the event for the existing AF application AM context, to which the NF service consumer has subscribed to, occurred, the PCF shall invoke the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation by sending the HTTP POST request (as shown in figure 4.2.7.2-1, step 1) to the NF service consumer using the callback URI received in the subscription creation (or modification), as specified in clauses 4.2.2.2, 4.2.3.2 and 4.2.5.2. The PCF shall provide in the body of the HTTP POST request the \"AmEventsNotification\" data type including:\n-\tthe AM Policy Events Subscription resource identifier related with the notification in the \"appAmContextId\" attribute; and\n-\tthe list of the reported events in the \"repEvents\" attribute. For each reported event, the \"AmEventNotification\" data type may include additional event information.\nThe notification of other specific events using the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Notify request is described in the related clauses.\nUpon the reception of the HTTP POST request from the PCF indicating that the subscribed event occurred, the NF service consumer shall acknowledge that request by sending an HTTP response message with the corresponding status code.\nIf the HTTP POST request from the PCF is not accepted, the NF service consumer shall indicate in the response to HTTP POST request the cause for the rejection as specified in clause 5.7.\nIf the HTTP POST request from the PCF is accepted, the NF service consumer shall acknowledge the receipt of the event notification with a \"204 No Content\" response to HTTP POST request, as shown in figure 4.2.7.2-1, step 2.\nIf the NF service consumer determines the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\nThis procedure is invoked by the PCF to notify the NF service consumer that the AF application AM context is no longer valid, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [14].\nFigure 4.2.7.3-1 illustrates the notification about AF application AM context termination.\nFigure 4.2.7.3-1 illustrates a notification about the application of the Address Family (AF) application AM context termination. The figure depicts the process of terminating an Address Family application context, which is a crucial step in network management. The diagram shows the various components involved in the termination process, including the AF application, the AM context, and the network elements that interact with these components. The figure highlights the importance of proper management of Address Family applications to ensure efficient and reliable network operation.\nFigure 4.2.7.3-1: Notification about AF application AM context termination\nWhen the PCF determines that the AF application AM context is no longer valid, the PCF shall invoke the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation by sending the HTTP POST request (as shown in figure 4.2.7.3-1, step 1) using the callback URI received in the \"Individual application AM context\" resource creation, as specified in clause 4.2.2.2. The PCF shall provide in the body of the HTTP POST request the \"AmTerminationInfo\" data type including:\n-\tthe Individual application AM context resource identifier related to the termination notification within the \"appAmContextId\" attribute; and\n-\tthe AF application AM context termination cause within the \"termCause\" attribute encoded using of the \"AmTerminationCause\" data type, indicating the termination cause.\nUpon the reception of the HTTP POST request from the PCF requesting the AF application AM context termination, the NF service consumer shall acknowledge that request by sending an HTTP response message with the corresponding status code.\nIf the HTTP POST request from the PCF is not accepted, the NF service consumer shall indicate in the response to HTTP POST request the cause for the rejection as specified in clause 5.7.\nIf the HTTP POST request from the PCF is accepted, the NF service consumer shall acknowledge the receipt of the AF application AM context termination request with a \"204 No Content\" response (as shown in figure 4.2.7.3-1, step 2) and shall invoke the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation to the PCF as described in clause 4.2.4.\nIf the NF service consumer determines the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\nWhen the PCF becomes aware that the request received from the NF service consumer to change the service area coverage is performed, it shall inform the NF service consumer accordingly if the NF service consumer has previously subscribed to the \"SAC_CH\" event as described in clauses 4.2.2.3 and 4.2.3.3.\nThe PCF shall notify the NF service consumer by including the AmEventsNotification data type in the body of the HTTP POST request as described in clause 4.2.7.2. The PCF shall include within an entry of the \"repEvents\" attribute:\n-\tthe \"event\" attribute set to \"SAC_CH\" in the \"event\" attribute;\n-\tthe applied service area coverage (same or different service area coverage from the service area coverage provided by the NF service consumer) in the \"appliedCov\" attribute.\nWhen the result of the execution of the request of service area coverage is that the service is allowed in one or more of the requested Tracking Areas in the serving network where the UE is camping, the \"appliedCov\" attribute shall encode within the \"tacList\" attribute the list of NF consumer provided Tracking Area codes where the requested service shall be allowed and within the \"servingNetwork\" attribute the serving network where the UE is camping.\nWhen the result of the execution of the request of service area coverage change is that the service is restricted in the whole NF requested service area coverage, the \"appliedCov\" attribute shall encode an empty array within the \"tacList\" attribute.\nNOTE:\tThe actual service area coverage for the UE might be larger than the one reported within \"appliedCov\" attribute. The \"appliedCov\" attribute provides to the NF consumer feedback about where the service is allowed in relation to the NF consumer provided service area coverage.\nWhen the NF service consumer indicated that the notification method is \"ON_EVENT_DETECTION\" (or omitted it) during the subscription, the subscription to this event is kept in the PCF until the NF service consumer terminates the subscription as described in clause 4.2.3.2 or 4.2.6.2. The NF service consumer shall be notified  of subsequent service area coverage changes (i.e., changes in the applied service area coverage, which may indicate e.g. no service area coverage is allowed) as specified in bullets above without requiring a new subscription, both, when the service area coverage change is triggered by the NF service consumer and/or triggered by other events (e.g. based on PCF internal policies and/or changes in the subscribed service area restrictions), and as long as the requested service area coverage requirements exist (e.g, they have not expired).\nUpon receipt of the HTTP POST request from the PCF, the NF service consumer shall acknowledge the request by sending a \"204 No Content\" response as described in clause 4.2.7.2.\nWhen the PCF allocates a new PDUID (ProSe Discovery UE ID) for the UE 5G ProSe Policy of a SUPI, the PCF shall inform the NF service consumer that previously subscribed as described in clause 4.2.5.4.\nThe PCF shall notify the NF service consumer by including the AmEventsNotification data type in the body of the HTTP POST request as described in clause 4.2.7.2, which shall include within an entry of the \"repEvents\" attribute:\n-\tthe \"PDUID_CH\" event within the \"event\" attribute; and\n-\tthe \"pduidInfo\" attribute, with the allocated PDUID within the \"pduid\" attribute and its validity timer within the \"expiry\" attribute.\nWhen the NF service consumer receives the notification in the HTTP POST request, it shall acknowledge the request by sending a \"204 No Content\" response to the PCF as specified in clause 4.2.7.2.\n",
