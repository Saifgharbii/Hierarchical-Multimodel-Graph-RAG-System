The figure outlines the progression of states, including the initial Idle State, through Handover, to the Active State. It also details the inter-RAT procedures, such as the transition between LTE and UMTS, and the handover between different cells. The figure is essential for understanding the complex mobility management within the E-UTRA/EPC system, ensuring seamless connectivity for mobile users across different networks.\nFigure 4.2.1-1: E-UTRA/EPC states and inter RAT mobility procedures, 3GPP\nFigure 4.2.1-2 illustrates the mobility support between E-UTRA/EPC, CDMA2000 1xRTT and CDMA2000 HRPD. The details of the CDMA2000 state models are out of the scope of this specification.\nFigure 4.2.1-2 illustrates the mobility procedures between E-UTRA/EPC and CDMA2000 networks, showcasing the seamless handover process that ensures uninterrupted connectivity for mobile users. The figure depicts the interaction between the E-UTRA/EPC and CDMA2000 networks, highlighting the exchange of signaling information and the synchronization of radio resources. The figure emphasizes the importance of efficient handover procedures in maintaining high-quality communication services for mobile users across different network technologies.\nFigure 4.2.1-2: Mobility procedures between E-UTRA/EPC and CDMA2000\nFigure 4.2.1-3 not only provides an overview of the RRC states in E-UTRA/5GC, but also illustrates the mobility support between E-UTRA/5GC, UTRAN and GERAN.\nFigure 4.2.1-3 illustrates the E-UTRA/5GC states and inter RAT mobility procedures, as defined by 3GPP. The figure outlines the various states a user equipment (UE) can be in, such as the Home Location Register (HLR), Serving Mobile Exchange (S-GW), and Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI). It also details the inter-RAT mobility procedures, including the transition between 3GPP and Non-3GPP systems.

The figure depicts the synchronization between the two systems, highlighting the efficient exchange of information to maintain a high level of service quality. Key components include the E-UTRA/5GC network, CDMA2000 network, and the handover process, which is crucial for maintaining a high level of service quality and user experience.\nFigure 4.2.1-4: Mobility procedures between E-UTRA/5GC and CDMA2000\nFigure 4.2.1-5 illustrates the mobility procedures supported between E-UTRA/5GC and E-UTRA/EPC.\nFigure 4.2.1-5 illustrates the mobility procedures between E-UTRA/5GC and E-UTRA/EPS C, showcasing the seamless handover process that ensures continuous connectivity for mobile users. The figure depicts the synchronization between the eNodeB and the UE, highlighting the importance of timing accuracy in 5G networks. It also emphasizes the role of the gNB and the evolved Packet Core (EPC) in managing the handover, ensuring a fast and efficient transition between cells.\"\nFigure 4.2.1-5: Mobility procedures between E-UTRA/5GC and E-UTRA/EPC\nFigure 4.2.1-6 illustrates the mobility procedures supported between E-UTRA/EPC, E-UTRA/5GC and NR.\nFigure 4.2.1 -6 illustrates the mobility procedures between E-UTRA/EPC, E-UTRA/5GC, and NR, detailing the handover process and signaling mechanisms. The figure showcases the seamless transition of a user between different network domains, ensuring continuous connectivity and high-quality service. Key components include the evolved Node B (eNB), Home Location Register (HLR), and Mobility Management Entity (MME), which work together to maintain optimal network performance and user experience.\nFigure 4.2.1-6:\tMobility procedures between E-UTRA/EPC, E-UTRA/5GC and NR\nThe inter-RAT handover procedure(s) supports the case of signalling, conversational services, non-conversational services and combinations of these.\nIn addition to the state transitions shown in figures above, there is support for connection release with redirection information from E-UTRA RRC_CONNECTED to GERAN, UTRAN, CDMA2000 (HRPD Idle/ 1xRTT Dormant mode) and NR. A UE in RRC_INACTIVE enters RRC_IDLE when it enters another RAT or switches to another CN type.\nFor NB-IoT, mobility between E-UTRA and UTRAN, GERAN and between E-UTRA and CDMA2000 1xRTT and CDMA2000 HRPD is not supported at AS level and hence only the E-UTRA states depicted in Figure 4.2.1-1 are applicable.\n",

                            "text_content": "\"Signalling Radio Bearers\" (SRBs) are defined as Radio Bearers (RB) that are used only for the transmission of RRC and NAS messages. More specifically, the following SRBs are defined:\n-\tSRB0 is for RRC messages using the CCCH logical channel;\n-\tSRB1 is for RRC messages (which may include a piggybacked NAS message) as well as for NAS messages prior to the establishment of SRB2, all using DCCH logical channel;\n-\tFor NB-IoT, SRB1bis is for RRC messages (which may include a piggybacked NAS message) as well as for NAS messages prior to the activation of security, all using DCCH logical channel;\n-\tSRB2 is for RRC messages which include logged measurement information as well as for NAS messages and messages which include IAB-DU specific F1-C related information, all using DCCH logical channel. SRB2 has a lower-priority than SRB1 and is always configured by E-UTRAN after security activation. SRB2 is not applicable for NB-IoT;\n-\tSRB4 is for RRC messages which include application layer measurement reporting information, all using DCCH logical channel. SRB4 can only be configured by E-UTRAN after security activation. SRB4 is not applicable for NB-IoT.\nIn downlink piggybacking of NAS messages is used only for one dependant (i.e. with joint success/ failure) procedure: bearer establishment/ modification/ release. In uplink NAS message piggybacking is used only for transferring the initial NAS message during connection setup.\nNOTE 1:\tThe NAS messages transferred via SRB2 are also contained in RRC messages, which however do not include any RRC protocol control information.\nOnce security is activated, all RRC messages on SRB1, SRB2 and SRB4, including those containing NAS or non-3GPP messages, are integrity protected and ciphered by PDCP. NAS independently applies integrity protection and ciphering to the NAS messages.\nFor a UE configured with DC, all RRC messages, regardless of the SRB used and both in downlink and uplink, are transferred via the MCG. In case of EN-DC, after connection establishment NR PDCP may be configured for both SRB1 and SRB2 and if so, these SRBs may be configured as split SRB. In case of NGEN-DC and NE-DC, NR PDCP is always configured. For a split SRB, the UE receives RRC messages via both MCG and NR SCG i.e. handles out of order and duplicate PDUs as specified in TS 38.323 [83]. For a split SRB, the network configures via which cell group(s) the UE sends uplink RRC messages.\nNOTE 2:\tIn case of (NG)EN-DC, SRB3 may be configured for the transfer of some NR RRC messages between UE and SgNB via the NR radio interface, see TS 38.331 [82].\nAn SRB can be configured with PDCP duplication, either by two logical channels within the same CG (CA duplication) or by two logical channels each within a different CG (DC duplication).\n",

                            "text_content": "System information is divided into the MasterInformationBlock (MIB) and a number of SystemInformationBlocks (SIBs) and SystemInformationBlockPos (posSIBs). The MIB includes a limited number of most essential and most frequently transmitted parameters that are needed to acquire other information from the cell, and is transmitted on BCH. SIBs other than SystemInformationBlockType1 and posSIBs are carried in SystemInformation (SI) messages. The mapping of SIBs and posSIBs to SI messages is flexibly configurable by schedulingInfoList and posSchedulingInfoList, respectively, included in SystemInformationBlockType1, with restrictions that: each SIB is contained only in a single SI message and each SIB and posSIB is contained at most once in that SI message; only SIBs and posSIBs having the same scheduling requirement (periodicity) can be mapped to the same SI message; SystemInformationBlockType2 is always mapped to the SI message that corresponds to the first entry in the list of SI messages in schedulingInfoList. There may be multiple SI messages transmitted with the same periodicity. SystemInformationBlockType1 and all SI messages are transmitted on DL-SCH.\nThe Bandwidth reduced Low Complexity (BL) UEs and UEs in Coverage Enhancement (CE) apply Bandwidth Reduced (BR) version of the SIB, posSIB or SI messages. A UE considers itself in enhanced coverage as specified in TS 36.304 [4]. In this and subsequent clauses, anything applicable for a particular SIB, posSIB or SI message equally applies to the corresponding BR version unless explicitly stated otherwise.\nFor NB-IoT, a reduced set of system information block with similar functionality but different content is defined; the UE applies the NB-IoT (NB) version of the MIB and the SIBs. These are denoted MasterInformationBlock-NB, MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB and SystemInformationBlockTypeX-NB in this specification. All other system information blocks (without NB suffix) are not applicable to NB-IoT; this is not further stated in the corresponding text.\nNOTE 1:\tThe physical layer imposes a limit to the maximum size a SIB can take. When DCI format 1C is used the maximum allowed by the physical layer is 1736 bits (217 bytes) while for format 1A the limit is 2216 bits (277 bytes), see TS 36.212 [22] and TS 36.213 [23]. For BL UEs and UEs in CE, the maximum SIB and SI message size is 936 bits, see TS 36.213 [23]. For NB-IoT, the maximum SIB and SI message size is 680 bits, see TS 36.213 [23].\nIn addition to broadcasting, E-UTRAN may provide SystemInformationBlockType1, SystemInformationBlockType2 and/or SystemInformationBlockType31, including the same parameter values, via dedicated signalling i.e., within an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message.\nThe UE applies the system information acquisition and change monitoring procedures for the PCell, except when being a BL UE or a UE in CE or a NB-IoT UE in RRC_CONNECTED mode while T311 is not running. For an SCell, E-UTRAN provides, via dedicated signalling, all system information relevant for operation in RRC_CONNECTED when adding the SCell. However, a UE that is configured with DC shall aquire the MasterInformationBlock of the PSCell but use it only to determine the SFN timing of the SCG, which may be different from the MCG. Upon change of the relevant system information of a configured SCell, E-UTRAN releases and subsequently adds the concerned SCell, which may be done with a single RRCConnectionReconfiguration message. If the UE is receiving or interested to receive an MBMS service in a cell, the UE shall apply the system information acquisition and change monitoring procedure to acquire parameters relevant for MBMS operation and apply the parameters acquired from system information only for MBMS operation for this cell.\nNOTE 2:\tE-UTRAN may configure via dedicated signalling different parameter values than the ones broadcast in the concerned SCell.\nIn MBMS-dedicated cell, non-MBSFN subframes are used for providing MasterInformationBlock-MBMS (MIB-MBMS) and SystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS. SIBs other than SystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS are carried in SystemInformation-MBMS message which is also provided on non-MBSFN subframes.\nAn RN configured with an RN subframe configuration does not need to apply the system information acquisition and change monitoring procedures. Upon change of any system information relevant to an RN, E-UTRAN provides the system information blocks containing the relevant system information to an RN configured with an RN subframe configuration via dedicated signalling using the RNReconfiguration message. For RNs configured with an RN subframe configuration, the system information contained in this dedicated signalling replaces any corresponding stored system information and takes precedence over any corresponding system information acquired through the system information acquisition procedure. The dedicated system information remains valid until overridden.\nNOTE 3:\tE-UTRAN may configure an RN, via dedicated signalling, with different parameter values than the ones broadcast in the concerned cell.\nThe MIB uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 40 ms and repetitions made within 40 ms. The first transmission of the MIB is scheduled in subframe #0 of radio frames for which the SFN mod 4 = 0, and repetitions are scheduled in subframe #0 of all other radio frames. For TDD/FDD system with a bandwidth larger than 1.4 MHz that supports BL UEs or UEs in CE, MIB transmission may additionally be repeated in subframe#0 of the same radio frame, and in subframe#9 of the previous radio frame for FDD and subframe #5 of the same radio frame for TDD.\nNOTE:\tThe UE may assume the scheduling of MIB repetitions does not change. E-UTRAN may indicate in MobilityControlInfo whether optional MIB repetitions are enabled or not.\nThe MIB-MBMS uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 160 ms and repetitions made within 160 ms. The first transmission of the MIB-MBMS is scheduled in subframe #0 of radio frames for which the SFN mod 16 = 0, and repetitions are scheduled in subframe #0 of all other radio frames for which the SFN mod 4 = 0.\nThe SystemInformationBlockType1 uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 80 ms and repetitions made within 80 ms. The first transmission of SystemInformationBlockType1 is scheduled in subframe #5 of radio frames for which the SFN mod 8 = 0, and repetitions are scheduled in subframe #5 of all other radio frames for which SFN mod 2 = 0.\nFor BL UEs or UEs in CE, MIB is applied which may be provided with additional repetitions, while for SIB1 and further SI messages, separate messages are used which are scheduled independently and with content that may differ. The separate instance of SIB1 is named as SystemInformationBlockType1-BR. The SystemInformationBlockType1-BR uses a schedule with a periodicity of 80ms. TBS for SystemInformationBlockType1-BR and the repetitions made within 80ms are indicated via schedulingInfoSIB1-BR in MIB or optionally in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including the MobilityControlInfo.\nThe SystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS uses fixed schedule with a periodicity of 160 ms. The first transmission of SystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS is scheduled in subframe #0 of radio frames for which the SFN mod 16 = 0, and repetitions are scheduled in subframe #0 of all other radio frames for which SFN mod 8 = 0. Additionally, the SystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS and other system informations blocks may be scheduled in additional non-MBSFN subframes indicated in MasterInformationBlock-MBMS.\nThe SI messages are transmitted within periodically occurring time domain windows (referred to as SI-windows) using dynamic scheduling. Each SI message is associated with a SI-window and the SI-windows of different SI messages do not overlap. That is, within one SI-window only the corresponding SI is transmitted. The length of the SI-window is common for all SI messages, and is configurable. Within the SI-window, the corresponding SI message can be transmitted a number of times in any subframe other than MBSFN subframes, uplink subframes in TDD, and subframe #5 of radio frames for which SFN mod 2 = 0. The UE acquires the detailed time-domain scheduling (and other information, e.g. frequency-domain scheduling, used transport format) from decoding SI-RNTI on PDCCH (see TS 36.321 [6]). For a BL UE or a UE in CE, the detailed time/frequency domain scheduling information for the SI messages is provided in SystemInformationBlockType1-BR.\nFor UEs other than BL UE or UEs in CE SI-RNTI is used to address SystemInformationBlockType1 as well as all SI messages. On MBMS-dedicated cell and on FeMBMS/Unicast-mixed cell, SI-RNTI with value in accordance with TS 36.321 [6] is used to address all SI messages whereas SI-RNTI with value in accordance with TS 36.321 [6] is used to address SystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS.\nSystemInformationBlockType1 configures the SI-window length and the transmission periodicity for the SI messages.\nThe MasterInformationBlock-NB (MIB-NB) uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 640 ms and repetitions made within 640 ms. The first transmission of the MIB-NB is scheduled in subframe #0 of radio frames for which the SFN mod 64 = 0 and repetitions are scheduled in subframe #0 of all other radio frames. The transmissions are arranged in 8 independently decodable blocks of 80 ms duration.\nThe MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB (MIB-TDD-NB) uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 640 ms and repetitions made within 640 ms. The first transmission of the MIB-TDD-NB is scheduled in subframe #9 of radio frames for which the SFN mod 64 = 0 and repetitions are scheduled in subframe #9 of all other radio frames. The transmissions are arranged in 8 independently decodable blocks of 80 ms duration.\nThe SystemInformationBlockType1-NB (SIB1-NB) uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 2560 ms.\nFor FDD, SIB1-NB transmission occurs in subframe #4 of every other frame in 16 continuous frames. The starting frame for the first transmission of the SIB1-NB is derived from the cell PCID and the number of repetitions within the 2560 ms period and repetitions are made, equally spaced, within the 2560 ms period (see TS 36.213 [23]). TBS for SystemInformationBlockType1-NB and the repetitions made within the 2560 ms are indicated by schedulingInfoSIB1 field in the MIB-NB. If additionalTransmissionSIB1 is set to TRUE in the MIB-NB, additional SIB1-NB transmission occurs in subframe #3 of the same radio frames where SIB1-NB transmission occurs with the same number of repetitions.\nFor TDD, SIB1-NB transmission on the anchor carrier occurs in either subframe #0 or subframe #4 of every other frame in 16 continuous frames and SIB1-NB transmission on a non-anchor carrier occurs in subframe #0 and next in subframe #5 of every other frame in 16 continuous frames. The starting frame for the first transmission of the SIB1-NB is derived from the cell PCID and the number of repetitions within the 2560 ms period and repetitions are made, equally spaced, within the 2560 ms period (see TS 36.213 [23]). TBS for SystemInformationBlockType1-NB, the repetitions made within the 2560 ms, and the subframe index (#0 or #4) are indicated by schedulingInfoSIB1 field in the MIB-TDD-NB.\nThe SI messages are transmitted within periodically occurring time domain windows (referred to as SI-windows) using scheduling information provided in SystemInformationBlockType1-NB. Each SI message is associated with a SI-window and the SI-windows of different SI messages do not overlap. That is, within one SI-window only the corresponding SI is transmitted. The length of the SI-window is common for all SI messages, and is configurable.\nWithin the SI-window, the corresponding SI message can be transmitted a number of times over 2 or 8 consecutive NB-IoT downlink subframes depending on TBS.The UE acquires the detailed time/frequency domain scheduling information and other information, e.g. used transport format for the SI messages from schedulingInfoList field in SystemInformationBlockType1-NB. The UE is not required to accumulate several SI messages in parallel but may need to accumulate a SI message across multiple SI windows, depending on coverage condition.\nSystemInformationBlockType1-NB configures the SI-window length and the transmission periodicity for all SI messages.\nChange of system information (other than for ETWS, CMAS, EAB, UAC, and satellite assistance information parameters except for discontinuous coverage scenarios and for NB-IoT, other than for AB parameters and satellite assistance information parameters except for discontinuous coverage scenarios) only occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the concept of a modification period is used. System information may be transmitted a number of times with the same content within a modification period, as defined by its scheduling. The modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod m= 0, where m is the number of radio frames comprising the modification period. The modification period is configured by system information. If H-SFN is provided in SystemInformationBlockType1-BR, modification period boundaries for BL UEs and UEs in CE are defined by SFN values for which (H-SFN * 1024 + SFN) mod m=0. For NB-IoT, H-SFN is always provided and the modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for which (H-SFN * 1024 + SFN) mod m=0.\nTo enable system information update notification for RRC_IDLE UEs configured to use a DRX cycle longer than the modification period, an eDRX acquisition period is defined. The boundaries of the eDRX acquisition period are determined by H-SFN values for which H-SFN mod 256 =0. For NB-IoT, the boundaries of the eDRX acquisition period are determined by H-SFN values for which H-SFN mod 1024 =0.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the UE in RRC_IDLE is configured to use extended DRX cycle, e.g., in the order of several minutes or longer, in case the eNB is reset the UE SFN may not be synchronized to the new eNB SFN. The UE is expected to recover, e.g., acquire MIB within a reasonable time, to avoid repeated paging failures.\nNOTE 1a:\tFor the UE in RRC_INACTIVE, the idle mode extended DRX cycle, if configured, is used to compare with the modification period.\nWhen the network changes (some of the) system information, it first notifies the UEs about this change, i.e. this may be done throughout a modification period. In the next modification period, the network transmits the updated system information. During a modification period where ETWS or CMAS transmission is started or stopped, the SI messages carrying the SIBs scheduled in schedulingInfoListExt and/or SI messages carrying the posSIBs scheduled in posSchedulingInfoList may change, so the UE might not be able to successfully receive those SIBs and/or posSIBs in the remainder of the current modification period and next modification period according to the scheduling information received prior to the change. These general principles are illustrated in figure 5.2.1.3-1, in which different colours indicate different system information. Upon receiving a change notification, the UE not configured to use a DRX cycle that is longer than the modification period acquires the new system information immediately from the start of the next modification period. Upon receiving a change notification applicable to eDRX, a UE in RRC_IDLE configured to use a DRX cycle that is longer than the modification period acquires the updated system information immediately from the start of the next eDRX acquisition period. The UE applies the previously acquired system information until the UE acquires the new system information. The possible boundaries of modification for SystemInformationBlockType1-BR are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod 512 = 0 except for notification of ETWS/CMAS for which the eNB may change SystemInformationBlockType1-BR content at any time. For NB-IoT, the possible boundaries of modification for SystemInformationBlockType1-NB are defined by SFN values for which (H-SFN * 1024 + SFN) mod 4096 = 0.\n\nFigure 5.2.1.3-1 illustrates the process of change of system information in a telecommunication network. The figure depicts the various components involved, including the system information manager (SIM), system information database (SID), and system information requestor (SIR). The flow of information is shown from the SIM to the SID and then to the SIR, highlighting the secure and efficient transmission of system updates. The figure emphasizes the importance of real-time system information management for maintaining network performance and security.\nFigure 5.2.1.3-1: Change of system Information\nThe Paging message is used to inform UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED about a system information change. If the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED or is not configured to use a DRX cycle longer than the modification period in RRC_IDLE, and receives a Paging message including the systemInfoModification, it knows that the system information will change at the next modification period boundary. A UE in RRC_IDLE that is configured to use a DRX cycle longer than the modification period, and receives in an eDRX acquisition period at least one Paging message including the systemInfoModification-eDRX, shall acquire the updated system information at the next eDRX acquisition period boundary. Although the UE may be informed about changes in system information, no further details are provided e.g. regarding which system information will change, except if systemInfoValueTagSI is received by BL UEs or UEs in CE.\nIn RRC_CONNECTED, BL UEs or UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs are not required to acquire system information except when T311 is running, or upon handover where the UE is only required to acquire the MasterInformationBlock in the target PCell, or for UEs in CE to receive ETWS/CMAS information, or upon expiry of T317 where the UE is only required to acquire the SystemInformationBlockType31 (SystemInformationBlockType31-NB in NB-IoT). In RRC_IDLE, E-UTRAN may notify BL UEs or UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs about SI update, and except for NB-IoT, ETWS and CMAS notification, EAB modification and UAC modification, using Direct Indication information, as specified in 6.6 (or 6.7.5 in NB-IoT) and TS 36.212 [22].\nNOTE 2:\tUpon system information change essential for BL UEs, UEs in CE, or NB-IoT UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, E-UTRAN may initiate connection release.\nNOTE 3:\tWhen acquiring SIB31(-NB) in RRC_CONNECTED, UE may assume that the scheduling is unchanged.\nSystemInformationBlockType1 (or MasterInformationBlock-NB/ MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB in NB-IoT) includes a value tag systemInfoValueTag, that indicates if a change has occurred in the SI messages. UEs may use systemInfoValueTag, e.g. upon return from out of coverage, to verify if the previously stored SI messages are still valid. MasterInformationBlock and RSS (if transmitted, see TS 36.211 [21]) may indicate using systemInfoUnchanged-BR that a change has not occurred in the SIB1-BR and SI messages of the current cell at least over the SI validity time, and the BL UEs or UEs in CE may use the systemInfoUnchanged-BR, e.g. upon return from out of coverage, to verify if the previously stored SIB1-BR and SI messages are still valid. Additionally, for other than BL UEs or UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs, the UE considers stored system information to be invalid after 3 hours from the moment it was successfully confirmed as valid, unless specified otherwise. BL UE or UE in CE considers stored system information to be invalid after 24 hours from the moment it was successfully confirmed as valid, unless the UE is configured by parameter si-ValidityTime to consider stored system information to be invalid 3 hours after validity confirmation. NB-IoT UE considers stored system information to be invalid after 24 hours from the moment it was successfully confirmed as valid. If a BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE in RRC_CONNECTED state considers the stored system information invalid, the UE shall continue using the stored system information while in RRC_CONNECTED state in the serving cell.\nFor BL UEs or UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs, the change of specific SI message can additionally be indicated by a SI message specific value tag systemInfoValueTagSI. If systemInfoValueTag included in the SystemInformationBlockType1-BR (or MasterInformationBlock-NB/ MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB in NB-IoT) is different from the one of the stored system information and if systemInfoValueTagSI is included in the SystemInformationBlockType1-BR (or SystemInformationBlockType1-NB in NB-IoT) for a specific SI message and is different from the stored one, the UE shall consider this specific SI message to be invalid. If only systemInfoValueTag is included and is different from the stored one, the BL UE or UE in CE should consider any stored system information except SystemInformationBlockType10, SystemInformationBlockType11, SystemInformationBlockType12, SystemInformationBlockType14, SystemInformationBlockType25, SystemInformationBlockType31 and SystemInformationBlockType33 to be invalid; the NB-IoT UE should consider any stored system information except SystemInformationBlockType14-NB, SystemInformationBlockType31-NB and SystemInformationBlockType33-NB to be invalid.\nOn MBMS-dedicated cell and on FeMBMS/Unicast-mixed cell, the change of system information and ETWS/CMAS notification is indicated by using Direct Indication FeMBMS defined in 6.6a. The modification periodicity follows MCCH modification periodicity as defined in 5.8.1.3.\nE-UTRAN may not update systemInfoValueTag upon change of some system information e.g. ETWS information, CMAS information, RLOS indication (i.e., rlos-Enabled), regularly changing parameters like time information (SystemInformationBlockType8, SystemInformationBlockType16, hyperSFN-MSB in SystemInformationBlockType1-NB), EAB and AB parameters, UAC parameters, positioning system information blocks, or satellite assistance information. Similarly, E-UTRAN may not include the systemInfoModification within the Paging message upon change of some system information.\nNOTE 4:\tUE connected to NTN is expected to re-acquire SIB32(-NB) based on its own decision regardless of systemInfoValueTag change.\nThe UE that is not configured to use a DRX cycle longer than the modification period verifies that stored system information remains valid by either checking systemInfoValueTag in SystemInformationBlockType1 (or MasterInformationBlock-NB/ MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB in NB-IoT) after the modification period boundary, or attempting to find the systemInfoModification indication at least modificationPeriodCoeff times during the modification period in case no paging is received, in every modification period. If no paging message is received by the UE during a modification period, the UE may assume that no change of system information will occur at the next modification period boundary. If UE in RRC_CONNECTED, during a modification period, receives one paging message, it may deduce from the presence/ absence of systemInfoModification whether a change of system information other than ETWS information, CMAS information, EAB and UAC parameters will occur in the next modification period or not.\nWhen the RRC_IDLE UE is configured with a DRX cycle that is longer than the modification period, and at least one modification period boundary has passed since the UE last verified validity of stored system information, the UE verifies that stored system information remains valid by checking the systemInfoValueTag before establishing or resuming an RRC connection.\nETWS and/or CMAS capable UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, other than BL UEs and UEs in CE, shall attempt to read paging at least once every defaultPagingCycle to check whether ETWS and/or CMAS notification is present or not.\nETWS primary notification and/ or ETWS secondary notification can occur at any point in time. The Paging message is used to inform ETWS capable UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs not in CE in RRC_CONNECTED about presence of an ETWS primary notification and/ or ETWS secondary notification. For UEs in CE supporting reception of ETWS indication in RRC_CONNECTED mode, control channels associated with the shared data channel are used to inform the UE about the presence of an ETWS primary notification and/or ETWS secondary notification. If the UE receives a Paging message or control channels associated with the shared data channel including the etws-Indication, it shall start receiving the ETWS primary notification and/ or ETWS secondary notification according to schedulingInfoList contained in SystemInformationBlockType1. If the UE receives Paging message or control channels associated with the shared data channel including the etws-Indication while it is acquiring ETWS notification(s), the UE shall continue acquiring ETWS notification(s) based on the previously acquired schedulingInfoList until it re-acquires schedulingInfoList in SystemInformationBlockType1.\nNOTE:\tThe UE is not required to periodically check schedulingInfoList contained in SystemInformationBlockType1, but Paging message including the etws-Indication triggers the UE to re-acquire schedulingInfoList contained in SystemInformationBlockType1 for scheduling changes for SystemInformationBlockType10 and SystemInformationBlockType11. The UE may or may not receive a Paging message including the etws-Indication and/or systemInfoModification when ETWS is no longer scheduled.\nETWS primary notification is contained in SystemInformationBlockType10 and ETWS secondary notification is contained in SystemInformationBlockType11. Segmentation can be applied for the delivery of a secondary notification. The segmentation is fixed for transmission of a given secondary notification within a cell (i.e. the same segment size for a given segment with the same messageIdentifier, serialNumber and warningMessageSegmentNumber). An ETWS secondary notification corresponds to a single CB data IE as defined according to TS 23.041 [37].\nCMAS notification can occur at any point in time. The Paging message is used to inform CMAS capable UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs not in CE in RRC_CONNECTED about presence of one or more CMAS notifications. For UEs in CE supporting reception of CMAS indication in RRC_CONNECTED mode, control channels associated with the shared data channel are used to inform the UE about the presence of one or more CMAS notifications. If the UE receives a Paging message including the cmas-Indication, it shall start receiving the CMAS notifications according to schedulingInfoList contained in SystemInformationBlockType1. If the UE receives Paging message or control channels associated with the shared data channel including the cmas-Indication while it is acquiring CMAS notification(s), the UE shall continue acquiring CMAS notification(s) based on the previously acquired schedulingInfoList until it re-acquires schedulingInfoList in SystemInformationBlockType1.\nNOTE:\tThe UE is not required to periodically check schedulingInfoList contained in SystemInformationBlockType1, but Paging message including the cmas-Indication triggers the UE to re-acquire schedulingInfoList contained in SystemInformationBlockType1 for scheduling changes for SystemInformationBlockType12. The UE may or may not receive a Paging message including the cmas-Indication and/or systemInfoModification when SystemInformationBlockType12 is no longer scheduled.\nCMAS notification is contained in SystemInformationBlockType12. A CMAS notification corresponds to a single CB data IE as defined according to TS 23.041 [37]. A CMAS notification may optionally have associated warning area coordinates. Segmentation can be applied for the delivery of a CMAS notification and, if present, the associated warning area coordinates. The segmentation is fixed for transmission of a given CMAS notification and, if present, any associated warning area coordinates within a cell (i.e. the same segment size for a given segment with the same messageIdentifier, serialNumber and warningMessageSegmentNumber). E-UTRAN does not interleave transmissions of CMAS notifications, i.e. all segments of a given CMAS notification transmission are transmitted prior to those of another CMAS notification.\nChange of EAB parameters can occur at any point in time. The EAB parameters are contained in SystemInformationBlockType14. The Paging message is used to inform EAB capable UEs in RRC_IDLE about a change of EAB parameters or that SystemInformationBlockType14 is no longer scheduled. If the UE receives a Paging message including the eab-ParamModification, it shall acquire SystemInformationBlockType14 according to schedulingInfoList contained in SystemInformationBlockType1. If the UE receives a Paging message including the eab-ParamModification while it is acquiring SystemInformationBlockType14, the UE shall continue acquiring SystemInformationBlockType14 based on the previously acquired schedulingInfoList until it re-acquires schedulingInfoList in SystemInformationBlockType1.\nNOTE:\tThe EAB capable UE is not expected to periodically check schedulingInfoList contained in SystemInformationBlockType1.\nChange of Access Barring (AB) parameters can occur at any point in time. The AB parameters are contained in SystemInformationBlockType14-NB. Update of the AB parameters does not impact the systemInfoValueTag in the MasterInformationBlock-NB/ MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB or the systemInfoValueTagSI in SystemInformationBlockType1-NB.\nIf SystemInformationBlockType14-NB is scheduled, a NB-IoT UE connected to EPC is required to acquire MasterInformationBlock-NB/ MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB before initiating RRC connection establishment / resume for all access causes except mobile terminating calls to check ab-Enabled indication. If access barring is enabled the UE shall not initiate the RRC connection establishment / resume for all access causes except mobile terminating calls until the UE has acquired the SystemInformationBlockType14-NB.\nIf SystemInformationBlockType14-NB is scheduled, a NB-IoT UE connected to 5GC is required to acquire MasterInformationBlock-NB/ MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB before initiating RRC connection establishment / resume / re-establishment to check ab-Enabled-5GC indication. If access barring is enabled the UE shall not initiate the RRC connection establishment / resume / re-establishment until the UE has acquired the SystemInformationBlockType14-NB.\nChange of UAC parameters can occur at any point in time. The UAC parameters are contained in SystemInformationBlockType25. The Paging message is used to inform BL UEs or UEs in CE in RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_IDLE connected to 5GC about a change of UAC parameters or that SystemInformationBlockType25 is no longer scheduled. If the UE receives a Paging message including the uac-ParamModification, it shall acquire SystemInformationBlockType25 according to schedulingInfoList contained in SystemInformationBlockType1. If the UE receives a Paging message including the uac-ParamModification while it is acquiring SystemInformationBlockType25, the UE shall continue acquiring SystemInformationBlockType25 based on the previously acquired schedulingInfoList until it re-acquires schedulingInfoList in SystemInformationBlockType1.\nNOTE:\tThe BL UE or UE in CE is not expected to periodically check schedulingInfoList contained in SystemInformationBlockType1.\n",

The figure depicts various components involved in the process, including the system information acquisition module, which is responsible for collecting data from different parts of the system. The data is then transmitted to the central processing unit, which analyzes and stores the information for future reference. The figure also shows the flow of data between different modules, highlighting the importance of communication and coordination in ensuring the smooth operation of the system. Overall, the figure provides a comprehensive overview of the system's information acquisition process, emphasizing the need for efficient and accurate data collection to maintain the system's functionality.\nFigure 5.2.2.1-1: System information acquisition, normal\nThe UE applies the system information acquisition procedure to acquire the AS- and NAS- and positioning-system information that is broadcasted by the E-UTRAN. The procedure applies to UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED.\nFor BL UE, UE in CE and NB-IoT UE, specific conditions apply, as specified below.\nThe UE shall apply the system information acquisition procedure upon selecting (e.g. upon power on) and upon re-selecting a cell, after handover completion, after entering E-UTRA from another RAT, upon return from out of coverage, upon receiving a notification that the system information has changed, upon receiving an indication about the presence of an ETWS notification, upon receiving an indication about the presence of a CMAS notification, upon receiving a notification that the EAB parameters have changed, upon receiving a request from CDMA2000 upper layers, upon receiving a request from positioning upper layers, upon receiving a notification that the UAC parameters have changed and upon exceeding the maximum validity duration. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the procedural specification, the system information acquisition procedure overwrites any stored system information, i.e. delta configuration is not applicable for system information and the UE discontinues using a field if it is absent in system information unless explicitly specified otherwise.\nIn RRC_CONNECTED, BL UEs and UEs in CE are required to acquire system information when T311 is running or upon handover where the UE is only required to acquire the MasterInformationBlock in the target PCell.\nNOTE:\tUpon handover, E-UTRAN provides system information required by the UE in RRC_CONNECTED except MIB with RRC signalling, i.e. systemInformationBlockType1Dedicated and mobilityControlInfo.\nThe UE shall:\n1>\tensure having a valid version, as defined below, of (at least) the following system information, also referred to as the 'required' system information:\n2>\tif in RRC_IDLE:\n3>\tif the UE is a NB-IoT UE:\n4>\tthe MasterInformationBlock-NB/ MasterInformationBlock-TDD-NB and SystemInformationBlockType1-NB as well as SystemInformationBlockType2-NB through SystemInformationBlockType5-NB, SystemInformationBlockType22-NB;\n3>\telse:\n4>\tthe MasterInformationBlock and SystemInformationBlockType1 (or SystemInformationBlockType1-BR depending on whether the UE is a BL UE or the UE in CE) as well as SystemInformationBlockType2 through SystemInformationBlockType8 and SystemInformationBlockType24 (depending on support of the concerned RATs), SystemInformationBlockType17 (depending on support of RAN-assisted WLAN interworking when the UE is connected to EPC), SystemInformationBlockType25 (depending on support of E-UTRA/5GC), SystemInformationBlockType29 (only for BL UE or the UE in CE depending on support of resource reservation), SystemInformationBlockType21, SystemInformationBlockType26 (if UE is capable of V2X sidelink communication and is configured by upper layers to receive or transmit V2X sidelink communication), and SystemInformationBlockType28 (if UE is capable of NR sidelink communication and is configured by upper layers to receive or transmit NR sidelink communication), SystemInformationBlockType30 (if UE is configured by upper layers to report disaster roaming related information);\n3>\tif initiating a RRC connection establishment/resume procedure;

                            "text_content": "RRC connection establishment involves the establishment of SRB1. Except for EDT and transmission using PUR, E-UTRAN completes RRC connection establishment prior to completing the establishment of the S1 connection, i.e. prior to receiving the UE context information from the EPC. Consequently, AS security is not activated during the initial phase of the RRC connection. During this initial phase of the RRC connection, the E-UTRAN may configure the UE to perform measurement reporting, but the UE only sends the corresponding measurement reports after successful security activation. However, the UE only accepts a handover message when security has been activated.\nNOTE 1:\tIn case the serving frequency broadcasts multiple overlapping bands, E-UTRAN can only configure measurements after having obtained the UE capabilities, as the measurement configuration needs to be set according to the band selected by the UE.\nUpon receiving the UE context from the EPC, E-UTRAN activates security (both ciphering and integrity protection) using the initial security activation procedure. The RRC messages to activate security (command and successful response) are integrity protected, while ciphering is started only after completion of the procedure. That is, the response to the message used to activate security is not ciphered, while the subsequent messages (e.g. used to establish SRB2 and DRBs) are both integrity protected and ciphered.\nAfter having initiated the initial security activation procedure, E-UTRAN initiates the establishment of SRB2 and DRBs, i.e. E-UTRAN may do this prior to receiving the confirmation of the initial security activation from the UE. In any case, E-UTRAN will apply both ciphering and integrity protection for the RRC connection reconfiguration messages used to establish SRB2 and DRBs. E-UTRAN should release the RRC connection if the initial security activation and/ or the radio bearer establishment fails (i.e. security activation and DRB establishment are triggered by a joint S1-procedure, which does not support partial success).\nFor SRB2 and DRBs, security is always activated from the start, i.e. the E-UTRAN does not establish these bearers prior to activating security.\nFor some radio configuration fields, a critical extension has been defined. A switch from the original version of the field to the critically extended version is allowed using any connection reconfiguration. The UE reverts to the original version of some critically extended fields upon handover and re-establishment as specified elsewhere in this specification. Otherwise, switching a field from the critically extended version to the original version is only possible using the handover or re-establishment procedure with the full configuration option. This also applies for fields that are critically extended within a release (i.e. original and extended version defined in same release).\nAfter having initiated the initial security activation procedure, E-UTRAN may configure a UE that supports CA, with one or more SCells in addition to the PCell that was initially configured during connection establishment. The PCell is used to provide the security inputs and upper layer system information (i.e. the NAS mobility information e.g. TAI). SCells are used to provide additional downlink and optionally uplink radio resources. When not configured with any kind of DC, all SCells the UE is configured with, if any, are part of the MCG.\nWhen configured with DC, some of the SCells are part of a SCG. In this case, user data carried by a DRB may either be transferred via MCG (i.e. MCG-DRB), via SCG (SCG-DRB) or via both MCG and SCG in DL while E-UTRAN configures the CG used in UL (split DRB). An RRC connection reconfiguration message may be used to change the DRB type from MCG-DRB to SCG-DRB or to split DRB, as well as from SCG-DRB or split DRB to MCG-DRB.\nDC employs SCG change, which is a synchronous SCG reconfiguration procedure (i.e. involving RA to the PSCell) including reset/ re-establishment of layer 2 and, if SCG DRBs are configured, refresh of security. The procedure is used in a number of different scenarios e.g. SCG establishment, PSCell change, Key refresh, change of DRB type. The UE performs the SCG change related actions upon receiving an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including mobilityControlInfoSCG, see 5.3.10.10.\nIn case of MR-DC, the cells of one CG use another RAT, namely NR. The configuration of an NR CG is specified in TS 38.331 [82]. When configured with MR-DC, user data carried by a DRB may either be transferred via MCG, via NR SCG or via both MCG and NR SCG. Also RRC signalling carried by a SRB may either be transferred via MCG or via both MCG and NR SCG. When DRBs and SRBs are configured with transmission via both MCG and SCG, duplication may be used in both DL and UL.\nWhen connected to EPC, change to NR PDCP or vice versa can be done for both SRBs and DRBs as follows. For DRBs, it can be performed using an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message either with or without the mobilityControlInfo (handover) by release and addition of the concerned RB. For SRBs, it can be performed using an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message with the mobilityControlInfo (handover) by release and addition of the concerned PDCP entity. For SRBs and DRBs, it can also be performed using the full configuration option. The same RRCConnectionReconfiguration message may be used to make changes regarding the CG(s) used for transmission. For SRB1, change from E-UTRA PDCP to NR PDCP type may, before initial security activation, also be performed using an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message not including the mobilityControlInfo.\nIn case of (NG)EN-DC, there are three types of NR SCG reconfigurations:\n-\tReconfiguration with sync and key change i.e. a procedure involving RA to the PSCell, including NR MAC reset, re-establishment of NR RLC and NR PDCP and refresh of NR SCG security; and\n-\tReconfiguration with sync but without key change i.e. a procedure involving RA to the PSCell, including NR MAC reset and NR RLC re-establishment and PDCP data recovery (for AM DRB); and\n-\tRegular NR SCG reconfiguration neither involving refresh of NR SCG security, nor RA to the PSCell, NR MAC reset or NR RLC re-establishment;\nThe network is only required to use the NR SCG reconfiguration with sync and key change in case the NR SCG security key changes (i.e. handover, change of SNs, S-KgNB refresh). Further details are specified in NR RRC TS 38.331 [82].\nNOTE 2:\tIn case of MR-DC, E-UTRA RRC configuration parameters should only affect E-UTRA operation. E.g., s-Measure only affects measurements configured by parameters defined in this specification. Should an E-UTRA RRC configuration change require a change of NR RRC configuration, the network should indicate such NR change by NR RRC signalling. E.g. a specific indication is used to trigger RLC re-establishment upon reconfigurations changing the CG(s) used for transmission (in DL or UL) that otherwise would only involve NR RRC signalling.\nIn this release of the specification, change between DC and MR-DC as well as change between DC and E-UTRA configured with SN terminated DRB without SCG are not supported (i.e. neither the direct reconfiguration nor specific measurement events). Likewise, the direct transition between (NG)EN-DC and NR DC or NE-DC is not supported in this release of the specification.\nThe release of the RRC connection normally is initiated by E-UTRAN. The procedure may be used to re-direct the UE to an E-UTRA frequency or an inter-RAT carrier frequency. Only in exceptional cases, as specified within this specification, TS 36.300 [9], TS 36.304 [4] or TS 24.301 [35], may the UE abort the RRC connection, i.e. move to RRC_IDLE without notifying E-UTRAN.\nThe suspension of the RRC connection is initiated by E-UTRA/EPC or E-UTRA/5GC. When the RRC connection is suspended, the UE stores the UE AS context and the resumeIdentity (EPC) or I-RNTI (5GC), and transitions to RRC_IDLE state. The RRC message to suspend the RRC connection is integrity protected and ciphered. Suspension can only be performed when at least 1 DRB is successfully established.\nThe resumption of a suspended RRC connection is initiated by upper layers when the UE has a stored UE AS context, RRC connection resume is permitted by E-UTRA/EPC or E-UTRA/5GC and the UE needs to transit from RRC_IDLE state to RRC_CONNECTED state. When the RRC connection is resumed, RRC configures the UE according to the RRC connection resume procedure based on the stored UE AS context and any RRC configuration received from E-UTRA/EPC or E-UTRA/5GC. The RRC connection resume procedure re-activates security and re-establishes SRB(s) and DRB(s). The request to resume the RRC connection includes the resumeIdentity (EPC) or I-RNTI (5GC). The request is not ciphered, but protected with a message authentication code.\nIn response to a request to resume the RRC connection, E-UTRA/EPC or E-UTRA/5GC may resume the suspended RRC connection, reject the request to resume and instruct the UE to either keep or discard the stored context, or setup a new RRC connection.\nIn case of CP-EDT or CP transmission using PUR, the data are appended in the RRCEarlyDataRequest and RRCEarlyDataComplete messages, if available, and sent over SRB0. In case of UP-EDT or UP transmission using PUR, security is re-activated prior to transmission of RRC message using the nextHopChainingCount provided in the RRCConnectionRelease message with suspend indication during the preceding suspend procedure and the radio bearers are re-established. The uplink data are transmitted ciphered on DTCH multiplexed with the RRCConnectionResumeRequest message on CCCH. In the downlink, the data, if available, are transmitted on DTCH multiplexed with the RRCConnectionRelease message on DCCH. In response to a request for EDT or transmission using PUR, E-UTRA/EPC or E-UTRA/5GC may also choose to establish or resume the RRC connection.\nA UE in RRC_CONNECTED enters RRC_INACTIVE when the network indicates RRC connection suspension in RRCConnectionRelease message. When entering RRC_INACTIVE, the UE stores the UE Inactive AS context and any RRC configuration received from the network.\nThe resumption of an RRC connection from RRC_INACTIVE is initiated by upper layers when the UE needs to transit from RRC_INACTIVE state to RRC_CONNECTED state or by RRC layer for, e.g. RNAU or reception of RAN paging. When the RRC connection is resumed, network configures the UE according to the RRC connection resume procedure based on the stored UE Inactive AS context and any RRC configuration received from the network. The RRC connection resume procedure re-activates security and re-establishes SRB(s) and DRB(s).\nIn response to a request to resume the RRC connection from RRC_INACTIVE, the network may resume the suspended RRC connection and UE enters to RRC_CONNECTED, or reject the request to resume using RRC message without security protection and send UE to RRC_INACTIVE with wait time, or directly re-suspend the RRC connection and send UE to RRC_INACTIVE, or directly release the RRC connection and send UE to RRC_IDLE, or instruct the UE to initiate NAS level recovery.\nNOTE 3:\tIn case the configurations for V2X sidelink communication are acquired from NR, the configurations for V2X sidelink communication in SystemInformationBlockType21, SystemInformationBlockType26, SL-V2X-ConfigDedicated within RRCConnectionReconfiguration used in this clause can be provided by SIB13, SIB14, sl-ConfigDedicatedEUTRA within RRCReconfiguration as specified in TS 38.331 [82], respectively.\nAS security comprises of the integrity protection of RRC signalling (SRBs) as well as the ciphering of RRC signalling (SRBs) and user data (DRBs). Integrity protection is optionally supported for DRBs when using NR PDCP configured with nr-RadioBearerConfig1 or nr-RadioBearerConfig2.\nRRC handles the configuration of the security parameters which are part of the AS configuration: the integrity protection algorithm, the ciphering algorithm and two parameters, namely the keyChangeIndicator and the nextHopChainingCount, which are used by the UE to determine the AS security keys upon handover, connection re-establishment, connection resume, UP-EDT and/ or UP transmission using PUR.\nThe integrity protection algorithm is common for signalling radio bearers SRB1, SRB2 and SRB4. The integrity protection algorithm signalled in nr-RadioBearerConfig1/ nr-RadioBearerConfig2 for the DRBs configured to apply integrity protection of user data and keyToUse set to master as defined in TS 38.331 [82] is the same as the one signalled in securityAlgorithmConfig. When configured with MCG only, the ciphering algorithm is common for all radio bearers (i.e. SRB1, SRB2, SRB4 and DRBs). Neither integrity protection nor ciphering applies for SRB0.\nRRC integrity and ciphering are always activated together, i.e. in one message/ procedure. RRC integrity and ciphering are never de-activated. However, it is possible to switch to a 'NULL' ciphering algorithm (eea0).\nThe 'NULL' integrity protection algorithm (eia0) is used only for the UE in limited service mode, as specified in TS 33.401 [32]. In case the 'NULL' integrity protection algorithm is used, 'NULL' ciphering algorithm is also used.\nNOTE 1:\tLower layers discard RRC messages for which the integrity check has failed and indicate the integrity verification check failure to RRC.\nThe AS applies different security keys: one for the integrity protection of RRC signalling (KRRCint), one for the ciphering of RRC signalling (KRRCenc) and one for the ciphering of user data (KUPenc). For the UE capable of user plane integrity protection when it is connected to E-UTRA/EPC (TS 33.401 [32]), the AS applies a security key for integrity protection of user data (KUPint) for the DRBs that are configured to apply integrity protection of user data. All AS keys are derived from the KeNB key. The KeNB is based on the KASME key for E-UTRA/EPC, or KAMF for E-UTRA/5GC, which is handled by upper layers.\nUpon connection establishment new AS keys are derived. No AS-parameters are exchanged to serve as inputs for the derivation of the new AS keys at connection establishment.\nThe integrity and ciphering of the RRC message used to perform handover is based on the security configuration used prior to the handover and is performed by the source eNB.\nThe integrity and ciphering algorithms can only be changed upon handover. The AS keys (KeNB, KRRCint, KRRCenc, KUPenc and KUPint) change upon every handover, connection re-establishment, connection resume, UP-EDT and UP transmission using PUR. The keyChangeIndicator is used upon handover and indicates whether the UE should use the keys associated with the KASME key for E-UTRA/EPC, or KAMF for E-UTRA/5GC, taken into use with the latest successful NAS SMC procedure. The nextHopChainingCount parameter is used upon handover, connection re-establishment, connection resume, UP-EDT and UP transmission using PUR by the UE when deriving the new KeNB that is used to generate KRRCint, KRRCenc and KUPenc (see TS 33.401 [32]). An intra cell handover procedure may be used to change the keys in RRC_CONNECTED.\nFor each radio bearer an independent counter (COUNT, as specified in TS 36.323 [8] for E-UTRA/EPC, and TS 38.323 [83] for E-UTRA/5GC) is maintained for each direction. For each DRB, the COUNT is used as input for ciphering. For each SRB, the COUNT is used as input for both ciphering and integrity protection. It is not allowed to use the same COUNT value more than once for a given security key. At connection resume the COUNT is reset. As specified in TS 33.401 clause 7.2.9.1 [32], the eNB is responsible for avoiding reuse of the COUNT with the same RB identity and with the same KeNB, e.g. due to the transfer of large volumes of data, release and establishment of new RBs, and multiple termination point changes for RLC-UM bearers, multiple termination point changes for RLC-AM bearer with SN terminated PDCP re-establishment (COUNT reset) due to SN only full configuration whilst the key stream inputs (i.e. bearer ID, security key) at MN have not been updated. In order to avoid such re-use, the eNB may e.g. use different RB identities for successive RB establishments, trigger an intra cell handover or by triggering a transition from RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE and then back to RRC_CONNECTED.\nIn order to limit the signalling overhead, individual messages/ packets include a short sequence number (PDCP SN, as specified in TS 36.323 [8] for E-UTRA/EPC, and TS 38.323 [83] for E-UTRA/5GC). In addition, an overflow counter mechanism is used: the hyper frame number (TX_HFN and RX_HFN, as specified in TS 36.323 [8] for E-UTRA/EPC, and HFN as specified in TS 38.323 [83] for E-UTRA/5GC). The HFN needs to be synchronized between the UE and the eNB.\nFor each SRB, the value provided by RRC to lower layers to derive the 5-bit BEARER parameter used as input for ciphering and for integrity protection is the value of the corresponding srb-Identity with the MSBs padded with zeroes.\nWith E-UTRA/5GC for a UE not capable of NGEN-DC, the same ciphering algorithm signalled at SMC or handover is used for all radio bearers. Likewise, the same integrity algorithm signalled at SMC or handover is used for all SRBs.\nIn case of DC, a separate KeNB is used for SCG-DRBs (S-KeNB). This key is derived from the key used for the MCG (KeNB) and an SCG counter that is used to ensure freshness. To refresh the S-KeNB e.g. when the COUNT will wrap around, E-UTRAN employs an SCG change, i.e. an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including mobilityControlInfoSCG. When performing handover, while at least one SCG-DRB remains configured, both KeNB and S-KeNB are refreshed. In such case E-UTRAN performs handover with SCG change i.e. an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including both mobilityControlInfo and mobilityControlInfoSCG. The ciphering algorithm is common for all radio bearers within a CG but may be different between MCG and SCG. The ciphering algorithm for SCG DRBs can only be changed upon SCG change.\nIn case of (NG)EN-DC or of SN terminated RB without SCG, the network indicates whether the UE shall use either KeNB or S-KgNB for a particular DRB. In case of NE-DC, the network indicates whether the UE shall use either KgNB or S-KeNB for a particular DRB. S-KgNB/S-KeNB is derived from KeNB/KgNB as defined in TS 33.501 [86], uses a different counter (sk-Counter) and is used only for DRBs using NR PDCP. Whenever there is a need to refresh S-KgNB/S-KeNB, e.g. upon change of MN or SN, the NR SCG reconfiguration with sync and key change is used for S-KgNB refresh (see 5.3.1.1) and the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including mobilityControlInfoSCG is used for S-KeNB refresh (see 5.3.10.10). E-UTRAN provides a UE configured with (NG)EN-DC with an sk-Counter even when no DRB is setup using S-KgNB i.e. to facilitate configuration of SRB3. The same ciphering algorithm as signalled by nr-RadioBearerConfig1 and nr-RadioBearerConfig2 as defined in TS 38.331 [82] is used for all radio bearers using the same key (i.e. KeNB or S-KgNB). Likewise, the same integrity algorithm as signalled by nr-RadioBearerConfig1 and nr-RadioBearerConfig2 as defined in TS 38.331 [82] is used for all SRBs, and DRBs configured to apply integrity protection of user data, using the same key. Although NR RRC uses different values for the security algorithms than E-UTRA, the actual algorithms are the same in case of (NG)EN-DC and NE-DC in this version of the specification. Hence, for such algorithms, the security capabilities supported by a UE are consistent across these RATs. For MR-DC with 5GC, integrity protection is not enabled for DRBs terminated on ng-eNB or when the master node is an ng-eNB.\nNOTE 2:\tThe network ensures that different values are used for the SCG counter and for the sk-Counter when deriving S-KgNB and/or S-KeNB from the same master key.\nFor RNs, AS security follows the procedures in 5.3.1.2. Furthermore, E-UTRAN may configure per DRB whether or not integrity protection is used. The use of integrity protection may be configured only upon DRB establishment and reconfigured only upon handover or upon the first reconfiguration following RRC connection re-establishment.\nTo provide integrity protection on DRBs between the RN and the E-UTRAN, the KUPint key is derived from the KeNB key as described in TS 33.401 [32]. The same integrity protection algorithm used for SRBs also applies to the DRBs. The KUPint changes at every handover and RRC connection re-establishment and is based on an updated KeNB which is derived by taking into account the nextHopChainingCount. The COUNT value maintained for DRB ciphering is also used for integrity protection, if the integrity protection is configured for the DRB.\nIn RRC_CONNECTED, the network controls UE mobility, i.e. the network decides when the UE shall connect to which E-UTRA cell(s), or inter-RAT cell. For network controlled mobility in RRC_CONNECTED, the PCell can be changed using an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including the mobilityControlInfo (handover), whereas the SCell(s) can be changed using the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message either with or without the mobilityControlInfo.\nIn DC, an SCG can be established, reconfigured or released by using an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message with or without the mobilityControlInfo. In case Random Access to the PSCell or initial PUSCH transmission to the PSCell if rach-SkipSCG is configured is required upon SCG reconfiguration, E-UTRAN employs the SCG change procedure (i.e. an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including the mobilityControlInfoSCG). The PSCell can only be changed using the SCG change procedure and by release and addition of the PSCell.\nIn (NG)EN-DC, an NR SCG can be established or reconfigured by using an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message containing nr-secondaryCellGroupConfig and nr-RadioBearerConfig. The contents of nr-secondaryCellGroupConfig and nr-RadioBearerConfig, of other (NG)EN-DC fields as well as the associated procedures are specified in TS 38.331 [82]. In (NG)EN-DC, the PSCell can only be changed using the Reconfiguration with sync procedure, with or without MR-DC release and addition.\nThe network triggers the handover procedure e.g. based on radio conditions, load. To facilitate this, the network may configure the UE to perform measurement reporting (possibly including the configuration of measurement gaps). The network may also initiate handover blindly, i.e. without having received measurement reports from the UE.\nBefore sending the handover message to the UE, the source eNB prepares one or more target cells. The source eNB selects the target PCell. The source eNB may also provide the target eNB with a list of best cells on each frequency for which measurement information is available, in order of decreasing RSRP. The source eNB may also include available measurement information for the cells provided in the list. The target eNB decides which SCells are configured for use after handover, which may include cells other than the ones indicated by the source eNB. If an SCG is configured, handover involves either SCG release or either SCG change (in case of DC) or an NR SCG reconfiguration with sync and key change (in case of EN-DC and NGEN-DC). In case the UE was configured with (EN-) DC or NGEN-DC, the target eNB indicates in the handover message whether the UE shall release the entire (NR) SCG configuration. Upon connection re-establishment, the UE releases the entire SCG configuration except for the DRB configuration, while E-UTRAN in the first reconfiguration message following the re-establishment either releases the DRB(s) or reconfigures the DRB(s) to MCG DRB(s).\nThe target eNB generates the message used to perform the handover, i.e. the message including the AS-configuration to be used in the target cell(s). The source eNB transparently (i.e. does not alter values/ content) forwards the handover message/ information received from the target to the UE. When appropriate, the source eNB may initiate data forwarding for (a subset of) the DRBs.\nAfter receiving the handover message, the UE attempts to access the target PCell at the first available RACH occasion according to Random Access resource selection defined in TS 36.321 [6], i.e. the handover is asynchronous, or at the first available PUSCH occasion if rach-Skip is configured. Consequently, when allocating a dedicated preamble for the random access in the target PCell, E-UTRA shall ensure it is available from the first RACH occasion the UE may use. The first available PUSCH occasion is provided by ul-ConfigInfo, if configured, otherwise UE shall monitor the PDCCH of target eNB. Upon successful completion of the handover, the UE sends a message used to confirm the handover.\nIf the target eNB does not support the release of RRC protocol which the source eNB used to configure the UE, the target eNB may be unable to comprehend the UE configuration provided by the source eNB. In this case, the target eNB should use the full configuration option to reconfigure the UE for Handover and Re-establishment. Full configuration option includes an initialization of the radio configuration, which makes the procedure independent of the configuration used in the source cell(s) with the exception that the security algorithms are continued for the RRC re-establishment.\nThe same behavior applies in (NG)EN-DC, if upon handover the target eNB is unable to comprehend the MCG part of the UE configuration i.e. the target eNB uses the full configuration option which involves release and configuration of (most of the) MCG and NR SCG configuration. In case of (NG)EN-DC, the target SgNB may be unable to comprehend the NR SCG configuration provided by the source SgNB. In such a case, release and addition may be applied for the NR SCG part of the configuration.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen using release and addition for the NR SCG configuration during handover or SN change, E-UTRAN includes drb-ToReleaseList for the SN terminated RBs. For SN modification case, see TS 37.340 [81].\nAfter the successful completion of handover, PDCP SDUs may be re-transmitted in the target cell(s). This only applies for DRBs using RLC-AM mode and for handovers not involving full configuration option. The further details are specified in TS 36.323 [8]. After the successful completion of handover not involving full configuration option, the SN and the HFN are reset except for the DRBs using RLC-AM mode (for which both SN and HFN continue). For reconfigurations involving the full configuration option, the PDCP entities are newly established (SN and HFN do not continue) for all DRBs irrespective of the RLC mode. The further details are specified in TS 36.323 [8].\nOne UE behaviour to be performed upon handover is specified, i.e. this is regardless of the handover procedures used within the network (e.g. whether the handover includes X2 or S1 signalling procedures).\nThe source eNB should, for some time, maintain a context to enable the UE to return in case of handover failure. After having detected handover failure, the UE attempts to resume the RRC connection either in the source PCell or in another cell using the RRC re-establishment procedure. This connection resumption succeeds only if the accessed cell is prepared, i.e. concerns a cell of the source eNB or of another eNB towards which handover preparation has been performed. The cell in which the re-establishment procedure succeeds becomes the PCell while SCells and STAGs, if configured, are released.\nNormal measurement and mobility procedures are used to support handover to cells broadcasting a CSG identity. In addition, E-UTRAN may configure the UE to report that it is entering or leaving the proximity of cell(s) included in its Permitted CSG list. Furthermore, E-UTRAN may request the UE to provide additional information broadcast by the handover candidate cell e.g. global cell identity, CSG identity, CSG membership status.\nNOTE 2:\tE-UTRAN may use the 'proximity report' to configure measurements as well as to decide whether or not to request additional information broadcast by the handover candidate cell. The additional information is used to verify whether or not the UE is authorised to access the target PCell and may also be needed to identify handover candidate cell (PCI confusion i.e. when the physical layer identity that is included in the measurement report does not uniquely identify the cell).\nIn NB-IoT, during the RRC connection establishment procedure, SRB1bis is established implicitly with SRB1. SRB1bis uses the logical channel identity defined in 9.1.2a, with the same configuration as SRB1 but no PDCP entity. SRB1bis is used until security is activated. The RRC messages to activate security (command and successful response) are sent over SRB1 being integrity protected and ciphering is started after completion of the procedure. In case of unsuccessful security activation, the failure message is sent over SRB1 and subsequent messages are sent over SRB1bis. Once security is activated, new RRC messages shall be transmitted using SRB1. A NB-IoT UE that only supports the Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation (see TS 24.301 [35]) or the Control Plane CIoT 5GS optimisation (see TS 24.501 [95]) only establishes SRB1bis.\nA NB-IoT UE only supports 0, 1 or 2 DRBs, depending on its capability. A NB-IoT UE that only supports the Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation (see TS 24.301 [35]) or the Control Plane CIoT 5GS optimisation (see TS 24.501 [95]) does not need to support any DRBs and associated procedures.\nTable 5.3.1.4-1 lists the procedures that are applicable for NB-IoT. All other procedures are not applicable; this is not further stated in the corresponding procedures.\nTable 5.3.1.4-1: Connection control procedures applicable to a NB-IoT UE\n\nNOTE:\tNot applicable for a UE that only supports the Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation (see TS 24.301 [35]) or the Control Plane CIoT 5GS optimisation (see TS 24.501 [95]).\n",

The figure is essential for understanding the complex interactions between the RRC (Radio Resource Control) and the network in a mobile communication system.\nFigure 5.3.3.1-5: RRC connection resume or UP-EDT or UP transmission using PUR, network reject (suspended RRC connection or RRC_INACTIVE) or release (suspended RRC connection)\nFigure 5.3.3.1-6 illustrates the process of RRC connection resume (RRC_INACTIVE), network release, suspend, or UP-EDT or UP transmission using PUR, with a successful outcome. The figure showcases the various stages of the process, including the establishment of a connection, the release or suspension of the network, and the successful transmission using the proposed protocol. The figure is essential for understanding the intricacies of maintaining and optimizing wireless communication networks.\nFigure 5.3.3.1-6: RRC connection resume (RRC_INACTIVE), network release or suspend or UP-EDT or UP transmission using PUR, successful\nFigure 5.3.3.1-7 illustrates the successful transmission of CP-EDT (Control Plane-Enhanced Data Transmission) using PUR (Protection and Restoration) in a telecommunication network. The figure depicts the various components involved, including the CP (Control Plane), EDC (Enhanced Data Channel), and the use of PUR for redundancy and restoration. The successful transmission is represented by the green arrow, indicating the uninterrupted flow of data between the nodes. The figure emphasizes the importance of CP-EDT and PUR in maintaining network reliability and efficiency.\nFigure 5.3.3.1-7: CP-EDT or CP transmission using PUR, successful\nFigure 5.3.3.1-7a illustrates the successful transmission of Control Plane (CP) data using the Protocol Independent Codec (PUR) in a telecommunication network. The figure depicts the CP data flow, including the CP header, payload, and the use of PUR for efficient data transmission. The successful transmission is indicated by the green checkmark, highlighting the effectiveness of the PUR protocol in maintaining network control and ensuring data integrity.\nFigure 5.3.3.1-7a: CP transmission using PUR, successful\nFigure 5.3.3.1-8 illustrates the fallback process from CP transmission using PUR to RRC connection establishment, indicating a successful outcome.

The diagram showcases the interaction between the mobile station (MS), the network elements, and the signaling system, emphasizing the importance of efficient communication and error handling in maintaining connectivity.\nFigure 5.3.5.1-2: RRC connection reconfiguration, failure\nThe purpose of this procedure is to modify an RRC connection, e.g. to establish/ modify/ release RBs, to perform handover, to setup/ modify/ release measurements, to add/ modify/ release SCells, to add/modify/release conditional reconfigurations. As part of the procedure, NAS dedicated information may be transferred from E-UTRAN to the UE.\nE-UTRAN may initiate the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED. E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:\n-\tthe mobilityControlInfo is included only when AS-security has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB are setup and not suspended;\n-\tthe establishment of RBs (other than SRB1, that is established during RRC connection establishment) is included only when AS security has been activated;\n-\tthe addition of SCells is performed only when AS security has been activated;\n-\tthe addition, release or modification of conditional reconfigurations is performed only when AS security has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB are setup and not suspended;\nThe UE initiates the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure while in RRC_CONNECTED when a conditional reconfiguration (e.g. CHO, CPA, or inter-SN CPC) is executed i.e. upon the fulfilment of an execution condition, an associated RRCConnectionReconfiguration that is stored is applied.\nNOTE:\tEmbedding in an NR Reconfiguration is used for the transfer of IRAT DL DCCH information as used for V2X sidelink communication related information specified by NR RRC e.g. to configure dedicated pool related information, CBR measurements, provision of grant assistance.\nIf

The figure showcases the various stages of re-establishing a radio link connection, starting from the initial connection attempt, followed by the handover process, and finally the successful re-establishment of the connection. The figure highlights the role of the Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol in ensuring reliable communication between the mobile device and the network. Key components include the mobile station (MS), home base station (H-BTS), and the network elements involved in the handover process. The figure emphasizes the importance of efficient handover management in maintaining seamless connectivity for mobile users.\nFigure 5.3.7.1-1: RRC connection re-establishment, successful\nFigure 5.3.7.1-2 illustrates the process of RRC connection re-establishment and failure in a telecommunication system. The figure depicts the various stages of RRC connection re-establishment, including the initial connection, connection failure, and subsequent re-establishment. The figure also shows the different components involved in the process, such as the RRC connection manager, the RRC connection failure manager, and the RRC connection re-establishment manager. The figure provides a clear and concise overview of the RRC connection re-establishment process and its various components, making it a valuable resource for understanding this complex telecommunication process.\nFigure 5.3.7.1-2: RRC connection re-establishment, failure\nThe purpose of this procedure is to re-establish the RRC connection, which involves the resumption of SRB1 (SRB1bis for a NB-IoT UE for which AS security has not been activated) operation, the re-activation of security (except for a NB-IoT UE for which AS security has not been activated) and the configuration of only the PCell.\nExcept for a NB-IoT UE for which AS security has not been activated, a UE in RRC_CONNECTED, for which security has been activated, may initiate the procedure in order to continue the RRC connection. The connection re-establishment succeeds only if the concerned cell is prepared i.e. has a valid UE context. In case E-UTRAN accepts the re-establishment, SRB1 operation resumes while the operation of other radio bearers remains suspended. If AS security has not been activated, the UE does not initiate the procedure but instead moves to RRC_IDLE directly.\nWhen AS security has not been activated, a NB-IoT UE supporting RRC connection re-establishment for the Control Plane CIoT EPS/5GS optimisation in RRC_CONNECTED may initiate the procedure in order to continue the RRC connection.\nE-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:\n-\tWhen AS security has been activated:\n-\tto reconfigure SRB1 and to resume data transfer only for this RB;\n-\tto re-activate AS security without changing algorithms.\n-\tFor a NB-IoT UE supporting RRC connection re-establishment for the Control Plane CIoT EPS/5GS optimisation, when AS security has not been activated:\n-\tto re-establish SRB1bis and to continue data transfer for this RB.\nIf systemInformationBlockType31 (systemInformationBlockType31-NB in NB-IoT) is broadcast, a RRC connection re-establishment is initiated only if the UE has a valid GNSS position.\nNOTE:\tThe UE may need to re-acquire the GNSS position before re-establishing the connection to avoid interruption during the connection.\nThe UE shall only initiate the procedure either when AS security has been activated or for a NB-IoT UE supporting RRC connection re-establishment for the Control Plane CIoT EPS/5GS optimisation. The UE initiates the procedure when one of the following conditions is met:\n1>\tupon detecting radio link failure and T316 is not configured, in accordance with 5.3.11; or\n1>\tupon detecting radio link failure of the MCG while SCG transmission is suspended, in accordance with 5.3.11;

The figure depicts the movement of a mobile device as it transitions from one cell to another, with the eNB being the final destination. The figure highlights the role of the E-UTRAN network in providing seamless connectivity and the importance of efficient handover procedures for maintaining uninterrupted service quality.\nFigure 5.4.2.1-1: Handover to E-UTRA, successful\nThe purpose of this procedure is to, under the control of the network, transfer a connection between the UE and another Radio Access Network (e.g. GERAN, UTRAN or NR) to E-UTRAN, or transfer a connection between the UE and the E-UTRAN with one type of CN to the E-UTRAN with a different type of CN.\nThe handover to E-UTRA procedure applies when SRBs, possibly in combination with DRBs, are established in another RAT or in E-UTRA connected to another type of CN. Handover from UTRAN to E-UTRAN applies only after integrity has been activated in UTRAN. Handover to E-UTRA connected to a different type of CN applies only after integrity has been activated in E-UTRAN. Handover from NR to E-UTRAN applies only after integrity has been activated in NR.\nThe RAN using another RAT or the E-UTRA connected to a different type of CN initiates the handover to E-UTRA procedure, in accordance with the specifications applicable for the other RAT or for the E-UTRA connected to a different type of CN, by sending the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message via the radio access technology from which the inter-RAT handover is performed.\nE-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:\n-\tto activate ciphering, possibly using NULL algorithm, if not yet activated in the other RAT or in the E-UTRA connected to a different type of CN;\n-\tto establish SRB1, SRB2 and one or more DRBs, i.e. at least the DRB associated with the default EPS bearer is established if the target CN

E-UTRAN provides the measurement configuration or the conditional reconfiguration applicable for a UE in RRC_CONNECTED by means of dedicated signalling, i.e. using the RRCConnectionReconfiguration or RRCConnectionResume message.\nThe UE can be requested to perform the following types of measurements:\n-\tIntra-frequency measurements: measurements at the downlink carrier frequency(ies) of the serving cell(s).\n-\tInter-frequency measurements: measurements at frequencies that differ from any of the downlink carrier frequency(ies) of the serving cell(s).\n-\tInter-RAT measurements of NR frequencies.\n-\tInter-RAT measurements of UTRA frequencies.\n-\tInter-RAT measurements of GERAN frequencies.\n-\tInter-RAT measurements of CDMA2000 HRPD or CDMA2000 1xRTT or WLAN frequencies.\n-\tCBR measurements for V2X sidelink communication.\n-\tSensing measurements for V2X sidelink communication.\nThe measurement configuration includes the following parameters:\n1.\tMeasurement objects: The objects on which the UE shall perform the measurements.\n-\tFor intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements a measurement object is a single E-UTRA carrier frequency. Associated with this carrier frequency, E-UTRAN can configure a list of cell specific offsets, a list of 'exclude-listed' cells and a list of 'allow-listed' cells. Exclude-listed cells are not considered in event evaluation or measurement reporting.\n-\tFor inter-RAT NR measurements a measurement object is a single NR carrier frequency. Associated with this carrier frequency, E-UTRAN can configure a list of 'exclude-listed' cells. Exclude-listed cells are not considered in event evaluation or measurement reporting.\n-\tFor inter-RAT UTRA measurements a measurement object is a set of cells on a single UTRA carrier frequency.\n-\tFor inter-RAT GERAN measurements a measurement object is a set of GERAN carrier frequencies.\n-\tFor inter-RAT CDMA2000 measurements a measurement object is a set of cells on a single (HRPD or 1xRTT) carrier frequency.\n-\tFor inter-RAT WLAN measurements a measurement object is a set of WLAN identifiers and optionally a set of WLAN frequencies.\n-\tFor CBR measurements and sensing measurements a measurement object is a set of transmission resource pools for V2X sidelink communication.\nNOTE 1:\tSome measurements using the above mentioned measurement objects, only concern a single cell, e.g. measurements used to report neighbouring cell system information, PCell UE Rx-Tx time difference, or a pair of cells, e.g. SSTD measurements between the PCell and the PSCell.\n2.\tReporting configurations: A list of measurement reporting configurations where each measurement reporting configuration consists of the following:\n-\tReporting criterion: The criterion that triggers the UE to send a measurement report. This can either be periodical or a single event description.\n-\tReporting format: The quantities that the UE includes in the measurement report and associated information (e.g. number of cells to report).\nIn case of conditional handover, conditional PSCell addition or MN initiated inter-SN conditional PSCell change triggering configuration, each configuration consists of the following:\n-\tExecution criteria: The criteria that triggers the UE to perform conditional handover, conditional PSCell addition or MN initiated inter-SN conditional PSCell change.\n3.\tMeasurement identities: For measurement reporting, a list of measurement identities where each measurement identity links one measurement object with one measurement reporting configuration. By configuring multiple measurement identities it is possible to link more than one measurement object to the same reporting configuration, as well as to link more than one reporting configuration to the same measurement object. The measurement identity is used as a reference number in the measurement report. For conditional reconfiguration triggering, one measurement identity links to exactly one conditional reconfiguration trigger configuration. And up to two measurement identities can be linked to one conditional reconfiguration execution condition.\n4.\tQuantity configurations: One quantity configuration is configured per RAT type. The quantity configuration defines the measurement quantities and associated filtering used for all event evaluation and related reporting of that measurement type. One filter can be configured per measurement quantity, except for NR where the network may configure up to 2 sets of quantity configurations each comprising per measurement quantity seperate filters for cell and RS index measurement results. The quantity configuration set that applies for a given measurement is indicated within the NR measurement object.\n5.\tMeasurement gaps: Periods that the UE may use to perform measurements, i.e. no (UL, DL) transmissions are scheduled.\nE-UTRAN only configures a single measurement object for a given frequency (except for WLAN and except for CBR measurements), i.e. it is not possible to configure two or more measurement objects for the same frequency with different associated parameters, e.g. different offsets and/ or exclude-lists. E-UTRAN may configure multiple instances of the same event e.g. by configuring two reporting configurations with different thresholds.\nThe UE maintains a single measurement object list, a single reporting configuration list, and a single measurement identities list. The measurement object list includes measurement objects, that are specified per RAT type, possibly including intra-frequency object(s) (i.e. the object(s) corresponding to the serving frequency(ies)), inter-frequency object(s) and inter-RAT objects. Similarly, the reporting configuration list includes E-UTRA and inter-RAT reporting configurations. Any measurement object can be linked to any reporting configuration of the same RAT type. Some reporting configurations may not be linked to a measurement object. Likewise, some measurement objects may not be linked to a reporting configuration.\nThe measurement procedures distinguish the following types of cells:\n1.\tThe serving cell(s) - these are the PCell and one or more SCells, if configured for a UE supporting CA or DC. Likewise, NR serving cell(s) are the NR PCell, NR PSCell and NR SCells, if the UE is configured with MR-DC.\n2.\tListed cells - these are cells listed within the measurement object(s) or, for inter-RAT WLAN, the WLANs matching the WLAN identifiers configured in the measurement object or the WLAN the UE is connected to.\n3.\tDetected cells - these are cells that are not listed within the measurement object(s) but are detected by the UE on the carrier frequency(ies) indicated by the measurement object(s) or, for inter-RAT WLAN, the WLANs not included in the measObjectWLAN but meeting the triggering requirements.\nFor E-UTRA, the UE measures and reports on the serving cell(s), listed cells, detected cells, transmission resource pools for V2X sidelink communication, and, for RSSI and channel occupancy measurements, the UE measures and reports on any reception on the indicated frequency. For inter-RAT NR, the UE measures and reports on detected cells and, if configured with MR-DC, on NR serving cell(s) and, for RSSI and channel occupancy measurements, the UE measures and reports on the indicated frequency. For inter-RAT UTRA, the UE measures and reports on listed cells and optionally on cells that are within a range for which reporting is allowed by E-UTRAN. For inter-RAT GERAN, the UE measures and reports on detected cells. For inter-RAT CDMA2000, the UE measures and reports on listed cells. For inter-RAT WLAN, the UE measures and reports on listed cells.\nNOTE 2:\tFor inter-RAT UTRA and CDMA2000, the UE measures and reports also on detected cells for the purpose of SON.\nNOTE 3:\tThis specification is based on the assumption that typically CSG cells of home deployment type are not indicated within the neighbour list. Furthermore, the assumption is that for non-home deployments, the physical cell identity is unique within the area of a large macro cell (i.e. as for UTRAN).\nWhenever the procedural specification, other than contained in clause 5.5.2, refers to a field it concerns a field included in the VarMeasConfig unless explicitly stated otherwise i.e. only the measurement configuration procedure covers the direct UE action related to the received measConfig.\n",

                            "text_content": "In general the control information relevant only for UEs supporting MBMS is separated as much as possible from unicast control information. Most of the MBMS control information is provided on a logical channel specific for MBMS common control information: the MCCH. E-UTRA employs one MCCH logical channel per MBSFN area. In case the network configures multiple MBSFN areas, the UE acquires the MBMS control information from the MCCHs that are configured to identify if services it is interested to receive are ongoing. The action applicable when the UE is unable to simultaneously receive MBMS and unicast services is up to UE implementation. In this release of the specification, an MBMS capable UE is only required to support reception of a single MBMS service at a time, and reception of more than one MBMS service (also possibly on more than one MBSFN area) in parallel is left for UE implementation. The MCCH carries the MBSFNAreaConfiguration message, which indicates the MBMS sessions that are ongoing as well as the (corresponding) radio resource configuration. The MCCH may also carry the MBMSCountingRequest message, when E-UTRAN wishes to count the number of UEs in RRC_CONNECTED that are receiving or interested to receive one or more specific MBMS services.\nA limited amount of MBMS control information is provided on the BCCH. This primarily concerns the information needed to acquire the MCCH(s). This information is carried by means of a single MBMS specific SystemInformationBlock: SystemInformationBlockType13. An MBSFN area is identified solely by the mbsfn-AreaId in SystemInformationBlockType13. At mobility, the UE considers that the MBSFN area is continuous when the source cell and the target cell broadcast the same value in the mbsfn-AreaId.\nThe MCCH information is transmitted periodically, using a configurable repetition period. Scheduling information is not provided for MCCH i.e. both the time domain scheduling as well as the lower layer configuration are semi-statically configured, as defined within SystemInformationBlockType13.\nFor MBMS user data, which is carried by the MTCH logical channel, E-UTRAN periodically provides MCH scheduling information (MSI) at lower layers (MAC). This MCH information only concerns the time domain scheduling i.e. the frequency domain scheduling and the lower layer configuration are semi-statically configured. The periodicity of the MSI is configurable and defined by the MCH scheduling period.\nChange of MCCH information only occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the concept of a modification period is used. Within a modification period, the same MCCH information may be transmitted a number of times, as defined by its scheduling (which is based on a repetition period). The modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod m= 0, where m is the number of radio frames comprising the modification period. The modification period is configured by means of SystemInformationBlockType13.\nWhen the network changes (some of) the MCCH information, it notifies the UEs about the change during a first modification period. In the next modification period, the network transmits the updated MCCH information. These general principles are illustrated in figure 5.8.1.3-1, in which different colours indicate different MCCH information. Upon receiving a change notification, a UE interested to receive MBMS services acquires the new MCCH information immediately from the start of the next modification period. The UE applies the previously acquired MCCH information until the UE acquires the new MCCH information.\nFigure 5.8.1.3-1 illustrates the process of changing MCCH (Mobile Country Code Header) information in a telecommunication system. The figure depicts the MCCH structure, which includes the MCCH ID, MCCH Type, and MCCH Length fields. The MCCH is a crucial element in the GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) protocol, as it carries information about the mobile station's capabilities and preferences. The figure shows how the MCCH information is updated through a series of signaling exchanges between the mobile station and the network. This process is essential for maintaining accurate and up-to-date information about the mobile station's capabilities, ensuring seamless communication and efficient resource allocation within the network.\nFigure 5.8.1.3-1: Change of MCCH Information\nIndication of an MBMS specific RNTI, the M-RNTI (see TS 36.321 [6]), on PDCCH is used to inform UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED about an MCCH information change. When receiving an MCCH information change notification, the UE knows that the MCCH information will change at the next modification period boundary. The notification on PDCCH indicates which of the MCCHs will change, which is done by means of an 8-bit bitmap. Within this bitmap, the bit at the position indicated by the field notificationIndicator is used to indicate changes for that MBSFN area: if the bit is set to \"1\", the corresponding MCCH will change. No further details are provided e.g. regarding which MCCH information will change. The MCCH information change notification is used to inform the UE about a change of MCCH information upon session start or about the start of MBMS counting.\nThe MCCH information change notifications on PDCCH are transmitted periodically and are carried on MBSFN subframes only except on MBMS-dedicated cell or FeMBMS/Unicast-mixed cell where the MCCH information change is provided on non-MBSFN subframes. These MCCH information change notification occasions are common for all MCCHs that are configured, and configurable by parameters included in SystemInformationBlockType13: a repetition coefficient, a radio frame offset and a subframe index. These common notification occasions are based on the MCCH with the shortest modification period.\nNOTE 1:\tE-UTRAN may modify the MBMS configuration information provided on MCCH at the same time as updating the MBMS configuration information carried on BCCH i.e. at a coinciding BCCH and MCCH modification period. Upon detecting that a new MCCH is configured on BCCH, a UE interested to receive one or more MBMS services should acquire the MCCH, unless it knows that the services it is interested in are not provided by the corresponding MBSFN area.\nA UE that is receiving an MBMS service via MRB shall acquire the MCCH information from the start of each modification period. A UE interested to receive MBMS from a carrier on which dl-Bandwidth included in MasterInformationBlock is set to n6 shall acquire the MCCH information at least once every MCCH modification period. A UE that is not receiving an MBMS service via MRB, as well as UEs that are receiving an MBMS service via MRB but potentially interested to receive other services not started yet in another MBSFN area from a carrier on which dl-Bandwidth included in MasterInformationBlock is other than n6, shall verify that the stored MCCH information remains valid by attempting to find the MCCH information change notification at least notificationRepetitionCoeff times during the modification period of the applicable MCCH(s), if no MCCH information change notification is received.\nNOTE 2:\tIn case the UE is aware which MCCH(s) E-UTRAN uses for the service(s) it is interested to receive, the UE may only need to monitor change notifications for a subset of the MCCHs that are configured, referred to as the 'applicable MCCH(s)' in the above.\n",

                            "text_content": "SC-PTM control information is provided on a specific logical channel: the SC-MCCH. The SC-MCCH carries the SCPTMConfiguration message which indicates the MBMS sessions that are ongoing as well as the (corresponding) information on when each session may be scheduled, i.e. scheduling period, scheduling window and start offset. The SCPTMConfiguration message also provides information about the neighbour cells transmitting the MBMS sessions which are ongoing on the current cell. In this release of the specification, an SC-PTM capable UE is only required to support reception of a single MBMS service at a time, and reception of more than one MBMS service in parallel is left for UE implementation.\nA limited amount of SC-PTM control information is provided on the BCCH or BR-BCCH. This primarily concerns the information needed to acquire the SC-MCCH.\nNOTE:\tFor BL UEs and UEs in CE, SC-MCCH transmission uses a 1.4 MHz channel bandwidth and a maximum TBS of 936 bits, see TS 36.213 [23]. For NB-IoT UEs, the maximum TBS for SC-MCCH transmission is 680 bits, see TS 36.213 [23].\nThe SC-MCCH information (i.e. information transmitted in messages sent over SC-MCCH) is transmitted periodically, using a configurable repetition period. SC-MCCH transmissions (and the associated radio resources and MCS) are indicated on PDCCH.\nChange of SC-MCCH information only occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the concept of a modification period is used. Within a modification period, the same SC-MCCH information may be transmitted a number of times, as defined by its scheduling (which is based on a repetition period). The modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod m= 0, where m is the number of radio frames comprising the modification period. The modification period is configured by means of SystemInformationBlockType20 (SystemInformationBlockType20-NB in NB-IoT). If H-SFN is provided in SystemInformationBlockType1-BR, modification period boundaries for BL UEs or UEs in CE are defined by SFN values for which (H-SFN * 1024 + SFN) mod m=0. The modification period boundaries for NB-IoT UEs are defined by SFN values for which (H-SFN * 1024 + SFN) mod m=0.\nWhen the network changes (some of) the SC-MCCH information, it notifies the UEs, other than BL UEs, UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs, about the change in the first subframe which can be used for SC-MCCH transmission in a repetition period. LSB bit in 8-bit bitmap when set to '1' indicates the change in SC-MCCH. Upon receiving a change notification, a UE interested to receive MBMS services transmitted using SC-PTM acquires the new SC-MCCH information starting from the same subframe. The UE applies the previously acquired SC-MCCH information until the UE acquires the new SC-MCCH information.\nWhen the network changes (some of) the SC-MCCH information for start of new MBMS service(s) transmitted using SC-PTM, it notifies BL UEs, UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs about the change in every PDCCH which schedules the first SC-MCCH in a repetition period in the current modification period. The notification is transmitted with 1 bit. The bit, when set to '1', indicates the start of new MBMS service(s), see TS 36.212 [22], clauses 5.3.3.1.14 and 6.4.3.3. Upon receiving a change notification, a BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE interested to receive MBMS services transmitted using SC-PTM acquires the new SC-MCCH information scheduled by the PDCCH. The BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE applies the previously acquired SC-MCCH information until the BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE acquires the new SC-MCCH information.\nWhen the network changes SC-MTCH specific information e.g. start of new MBMS service(s) transmitted using SC-PTM or change of ongoing MBMS service(s) transmitted using SC-PTM, it notifies the BL UEs, UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs in the PDCCH which schedules the SC-MTCH in the current modification period. The notification is transmitted with a 2 bit bitmap. The LSB in the 2-bit bitmap, when set to '1', indicates the change of the on-going MBMS service and the MSB in the 2-bit bitmap, when set to '1', indicates the start of new MBMS service(s), see TS 36.212 [22], clauses 5.3.3.1.12, 5.3.3.1.13 and 6.4.3.2. In the case the network changes an on-going SC-MTCH transmission in the next modification period, it notifies the BL UEs, UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs in the PDCCH which schedules this SC-MTCH in the current modification period. In the case the network starts new MBMS service(s) transmitted using SC-PTM, the network notifies the UEs which have on-going SC-MTCH in the PDCCH scheduling each of the SC-MTCH. Upon receiving such notification, a BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE acquires the new SC-MCCH information at the start of the next modification period. The BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE applies the previously acquired SC-MCCH information until the BL UE, UE in CE or NB-IoT UE acquires the new SC-MCCH information.\nThe SC-PTM capable UE receiving or interested to receive MBMS service(s) via SC-MRB applies SC-PTM procedures described in 5.8a and, except for NB-IoT UE, the MBMS interest indication procedure as specified in 5.8.5.\n",

The figure depicts the exchange of synchronization signals between the network elements, such as the eNodeB, MME, and PDN Gateway, to ensure accurate time synchronization and reliable communication. This is crucial for maintaining seamless connectivity and coordination among vehicles and roadside units in a vehicular communication system. The figure highlights the importance of precise timing and synchronization in enabling efficient sidelink communication, which is essential for applications such as cooperative awareness, cooperative positioning, and cooperative navigation.\nFigure 5.10.7.1-1: Synchronisation information transmission for sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication, in (partial) coverage\nFigure 5.10.7.1-2 illustrates the synchronization information transmission for sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication, which is crucial for maintaining accurate time synchronization between devices in a vehicular communication network. The figure depicts the process of information transmission when a device is out of coverage, highlighting the importance of efficient sidelink communication in ensuring seamless connectivity and data exchange even in areas with limited network coverage. The figure showcases the synchronization process, which is essential for maintaining accurate time synchronization between devices, thereby enabling efficient communication and coordination among vehicles and other roadside units (RSUs) in the network.\nFigure 5.10.7.1-2: Synchronisation information transmission for sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication / sidelink discovery, out of coverage\nFigure 5.10.7.1-3 illustrates the synchronization information transmission for sidelink discovery in a network that is partially covered. The figure depicts the process of how devices in the network synchronize their clocks and establish sidelink connections. The key components include the synchronization signals, the sidelink discovery process, and the network coverage. The figure highlights the importance of accurate clock synchronization for seamless communication and connection establishment in a partially covered network.\nFigure 5.10.7.1-3: Synchronisation information transmission for sidelink discovery, in (partial) coverage\nThe purpose of this procedure is to provide synchronisation information to a UE. For sidelink discovery, the synchronisation information concerns a Sidelink Synchronisation Signal (SLSS) and, in case of PS related discovery, also timing information and some additional configuration parameters (i.e. the MasterInformationBlock-SL message), while for sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication it concerns an SLSS and the MasterInformationBlock-SL or MasterInformationBlock-SL-V2X message. A UE transmits synchronisation information either when E-UTRAN configures it to do so by dedicated signalling (i.e. network based), or when not configured by dedicated signalling (i.e. UE based) and E-UTRAN broadcasts (in coverage) or pre-configures a threshold (out of coverage).\nThe synchronisation information transmitted by the UE may be derived from information/ signals received from E-UTRAN (in coverage) or received from a UE acting as synchronisation reference for the transmitting UE or received from GNSS.

The figure depicts the synchronization signals being transmitted from the eNB (evolved Node B) to the UE (User Equipment) through the air interface. The synchronization signals are essential for maintaining accurate timing and frequency synchronization between the eNB and the UE, ensuring seamless communication and coordination. The figure highlights the importance of synchronization in NR sidelink communication, particularly in areas with limited coverage, where maintaining accurate timing and frequency synchronization becomes crucial for maintaining reliable communication.\nFigure 5.10.16-1: Synchronisation information transmission for NR sidelink communication, in (partial) coverage\nFigure 5.10.16-2 illustrates the synchronization information transmission for NR sidelink communication in the event of being out of coverage. The figure depicts the process of time synchronization between the eNB and the UE, which is crucial for maintaining reliable communication. The diagram shows the exchange of synchronization messages between the two, ensuring that they are synchronized even when they are not in direct communication. This is particularly important in scenarios where the UE is out of the coverage area of the eNB, as it allows for seamless handover and ensures that the UE remains connected to the network. The figure highlights the importance of precise time synchronization in modern communication systems, particularly in the context of NR sidelink communication.\nFigure 5.10.16-2: Synchronisation information transmission for NR sidelink communication, out of coverage\nThe purpose of this procedure is to provide synchronisation information to a UE.\nThe initiation and the procedure for the transmission of sidelink SSB follow the procedure specified for NR sidelink communication in clause 5.8.5 of TS 38.331 [82].\nNOTE:\tWhen applying the procedure in this clause, SystemInformationBlockType28 in Figure 5.10.16-1 corresponds to SIB12 specified in TS 38.331 [82].\n",

The figure showcases the PRS sensor's ability to measure and analyze the offset field, which is essential for determining the distance and direction of objects in a given area. The diagram features a PRS sensor, a target object, and a receiver, demonstrating how the sensor's measurements are used to calculate the offset field. This information is vital for applications such as precision agriculture, where the accurate measurement of distances is paramount. The figure highlights the PRS system's precision and effectiveness in challenging environments, such as those with strong reflections or multiple targets.\nFigure 6.2.2-1 (informative): Exemplary calculation of measPRS-Offset field.\n\nThe LoggedMeasurementConfiguration message is used by E-UTRAN to configure the UE to perform logging of measurement results while in RRC_IDLE or to perform logging of measurement results for MBSFN while in both RRC_IDLE and RRC_CONNECTED.

to the default CQI/ SRS/ SR configuration in accordance with clause 5.3.13 and TS 36.321 [6], clauses 5.9 and 5.2. Hence, for these parts of the dedicated radio resource configuration, the default configuration (rather than the configuration used in the source PCell) is used as the basis for the delta signalling that is included in the message used to perform handover.\nNOTE 2:\tSince delta signalling is not supported for the common SCell configuration, E-UTRAN can only add or release the uplink of an SCell by releasing and adding the concerned SCell.\nThe IE P-Max is used to limit the UE's uplink transmission power on a carrier frequency and is used to calculate the parameter Pcompensation defined in TS 36.304 [4]. Corresponds to parameter PEMAX or PEMAX,c in TS 36.101 [42]. The UE transmit power on one serving cell shall not exceed the configured maximum UE output power of the serving cell determined by this value as specified in TS 36.101 [42], clauses 6.2.5 or 6.2.5A, or, when transmitting sidelink discovery announcements within the coverage of the concerned cell, as specified in TS 36.101 [42], clause 6.2.5D.\nP-Max information element\n-- ASN1START\n\nP-Max ::=\t\t\t\tINTEGER (-30..33)\n\n-- ASN1STOP\n\nThe IE PRACH-ConfigSIB and IE PRACH-Config are used to specify the PRACH configuration in the system information and in the mobility control information, respectively.\nPRACH-Config information elements\n-- ASN1START\n\nPRACH-ConfigSIB ::=\t\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\nrootSequenceIndex\t\t\t\t\tINTEGER (0..837),\nprach-ConfigInfo\t\t\t\t\tPRACH-ConfigInfo\n}\n\nPRACH-ConfigSIB-v1310 ::=\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\nrsrp-ThresholdsPrachInfoList-r13\t\tRSRP-ThresholdsPrachInfoList-r13,\nmpdcch-startSF-CSS-RA-r13\t\t\tCHOICE {\nfdd-r13\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {v1, v1dot5, v2, v2dot5, v4, v5, v8,\nv10},\ntdd-r13\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {v1, v2, v4, v5, v8, v10, v20, spare}\n}\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Cond MP\nprach-HoppingOffset-r13\t\t\t\tINTEGER (0..94)\t\t\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need OR\nprach-ParametersListCE-r13\t\t\tPRACH-ParametersListCE-r13\n}\n\nPRACH-ConfigSIB-v1530 ::=\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\nedt-PRACH-ParametersListCE-r15\t\tSEQUENCE (SIZE(1..maxCE-Level-r13)) OF EDT-PRACH-ParametersCE-r15\n}\n\nPRACH-Config ::=\t\t\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\nrootSequenceIndex\t\t\t\t\tINTEGER (0..837),\nprach-ConfigInfo\t\t\t\t\tPRACH-ConfigInfo\t\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL\t-- Need ON\n}\n\nPRACH-Config-v1310 ::=\t\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\nrsrp-ThresholdsPrachInfoList-r13\t\tRSRP-ThresholdsPrachInfoList-r13\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Cond MP\nmpdcch-startSF-CSS-RA-r13\t\t\tCHOICE {\nfdd-r13\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {v1, v1dot5, v2, v2dot5, v4, v5, v8,\nv10},\ntdd-r13\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {v1, v2, v4, v5, v8, v10, v20, spare}\n}\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Cond MP\nprach-HoppingOffset-r13\t\t\t\tINTEGER (0..94)\t\t\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need OR\nprach-ParametersListCE-r13\t\t\tPRACH-ParametersListCE-r13\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Cond MP\ninitial-CE-level-r13\t\t\t\t\tINTEGER (0..3)\t\tOPTIONAL\t-- Need OR\n}\n\nPRACH-Config-v1430 ::=\t\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\nrootSequenceIndexHighSpeed-r14\t\t\t\tINTEGER (0..837),\nzeroCorrelationZoneConfigHighSpeed-r14\t\tINTEGER (0..12),\nprach-ConfigIndexHighSpeed-r14\t\t\t\tINTEGER (0..63),\nprach-FreqOffsetHighSpeed-r14\t\t\t\tINTEGER (0..94)\n}\n\nPRACH-ConfigSCell-r10 ::=\t\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\nprach-ConfigIndex-r10\t\t\t\t\tINTEGER (0..63)\n}\n\nPRACH-ConfigInfo ::=\t\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\nprach-ConfigIndex\t\t\t\t\tINTEGER (0..63),\nhighSpeedFlag\t\t\t\t\t\tBOOLEAN,\nzeroCorrelationZoneConfig\t\t\tINTEGER (0..15),\nprach-FreqOffset\t\t\t\t\tINTEGER (0..94)\n}\n\nPRACH-ParametersListCE-r13 ::=\tSEQUENCE (SIZE(1..maxCE-Level-r13)) OF PRACH-ParametersCE-r13\n\nPRACH-ParametersCE-r13 ::=\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\nprach-ConfigIndex-r13\t\t\t\t\tINTEGER (0..63),\nprach-FreqOffset-r13\t\t\t\t\t\tINTEGER (0..94),\nprach-StartingSubframe-r13\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {sf2, sf4, sf8, sf16, sf32, sf64, sf128,\nsf256}\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need OP\nmaxNumPreambleAttemptCE-r13\nENUMERATED {n3, n4, n5, n6, n7, n8, n10}\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need OP\nnumRepetitionPerPreambleAttempt-r13\t\tENUMERATED {n1,n2,n4,n8,n16,n32,n64,n128},\nmpdcch-NarrowbandsToMonitor-r13\t\t\tSEQUENCE (SIZE(1..2)) OF\nINTEGER (1..maxAvailNarrowBands-r13),\nmpdcch-NumRepetition-RA-r13\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {r1, r2, r4, r8, r16,\nr32, r64, r128, r256},\nprach-HoppingConfig-r13\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {on,off}\n}\n\nEDT-PRACH-ParametersCE-r15 ::=\t\tSEQUENCE {\nedt-PRACH-ParametersCE-r15\t\tSEQUENCE {\nprach-ConfigIndex-r15\t\t\t\tINTEGER (0..63),\nprach-FreqOffset-r15\t\t\t\t\tINTEGER (0..94),\nprach-StartingSubframe-r15\t\t\tENUMERATED {sf2, sf4, sf8, sf16, sf32, sf64, sf128, sf256}\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need OP\nmpdcch-NarrowbandsToMonitor-r15\t\tSEQUENCE (SIZE(1..2)) OF INTEGER (1..maxAvailNarrowBands-r13)\n}\tOPTIONAL -- Need OR\n}\n\nRSRP-ThresholdsPrachInfoList-r13 ::= SEQUENCE (SIZE(1..3)) OF RSRP-Range\n\nPRACH-TxDuration-r17::=\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\nprach-TxDuration-r17\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {n1, n2, n4, n8, n16, n32, n64, n128}\n}\n\n-- ASN1STOP\n\n\n\n\nThe IE PresenceAntennaPort1 is used to indicate whether all the neighbouring cells use Antenna Port 1.

Consequently, AS need not provide \"man-in-the-middle\" protection for the security capabilities.\nNOTE 2:\tThe column FDD/ TDD diff indicates if the UE is allowed to signal, as part of the additional capabilities for an XDD mode i.e. within UE-EUTRA-CapabilityAddXDD-Mode-xNM, a different value compared to the value signalled elsewhere within UE-EUTRA-Capability (i.e. the common value, supported for both XDD modes). A '-' is used to indicate that it is not possible to signal different values (used for fields for which the field description is provided for other reasons). Annex E specifies for which TDD and FDD serving cells a UE supporting TDD/FDD CA shall support a capability for which it indicates support within the capability signalling.\nNOTE 2a:\tFrom REL-15 onwards, the UE is not allowed to signal different values for FDD and TDD unless yes is indicated in column FDD/ TDD diff (i.e. no need to introduce field description solely for the purpose of indicate no).\nNOTE 3:\tThe BandCombinationParameters for the same band combination can be included more than once.\nNOTE 4:\tUE CA and measurement capabilities indicate the combinations of frequencies that can be configured as serving frequencies.\nNOTE 5:\tThe grouping of the cells to the first and second cell group, as indicated by supportedCellGrouping, is shown in the table below. The leading / leftmost bit of supportedCellGrouping corresponds to the Bit String Position 1.\n\nNOTE 6:\tUE includes the intraBandContiguousCC-InfoList-r12 also for bandwidth class A because of the presence conditions in BandCombinationParameters-v1270. For example, if UE supports CA_1A_41D band combination, if UE includes the field intraBandContiguousCC-InfoList-r12 for band 41, the UE includes intraBandContiguousCC-InfoList-r12 also for band 1.\nNOTE 6a:\tFor multiple BandParameters entries with the same bandEUTRA and same ca-BandwidthClassDL in a supported band combination, the UE capabilities indicated by BandParameters are agnostic to the order in which they are indicated in the bandParameterList, under the condition that the set of the capabilities indicated for the concerned bandEUTRA (e.g. bandParametersDL and bandParametersUL) are used together, and the concerned BandParameters correspond to the supportedBandwithCombinationSet for which set of channel bandwidths for carrier(s) is the same among sub-blocks, as defined in TS 36.101 [42], Table 5.6A.1-3, Table 5.6A.1-4, Table 5.6A.1-5.\nNOTE 7:\tFor a UE that indicates release X in field accessStratumRelease but supports a feature specified in release X+ N (i.e. early UE implementation), the ASN.1 comprehension requirement are specified in Annex F.\nNOTE 8:\tFor a UE that does not include mimo-WeightedLayersCapabilities-r13, or for the case with no CC configured with FD-MIMO, the FD-MIMO processing capability condition is not applicable (i.e. considered as satisfied). For a UE that includes mimo-WeightedLayersCapabilities-r13, the FD-MIMO processing capability condition is satisfied if the equation 4.3.28.13-1 in TS 36.306 [5] is satisfied.\n\nThe UE-RadioPagingInfo IE contains UE capability information needed for paging.\nUE-RadioPagingInfo information element\n-- ASN1START\n\nUE-RadioPagingInfo-r12 ::=\t\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\nue-Category-v1250\t\t\t\t\t\tINTEGER (0)\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\n...,\n[[\tue-CategoryDL-v1310\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {m1}\t\tOPTIONAL,\nce-ModeA-r13\t\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {true}\tOPTIONAL,\nce-ModeB-r13\t\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {true}\tOPTIONAL\n]],\n[[\twakeUpSignal-r15\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {true}\tOPTIONAL,\nwakeUpSignal-TDD-r15\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {true}\tOPTIONAL,\nwakeUpSignalMinGap-eDRX-r15\t\t\tENUMERATED {ms40, ms240, ms1000, ms2000}\t\tOPTIONAL,\nwakeUpSignalMinGap-eDRX-TDD-r15\t\tENUMERATED {ms40, ms240, ms1000, ms2000}\t\tOPTIONAL\n]],\n[[\tue-CategoryDL-v1610\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {m2}\t\tOPTIONAL,\ngroupWakeUpSignal-r16\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {true}\tOPTIONAL,\ngroupWakeUpSignalTDD-r16\t\t\tENUMERATED {true}\tOPTIONAL,\ngroupWakeUpSignalAlternation-r16\tENUMERATED {true}\tOPTIONAL,\ngroupWakeUpSignalAlternationTDD-r16\tENUMERATED {true}\tOPTIONAL\n]],\n[[\ninactiveStatePO-Determination-r17\tENUMERATED {true}\tOPTIONAL\n]]\n}\n\n-- ASN1STOP\n\n\n\nThe IE UE-TimersAndConstants contains timers and constants used by the UE in either RRC_CONNECTED or RRC_IDLE.\nUE-TimersAndConstants information element\n-- ASN1START\n\nUE-TimersAndConstants ::=\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\nt300\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {\nms100, ms200, ms300, ms400, ms600, ms1000, ms1500,\nms2000},\nt301\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {\nms100, ms200, ms300, ms400, ms600, ms1000, ms1500,\nms2000},\nt310\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {\nms0, ms50, ms100, ms200, ms500, ms1000, ms2000},\nn310\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {\nn1, n2, n3, n4, n6, n8, n10, n20},\nt311\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {\nms1000, ms3000, ms5000, ms10000, ms15000,\nms20000, ms30000},\nn311\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {\nn1, n2, n3, n4, n5, n6, n8, n10},\n...,\n[[\tt300-v1310\t\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {\nms2500, ms3000, ms3500, ms4000, ms5000, ms6000, ms8000,\nms10000}\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need OR\nt301-v1310\t\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {\nms2500, ms3000, ms3500, ms4000, ms5000, ms6000, ms8000,\nms10000}\t\tOPTIONAL\t-- Need OR\n]],\n[[\tt310-v1330\t\t\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {ms4000, ms6000}\nOPTIONAL\t-- Need OR\n]],\n[[\tt300-r15\t\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {ms4000, ms6000, ms8000, ms10000, ms15000,\nms25000, ms40000, ms60000}\tOPTIONAL\t\t-- Cond EDTorPUR\n]]\n}\n\n-- ASN1STOP\n\n\n\nThe IE VisitedCellInfoList includes the mobility history information of maximum of 16 most recently visited cells or time spent outside E-UTRA.

'-' is used when the capability applies to one mode only, 'No' is used for dual mode capabilities where a common value is signalled for both modes, and 'Yes' is used for dual mode capabilities where a separate value is signalled for each mode.

X.691 [15].\nThe following encoding rules apply in addition to what has been specified in X.691:\n-\tWhen a bit string value is placed in a bit-field as specified in 15.6 to 15.11 in X.691, the leading bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the leading bit of the bit-field, and the trailing bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the trailing bit of the bit-field.\nNOTE:\tThe terms 'leading bit' and 'trailing bit' are defined in ITU-T Rec. X.680. When using the 'bstring' notation, the leading bit of the bit string value is on the left, and the trailing bit of the bit string value is on the right.\n-\tWhen decoding types constrained with the ASN.1 Contents Constraint (\"CONTAINING\"), automatic decoding of the contained type should not be performed because errors in the decoding of the contained type should not cause the decoding of the entire RRC message PDU to fail. It is recommended that the decoder first decodes the outer PDU type that contains the OCTET STRING or BIT STRING with the Contents Constraint, and then decodes the contained type that is nested within the OCTET STRING or BIT STRING as a separate step.\n-\tWhen decoding a) RRC message PDUs, b) BIT STRING constrained with a Contents Constraint, or c) OCTET STRING constrained with a Contents Constraint, PER decoders are required to never report an error if there are extraneous zero or non-zero bits at the end of the encoded RRC message PDU, BIT STRING or OCTET STRING.\n",

The figure showcases the various stages, including the MS sending a connection request, the base station (BS) acknowledging the request, and the MS waiting for the RRC connection to be established.

In order to facilitate the extraction of the complete ASN.1 code from the specification, each ASN.1 clause begins with a text paragraph consisting entirely of an ASN.1 start tag, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text string \"ASN1START\" (in all upper case letters). Each ASN.1 clause ends with a text paragraph consisting entirely of an ASN.1 stop tag, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text \"ASN1STOP\" (in all upper case letters):\n-- ASN1START\n\n-- ASN1STOP\n\nThe text paragraphs containing the ASN.1 start and stop tags should not contain any ASN.1 code significant for the complete description of the RRC PDU contents. The complete ASN.1 code may be extracted by copying all the text paragraphs between an ASN.1 start tag and the following ASN.1 stop tag in the order they appear, throughout the specification.\nNOTE:\tA typical procedure for extraction of the complete ASN.1 code consists of a first step where the entire RRC PDU contents description (ultimately the entire specification) is saved into a plain text (ASCII) file format, followed by a second step where the actual extraction takes place, based on the occurrence of the ASN.1 start and stop tags.\nThe naming of identifiers (i.e., the ASN.1 field and type identifiers) should be based on the following guidelines:\n-\tMessage (PDU) identifiers should be ordinary mixed case without hyphenation. These identifiers, e.g., the RRCConnectionModificationCommand, should be used for reference in the procedure text. Abbreviated forms of these identifiers should not be used.\n-\tType identifiers other than PDU identifiers should be ordinary mixed case, with hyphenation used to set off acronyms only where an adjacent letter is a capital, e.g., EstablishmentCause, SelectedPLMN (not Selected-PLMN, since the \"d\" in \"Selected\" is lowercase), InitialUE-Identity and MeasSFN-SFN-TimeDifference.\n-\tField identifiers shall start with a lowercase letter and use mixed case thereafter, e.g., establishmentCause. If a field identifier begins with an acronym (which would normally be in upper case), the entire acronym is lowercase (plmn-Identity, not pLMN-Identity). The acronym is set off with a hyphen (ue-Identity, not ueIdentity), in order to facilitate a consistent search pattern with corresponding type identifiers.\n-\tIdentifiers that are likely to be keywords of some language, especially widely used languages, such as C++ or Java, should be avoided to the extent possible.\n-\tIdentifiers, other than PDU identifiers, longer than 25 characters should be avoided where possible. It is recommended to use abbreviations, which should be done in a consistent manner i.e. use 'Meas' instead of 'Measurement' for all occurrences. Examples of typical abbreviations are given in table A.3.1.2.1-1 below.\n-\tFor future extension: When an extension is introduced a suffix is added to the identifier of the concerned ASN.1 field and/ or type. A suffix of the form \"-rX\" is used, with X indicating the release, for ASN.1 fields or types introduced in a later release (i.e. a release later than the original/ first release of the protocol) as well as for ASN.1 fields or types for which a revision is introduced in a later release replacing a previous version, e.g., Foo-r9 for the Rel-9 version of the ASN.1 type Foo. A suffix of the form \"-rXb\" is used for the first revision of a field that it appears in the same release (X) as the original version of the field, \"-rXc\" for a second intra-release revision and so on. A suffix of the form \"-vXYZ\" is used for ASN.1 fields or types that only are an extension of a corresponding earlier field or type (see clause A.4), e.g., AnElement-v10b0 for the extension of the ASN.1 type AnElement introduced in version 10.11.0 of the specification. A number 0...9, 10, 11, etc. is used to represent the first part of the version number, indicating the release of the protocol. Lower case letters a, b, c, etc. are used to represent the second (and third) part of the version number if they are greater than 9. In the procedural specification, in field descriptions as well as in headings suffices are not used, unless there is a clear need to distinguish the extension from the original field.\n-\tMore generally, in case there is a need to distinguish different variants of an ASN.1 field or IE, a suffix should be added at the end of the identifiers e.g. MeasObjectUTRA, ConfigCommon. When there is no particular need to distinguish the fields (e.g. because the field is included in different IEs), a common field identifier name may be used. This may be attractive e.g. in case the procedural specification is the same for the different variants.\nTable A.3.1.2-1: Examples of typical abbreviations used in ASN.1 identifiers\n\nNOTE:\t\tThe table A.3.1.2.1-1 is not exhaustive. Additional abbreviations may be used in ASN.1 identifiers when needed.\nA text reference into the RRC PDU contents description from other parts of the specification is made using the ASN.1 field or type identifier of the referenced element. The ASN.1 field and type identifiers used in text references should be in the italic font style. The \"do not check spelling and grammar\" attribute in Word should be set. Quotation marks (i.e., \" \") should not be used around the ASN.1 field or type identifier.\nA reference to an RRC PDU type should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 type identifier followed by the word \"message\", e.g., a reference to the RRCConnectionRelease message.\nA reference to a specific part of an RRC PDU, or to a specific part of any other ASN.1 type, should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 field identifier followed by the word \"field\", e.g., a reference to the prioritisedBitRate field in the example below.\n-- /example/ ASN1START\n\nLogicalChannelConfig ::=\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\nul-SpecificParameters\t\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\npriority\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPriority,\nprioritisedBitRate\t\t\t\t\tPrioritisedBitRate,\nbucketSizeDuration\t\t\t\t\tBucketSizeDuration,\nlogicalChannelGroup\t\t\t\t\tINTEGER (0..3)\n}\t\tOPTIONAL\n}\n\n-- ASN1STOP\n\nNOTE:\tAll the ASN.1 start tags in the ASN.1 clauses, used as examples in this annex to the specification, are deliberately distorted, in order not to include them when the ASN.1 description of the RRC PDU contents is extracted from the specification.\nA reference to a specific type of information element should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 type identifier preceded by the acronym \"IE\", e.g., a reference to the IE LogicalChannelConfig in the example above.\nReferences to a specific type of information element should only be used when those are generic, i.e., without regard to the particular context wherein the specific type of information element is used. If the reference is related to a particular context, e.g., an RRC PDU type (message) wherein the information element is used, the corresponding field identifier in that context should be used in the text reference.\nA reference to a specific value of an ASN.1 field should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 value without using quotation marks around the ASN.1 value, e.g., 'if the status field is set to value true'.\n",

How these hooks are used is further described in clause A.4.\nCritical extensions are characterised by a redefinition of the PDU contents and need to be governed by a mechanism for protocol version agreement between the encoder and the decoder of the PDU, such that the encoder is prevented from sending a critically extended version of the PDU type, which is not comprehended by the decoder.\nCritical extension of a PDU type is facilitated by a two-level CHOICE structure, where the alternative PDU contents are alternatives within the inner level c1 CHOICE. Spare alternatives (i.e., spare3 down to spare1 in this case) may be included within the c1 CHOICE. The number of spare alternatives to be included in the original PDU specification should be decided case by case, based on the expected rate of critical extension in the future releases of the protocol.\nFurther critical extension, when the spare alternatives from the original specifications are used up, is facilitated using the criticalExtensionsFuture in the outer level CHOICE.\nIn PDU types where critical extension is not expected in the future releases of the protocol, the inner level c1 CHOICE and the spare alternatives may be excluded, as shown in the example below.\n-- /example/ ASN1START\n\nRRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete ::= SEQUENCE {\nrrc-TransactionIdentifier\t\t\tRRC-TransactionIdentifier,\ncriticalExtensions\t\t\t\t\tCHOICE {\nrrcConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8\nRRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs,\ncriticalExtensionsFuture\t\t\tSEQUENCE {}\n}\n}\n\nRRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {\n-- Enter the IEs here. --\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-- Cond condTag\n...\n}\n\n-- ASN1STOP\n\nNon-critical extensions are characterised by the addition of new information to the original specification of the PDU type. If not comprehended, a non-critical extension may be skipped by the decoder, whilst the decoder is still able to complete the decoding of the comprehended parts of the PDU contents.\nNon-critical extensions at locations other than the end of the message or other than at the end of a field contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING are facilitated by use of the ASN.1 extension marker \"...\". The original specification of a PDU type should normally include the extension marker at the end of the sequence of information elements contained.\nNon-critical extensions at the end of the message or at the end of a field that is contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING are facilitated by use of an empty sequence that is marked OPTIONAL e.g. as shown in the following example:\n-- /example/ ASN1START\n\nRRCMessage-r8-IEs ::=\t\t\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\nfield1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInformationElement1,\nfield2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInformationElement2,\nnonCriticalExtension\t\t\t\t\tSEQUENCE {}\t\t\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL\n}\n\n-- ASN1STOP\n\nThe ASN.1 clause specifying the contents of a PDU type may be followed by a field description table where a further description of, e.g., the semantic properties of the fields may be included. The general format of this table is shown in the example below. The field description table is absent in case there are no fields for which further description needs to be provided e.g. because the PDU does not include any fields, or because an IE is defined for each field while there is nothing specific regarding the use of this IE that needs to be specified.\n\nThe field description table has one column.

Each row shall include a first paragraph with a field identifier (in bold and italic font style) referring to the part of the PDU to which it applies. The following paragraphs at the same row may include (in regular font style), e.g., semantic description, references to other specifications and/ or specification of value units, which are relevant for the particular part of the PDU.\nThe parts of the PDU contents that do not require a field description shall be omitted from the field description table.\n",

IEs may also be defined for other reasons e.g. to break down a ASN.1 definition in to smaller pieces.\nA group of closely related IE type definitions, like the IEs PRACH-ConfigSIB and PRACH-Config in this example, are preferably placed together in a common ASN.1 clause. The IE type identifiers should in this case have a common base, defined as the generic type identifier. It may be complemented by a suffix to distinguish the different variants. The \"PRACH-Config\" is the generic type identifier in this example, and the \"SIB\" suffix is added to distinguish the variant. The clause heading and generic references to a group of closely related IEs defined in this way should use the generic type identifier.\nThe same principle should apply if a new version, or an extension version, of an existing IE is created for critical or non-critical extension of the protocol (see clause A.4). The new version, or the extension version, of the IE is included in the same ASN.1 clause defining the original. A suffix is added to the type identifier, using the naming conventions defined in clause A.3.1.2, indicating the release or version of the where the new version, or extension version, was introduced.\nLocal IE type definitions, like the IE PRACH-ConfigInfo in the example above, may be included in the ASN.1 clause and be referenced in the other IE types defined in the same ASN.1 clause. The use of locally defined IE types should be encouraged, as a tool to break up large and complex IE type definitions. It can improve the readability of the code. There may also be a benefit for the software implementation of the protocol end-points, as these IE types are typically provided by the ASN.1 compiler as independent data elements, to be used in the software implementation.\nAn IE type defined in a local context, like the IE PRACH-ConfigInfo, should not be referenced directly from other ASN.1 clauses in the RRC specification. An IE type which is referenced in more than one ASN.1 clause should be defined in a separate clause, with a separate heading and a separate ASN.1 clause (possibly as one in a set of closely related IE types, like the IEs PRACH-ConfigSIB and PRACH-Config in the example above). Such IE types are also referred to as 'global IEs'.\nNOTE:\tReferring to an IE type, that is defined as a local IE type in the context of another ASN.1 clause, does not generate an ASN.1 compilation error. Nevertheless, using a locally defined IE type in that way makes the IE type definition difficult to find, as it would not be visible at an outline level of the specification. It should be avoided.\nThe ASN.1 clause specifying the contents of one or more IE types, like in the example above, may be followed by a field description table, where a further description of, e.g., the semantic properties of the fields of the information elements may be included. This table may be absent, similar as indicated in clause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type. The general format of the field description table is the same as shown in clause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type.\n",

The \"-rX-IEs\" structures contain the complete structure of the message IEs for the appropriate release; i.e., the critical extension branch for the Rel-10 version of a message includes all Rel-8 and Rel-9 fields (that are not obviated in the later version), rather than containing only the additional Rel-10 fields.\nThe following guidelines may be used when deciding which mechanism to introduce for a particular message, i.e. only an 'outer branch', or an 'outer branch' in combination with an 'inner branch' including a certain number of spares:\n-\tFor certain messages, e.g. initial uplink messages, messages transmitted on a broadcast channel, critical extension may not be applicable.\n-\tAn outer branch may be sufficient for messages not including any fields.\n-\tThe number of spares within inner branch should reflect the likelihood that the message will be critically extended in future releases (since each release with a critical extension for the message consumes one of the spare values).

W.r.t. the use of extension markers, the following additional guidelines apply:\n-\tWhen further non-critical extensions are added to a message that has been critically extended, the inclusion of these non-critical extensions in earlier critical branches of the message should be avoided when possible.\n-\tThe extension marker (\"…\") is the primary non-critical extension mechanism that is used unless a length determinant is not required. Examples of cases where a length determinant is not required:\n-\tat the end of a message,\n-\tat the end of a structure contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING\n-\tWhen an extension marker is available, non-critical extensions are preferably placed at the location (e.g. the IE) where the concerned parameter belongs from a logical/ functional perspective (referred to as the 'default extension location')\n-\tIt is desirable to aggregate extensions of the same release or version of the specification into a group, which should be placed at the lowest possible level.\n-\tIn specific cases it may be preferrable to place extensions elsewhere (referred to as the 'actual extension location') e.g. when it is possible to aggregate several extensions in a group. In such a case, the group should be placed at the lowest suitable level in the message.\n-\tIn case placement at the default extension location affects earlier critical branches of the message, locating the extension at a following higher level in the message should be considered.\n-\tIn case an extension is not placed at the default extension location, an IE should be defined. The IE's ASN.1 definition should be placed in the same ASN.1 clause as the default extension location. In case there are intermediate levels in-between the actual and the default extension location, an IE may be defined for each level. Intermediate levels are primarily introduced for readability and overview. Hence intermediate levels need not allways be introduced e.g. they may not be needed when the default and the actual extension location are within the same ASN.1 clause.\nFurther to the general principles defined in the previous clause, the following additional guidelines apply regarding the use of extension markers:\n-\tExtension markers within SEQUENCE\n-\tExtension markers are primarily, but not exclusively, introduced at the higher nesting levels\n-\tExtension markers are introduced for a SEQUENCE comprising several fields as well as for information elements whose extension would result in complex structures without it (e.g. re-introducing another list)\n-\tExtension markers are introduced to make it possible to maintain important information structures e.g. parameters relevant for one particular RAT\n-\tExtension markers are also used for size critical messages (i.e. messages on BCCH, BR-BCCH, PCCH and CCCH), although introduced somewhat more carefully\n-\tThe extension fields introduced (or frozen) in a specific version of the specification are grouped together using double brackets.\n-\tExtension markers within ENUMERATED\n-\tSpare values are used until the number of values reaches the next power of 2, while the extension marker caters for extension beyond that limit\n-\tA suffix of the form \"vXYZ\" is used for the identifier of each new value, e.g. \"value-vXYZ\".\n-\tExtension markers within CHOICE:\n-\tExtension markers are introduced when extension is foreseen and when comprehension is not required by the receiver i.e. behaviour is defined for the case where the receiver cannot comprehend the extended value (e.g. ignoring an optional CHOICE field). It should be noted that defining the behaviour of a receiver upon receiving a not comprehended choice value is not required if the sender is aware whether or not the receiver supports the extended value.\n-\tA suffix of the form \"vXYZ\" is used for the identifier of each new choice value, e.g. \"choice-vXYZ\".\nNon-critical extensions at the end of a message/ of a field contained in an OCTET or BIT STRING:\n-\tWhen a nonCriticalExtension is actually used, a \"Need\" statement should not be provided for the field, which always is a group including at least one extension and a field facilitating further possible extensions. For simplicity, it is recommended not to provide a \"Need\" statement when the field is not actually used either.\nFurther, more general, guidelines:\n-\tIn case a need statement is not provided for a group, a \"Need\" statement is provided for all individual extension fields within the group i.e. including for fields that are not marked as OPTIONAL. The latter is to clarify the action upon absence of the whole group.\nThe following example illustrates the use of the extension marker for a number of elementary cases (sequence, enumerated, choice). The example also illustrates how the IE may be revised in case the critical extension mechanism is used.\nNOTE\tIn case there is a need to support further extensions of release n while the ASN.1 of release (n+1) has been frozen, without requiring the release n receiver to support decoding of release (n+1) extensions, more advanced mechanisms are needed e.g. including multiple extension markers.\n-- /example/ ASN1START\n\nInformationElement1 ::=\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\nfield1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {\nvalue1, value2, value3, value4-v880,\n..., value5-v960 },\nfield2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCHOICE {\nfield2a\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBOOLEAN,\nfield2b\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInformationElement2b,\n...,\nfield2c-v960\t\t\t\t\t\tInformationElement2c-r9\n},\n...,\n[[\tfield3-r9\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInformationElement3-r9\t\tOPTIONAL\t\t-- Need OR\n]],\n[[\tfield3-v9a0\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInformationElement3-v9a0\tOPTIONAL,\t\t-- Need OR\nfield4-r9\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInformationElement4\t\t\tOPTIONAL\t\t-- Need OR\n]]\n}\n\nInformationElement1-r10 ::=\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\nfield1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {\nvalue1, value2, value3, value4-v880,\nvalue5-v960, value6-v1170, spare2, spare1, ... },\nfield2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCHOICE {\nfield2a\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBOOLEAN,\nfield2b\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInformationElement2b,\nfield2c-v960\t\t\t\t\t\tInformationElement2c-r9,\n...,\nfield2d-v12b0\t\t\t\t\t\tINTEGER (0..63)\n},\nfield3-r9\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInformationElement3-r10\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need OR\nfield4-r9\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInformationElement4\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need OR\nfield5-r10\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBOOLEAN,\nfield6-r10\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInformationElement6-r10\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need OR\n...,\n[[\tfield3-v1170\t\t\t\t\t\tInformationElement3-v1170\t\tOPTIONAL\t-- Need OR\n]]\n}\n\n-- ASN1STOP\n\nSome remarks regarding the extensions of InformationElement1 as shown in the above example:\n–\tThe InformationElement1 is initially extended with a number of non-critical extensions. In release 10 however, a critical extension is introduced for the message using this IE. Consequently, a new version of the IE InformationElement1 (i.e. InformationElement1-r10) is defined in which the earlier non-critical extensions are incorporated by means of a revision of the original field.\n–\tThe value4-v880 is replacing a spare value defined in the original protocol version for field1. Likewise value6-v1170 replaces spare3 that was originally defined in the r10 version of field1\n–\tWithin the critically extended release 10 version of InformationElement1, the names of the original fields/ IEs are not changed, unless there is a real need to distinguish them from other fields/ IEs. E.g. the field1 and InformationElement4 were defined in the original protocol version (release 8) and hence not tagged. Moreover, the field3-r9 is introduced in release 9 and not re-tagged; although, the InformationElement3 is also critically extended and therefore tagged InformationElement3-r10 in the release 10 version of InformationElement1.\nThe following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions at the end of the message or at the end of a field that is contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING i.e. when an empty sequence is used.\n-- /example/ ASN1START\n\nRRCMessage-r8-IEs ::=\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\nfield1\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInformationElement1,\nfield2\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInformationElement2,\nfield3\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInformationElement3\t\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need ON\nnonCriticalExtension\t\t\tRRCMessage-v860-IEs\t\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL\n}\n\nRRCMessage-v860-IEs ::=\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\nfield4-v860\t\t\t\t\t\tInformationElement4\t\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need OP\nfield5-v860\t\t\t\t\t\tBOOLEAN\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Cond C54\nnonCriticalExtension\t\t\tRRCMessage-v940-IEs\t\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL\n}\n\nRRCMessage-v940-IEs ::=\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\nfield6-v940\t\t\t\t\t\tInformationElement6-r9\t\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need OR\nnonCriticalExtensions\t\t\tSEQUENCE {}\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL\n}\n\n-- ASN1STOP\n\nSome remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:\n–\tThe InformationElement4 is introduced in the original version of the protocol (release 8) and hence no suffix is used.\nThe following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions in case an extension is not placed at the default extension location.\nThe IE ParentIE-WithEM is an example of a high level IE including the extension marker (EM). The root encoding of this IE includes two lower level IEs ChildIE1-WithoutEM and ChildIE2-WithoutEM which not include the extension marker. Consequently, non-critical extensions of the Child-IEs have to be included at the level of the Parent-IE.\nThe example illustrates how the two extension IEs ChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0 and ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0 (both in release N) are used to connect non-critical extensions with a default extension location in the lower level IEs to the actual extension location in this IE.\nParentIE-WithEM information element\n-- /example/ ASN1START\n\nParentIE-WithEM ::=\t\t\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\n-- Root encoding, including:\nchildIE1-WithoutEM\t\t\t\t\tChildIE1-WithoutEM\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t\t-- Need ON\nchildIE2-WithoutEM\t\t\t\t\tChildIE2-WithoutEM\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t\t-- Need ON\n...,\n[[\tchildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0\t\t\t\tChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0\t\tOPTIONAL,\t\t-- Need ON\nchildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0\t\t\t\tChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0\t\tOPTIONAL\t\t-- Need ON\n]]\n}\n\n-- ASN1STOP\n\nSome remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:\n–\tThe fields childIEx-WithoutEM-vNx0 may not really need to be optional (depends on what is defined at the next lower level).\n–\tIn general, especially when there are several nesting levels, fields should be marked as optional only when there is a clear reason.\n\nThe IE ChildIE1-WithoutEM is an example of a lower level IE, used to control certain radio configurations including a configurable feature which can be setup or released using the local IE ChIE1-ConfigurableFeature. The example illustrates how the new field chIE1-NewField is added in release N to the configuration of the configurable feature. The example is based on the following assumptions:\n–\twhen initially configuring as well as when modifying the new field, the original fields of the configurable feature have to be provided also i.e. as if the extended ones were present within the setup branch of this feature.\n–\twhen the configurable feature is released, the new field should be released also.\n–\twhen omitting the original fields of the configurable feature the UE continues using the existing values (which is used to optimise the signalling for features that typically continue unchanged upon handover).\n–\twhen omitting the new field of the configurable feature the UE releases the existing values and discontinues the associated functionality (which may be used to support release of unsupported functionality upon handover to an eNB supporting an earlier protocol version).\nThe above assumptions, which affect the use of conditions and need codes, may not always apply. Hence, the example should not be re-used blindly.\nChildIE1-WithoutEM information elements\n-- /example/ ASN1START\n\nChildIE1-WithoutEM ::=\t\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\n-- Root encoding, including:\nchIE1-ConfigurableFeature\t\t\tChIE1-ConfigurableFeature\t\tOPTIONAL\t\t-- Need ON\n}\n\nChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0 ::=\t\tSEQUENCE {\nchIE1-ConfigurableFeature-vNx0\t\tChIE1-ConfigurableFeature-vNx0\tOPTIONAL\t-- Cond ConfigF\n}\n\nChIE1-ConfigurableFeature ::=\t\tCHOICE {\nrelease\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNULL,\nsetup\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSEQUENCE {\n-- Root encoding\n}\n}\n\nChIE1-ConfigurableFeature-vNx0 ::=\tSEQUENCE {\nchIE1-NewField-rN\t\t\t\t\tINTEGER (0..31)\n}\n\n-- ASN1STOP\n\n\nThe IE ChildIE2-WithoutEM is an example of a lower level IE, typically used to control certain radio configurations.

The figure provides a visual representation of the relationship between these blocks and the corresponding frequency bands, allowing for efficient resource allocation and management in the telecommunication industry. The mapping is crucial for ensuring that different services do not interfere with each other and that the available spectrum is used optimally.\nFigure D.1.2-1: Mapping of EARFCNs to MultiBandInfoList/MultiBandInfoList-v9e0\n",

In this example:\n-\tE-UTRAN includes 4 UTRA FDD frequencies (UARFCNs).\n-\tThe bands associated with f1 and f4 have no overlapping bands. The band associated with f2 has two overlapping bands, B1 and B2. The band associated with f3 has one overlapping band, B3.\n-\tE-UTRAN includes 4 lists in carrierFreqListUTRA-FDD-v8h0 with the first and fourth entry not including MultiBandInfoList.\nFigure D.1.3-1 illustrates the mapping of Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter Control Channel (UARFCN) numbers to the MultiBandInfoList, providing a detailed overview of the frequency bands and corresponding UARFCN assignments in a telecommunication system. The figure showcases a structured approach to managing and organizing the various frequency bands, ensuring efficient communication and minimizing interference. The UARFCN numbers are systematically arranged, allowing for easy identification and utilization of the designated bands for specific applications. This mapping is crucial for network planning, optimization, and troubleshooting, as it enables operators to understand and navigate the complex spectrum landscape effectively.\nFigure D.1.3-1: Mapping of UARFCNs to MultiBandInfoList\nAnnex E specifies for which TDD and FDD serving cells a UE supporting TDD/FDD CA shall support a feature/capability for which it indicates support within the FGI/capability signalling.\nA UE that indicates support for TDD/ FDD CA:\n-\tFor the fields for which the UE is allowed to indicate different\tsupport for FDD and TDD, the UE shall support the feature on the PCell and/or SCell(s), as specified in tables E-1, E-2 and E-3 in accordance to the following rules:\n-\tPCell: the UE shall support the feature for the PCell, if the UE indicates support of the feature for the PCell duplex mode;\n-\tSCell: the UE shall support the feature for SCell(s), if the UE indicates support of the feature for the SCell duplex mode;\n-\tPer serving cell: the UE shall support the feature for a serving cell if the UE indicates support of the feature for the serving cell's duplex mode;\n-\tAll serving cells: UE shall support the feature if the UE indicates support of the feature for both TDD and FDD duplex modes;\n-\tFor the fields where the UE is not allowed to indicate different support for FDD and TDD, the UE shall support the feature for PCell and SCell(s) if the UE indicates support of the feature via the common FGI/capability bit.\nTable E-1: Rel-8/9 FGIs for which FDD/TDD differentiation is allowed (from Annex B)\n\nTable E-2: Rel-10 FGIs for which FDD/TDD differentiation is allowed (from Annex C)\n\nTable E-3: Rel-12 UE-EUTRA capabilities for which FDD/TDD differentiation is allowed\n\nThis clause specifies UE requirements regarding the ASN.1 transfer syntax support i.e. the ASN.1 definitions to be comprehended by the UE.\nA UE that indicates release X in field accessStratumRelease shall comprehend the entire transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release X, in particular at least the first version upon ASN.1 freeze. The UE is however not required to support dedicated signalling related transfer syntax associated with optional features it does not support.\nIn case a UE that indicates release X in field accessStratumRelease supports a feature specified in release X+ N (i.e. early UE implementation) additional requirements apply.\nCricitical extensions (dedicated signaling)\nIf the early implemented feature involves one or more critical extensions (i.e. case of dedicated signaling), the UE shall comprehend the parts of the transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release X+ N that are related to the feature implemented early. This in particular concerns the ASN.1 parts related to configuration of the feature. The UE obviously also has to support the ASN.1 parts related to indicating support of the feature (in UE capabilities).\nIf configuration of an early implemented feature introduced in release X+ N involves a message or field that has been critically extended, the UE shall support configuration of all features supported by the UE that are associated with sub-fields of this critical extension. Apart from the early implemented feature(s), the UE need however not support functionality beyond what is defined in the release the UE indicates in access stratum release.\nLet's consider the example of a UE indicating value X in field accessStratumRelease that supports the features associated with fields A1, A3 and A5 of InformationElementA (see ASN.1 below). The feature implemented early is associated with field A5, and can only be configured by the –rX+N version of InformationElementA. In such case, the UE should support configuration of the features associated with fields A1, A3 and A5 by the –rX+N version of InformationElementA. If however one of the features was modified, e.g. the feature associated with fieldA3, E-UTRAN should assume the UE only supports the feature according to the release it indicated in field accessStratumRelease (X). I.e. UE is neither required to support the additional code-point (n80-vX+N0) nor the additional sub-field (fieldA3a).\nInformationElementA-rX ::=\t\tSEQUENCE {\nfieldA1-rX\t\t\t\t\t\tInformationElementA1-rX\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need ON\nfieldA2-rX\t\t\t\t\t\tInformationElementA2-rX\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need OR\nfieldA3-rX\t\t\t\t\t\tInformationElementA3-rX\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL\t-- Need OR\n}\n\nInformationElementA-rX+N ::=\tSEQUENCE {\nfieldA1-rX+N\t\t\t\t\tInformationElementA1-rX\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need ON\nfieldA2-rX+N\t\t\t\t\tInformationElementA2-rX\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need OR\nfieldA3-rX+N\t\t\t\t\tInformationElementA3-rX+N\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need OR\nfieldA4-rX+N\t\t\t\t\tInformationElementA4-rX+N\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need OR\nfieldA5-rX+N\t\t\t\t\tInformationElementA5-rX+N\t\t\tOPTIONAL\t-- Need OR\n}\n\nInformationElementA3-rX+N ::=\tSEQUENCE {\nfieldA1a-rX+N\t\t\t\t\tInformationElementA1a-rX\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need ON\nfieldA2a-rX+N\t\t\t\t\tENUMERATED {n10, n20, n40,\nn80-vX+N0}\t\t\t\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need OR\nfieldA3a-rX+N\t\t\t\t\tInformationElementA3a-rX+N\t\t\tOPTIONAL\t-- Need OR\n}\n\nNon-cricitical extensions (broadcast signaling)\nIf the early implemented feature involves one or more non-critical extensions in broadcast signaling (i.e. system information), the UE shall comprehend the parts of the transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release X+ N that are related to the feature implemented early. The SIB(s) containing the release X+ N fields related to the early implemented features may also include other extensions concerning releases from X upto X+N. The UE shall comprehend such intermediate fields (but again is not required to support the functionality associated with these intermediate fields, in case this concerns optional features not supported by the UE).\nThis annex lists the Change Requests (CRs) whose changes may be implemented by a UE of an earlier release than which the CR was approved in (i.e. CRs that contain on their coversheets the sentence \"Implementation of this CR from Rel-N will not cause interoperability issues\").\nTable G-1: List of CRs Containing Early Implementable Features and Corrections\n\n\n\n",
