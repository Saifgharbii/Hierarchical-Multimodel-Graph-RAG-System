            "description": "5G aims to accelerate industrial transformation and digitalization, which improve flexibility, enhance productivity and efficiency, reduce maintenance, and improve operational safety. Industrial sensors play an important role for realizing such a vision. Not only widely used in industrial automation and digitalization use cases, industrial sensors are also widely used in the general environmental monitoring use cases such as monitoring of critical infrastructure (e.g., buildings, bridges, water dams, etc.) or monitoring for natural disasters (e.g., wild fire, flood, tsunami, earthquake, etc.).\nAnother emerging new class of new 5G use cases is the smart city vertical, which covers data collection and processing to more efficiently monitor and control city resources, and to provide services to city residents. Especially, the deployment of surveillance cameras is an essential part of the smart city but also of factories and industries.\nFurthermore, there have been increasing interests in wearables use cases such as smart watches, eHealth related devices, and medical monitoring devices. These use cases call for different design considerations and have different requirements in terms of form factor, UE complexity and energy efficiency, compared to eMBB devices.\nThe support of industrial sensors, video surveillance, and wearables were the motivations behind Rel-17 RedCap. Through the Rel-17 NR RedCap work item, 3GPP has established a framework for enabling reduced capability NR devices suitable for a range of use cases, including the industrial sensors, video surveillance, and wearables use cases, with requirements on low UE complexity and sometimes also on low UE power consumption.\nNow when the foundation has been laid in Rel-17 [3], enhancements can be considered to improve the support for the mentioned use cases and also to expand RedCap into a new range of use cases such as smart grid.\nTo further expand the market for RedCap use cases with relatively low cost, low energy consumption, and low data rate requirements, e.g., industrial wireless sensor network use cases, some further complexity reduction enhancements should be considered.\nRel-18 RedCap should provide NR support for low-tier devices between existing LPWA UEs and the capabilities of Rel-17 RedCap UEs. The supported peak data rate for Rel-18 RedCap targets to 10Mbps. Rel-18 RedCap should not overlap with existing LPWA solutions.\nThe enhancements should be introduced while maintaining the integrity of the RedCap ecosystem and maximizing the benefit of economies of scale. The SI targets enhancements applicable to the RedCap framework defined in Rel-17, including principles of network awareness of device capabilities.\n",

For complexity reduction estimation, the detailed complexity breakdown for the Rel-15 reference NR devices according to Table 6.1-1 is reused, where the RF-to-baseband complexity ratio is assumed to be 40:60 for an FR1 UE.\nFor comparison with a Rel-17 baseline when evaluating the potential Rel-18 UE complexity reduction features, the Rel-17 RedCap UE supports 20 MHz, 1 Rx, 1 layer, DL 64QAM, UL 64QAM, FDD or TDD. In addition, cases with 2 Rx, 2 MIMO layers, and HD-FDD features are optionally evaluated. In all comparisons, the Rel-17 RedCap UEs and the potential Rel-18 UEs being compared have the same number of antenna branches, the same number of layers, the same maximum supported modulation order, and the same duplex mode (among HD-FDD, FD-FDD, and TDD).\nNOTE: This study assesses, from a 3GPP standpoint, the technical feasibility of further reducing the complexity of RedCap devices. Given that factors outside 3GPP responsibility influence the cost of a modem/device, this study item (and this study report) cannot guarantee, or be used as a guarantee, that such modem/device will be low-cost in the market.\nTable 6.1-1: Detailed complexity breakdown for the FR1 reference NR devices\n\n",

Sourcing companies can additionally provide evaluation results of other channels and messages such as PDCCH USS, PRACH, Msg2, Msg3, Msg4, PDSCH, PUCCH and PUSCH.\nThe impact of small form factor can be considered for all the uplink and downlink channels. To reflect such an impact, a 3dB loss of antenna gain can be optionally included in link budget calculation for the FR1 bands by sourcing companies.\nThe assumptions in the Rel-17 RedCap SI regarding link budget templates and antenna array gain are reused [5]. Furthermore, the Rel-17 RedCap SI assumptions on gNB antenna configuration, # gNB Tx and Rx chains, channel model and delay spread are reused as shown in Table 6.2-1.\nTable 6.2-1: Assumptions used for coverage impact evaluation\n\nFor coverage evaluation, the assumptions for reference NR UE, reference Rel-17 RedCap UE, and the potential Rel-18 UE are shown in Tables 6.2-2, 6.2-3 and 6.2-4, respectively.\nTable 6.2-2: Assumptions for reference NR UE\n\nTable 6.2-3: Assumptions for reference Rel-17 RedCap UE\n\nTable 6.2-4: Assumptions for the potential Rel-18 UE\n\nThe assumptions for channel specific parameters are also based on reusing the Rel-17 RedCap SI agreements [5], with the revision or addition described below.\nFor PBCH, the assumptions listed in Table A.1-8 from TR 38.830 [6] were adopted for reference NR UE, reference Rel-17 RedCap UE, and the potential Rel-18 UE.\nFor SIB1, the assumptions listed in Table 6.2-5 were adopted for reference NR UE, and reference Rel-17 RedCap UE.

The \"bottleneck channel\" is the physical channel that has the lowest MIL value. The reference UE is an NR UE with mandatory features only as defined in Clause 6.1 of [5].\nIn this coverage impact evaluation in terms of coverage margins, a single coverage target based on the same bottleneck channel is used for all channels including the prioritized broadcast channels and optionally evaluated channels of the potential Rel-18 UE. Each sourcing company reports a sourcing-company-specific coverage margin for each channel by comparing the link budget of the channel with the link budget of the bottleneck channel for the reference UE.\nA representative value of the coverage margin for a channel is derived by taking the mean value (in dB domain) from the coverage margins from all sourcing companies, including both negative and non-negative values based on the following adjustments.\n-\tExcluding the highest & the lowest values when the number of samples is more than 3.\n-\tIf the number of samples is less than 4 for a channel in a scenario, no representative value is provided.\nThe representative value of a channel is used for identifying whether the channel has coverage margin compared to the bottleneck channel of the reference NR UE.\nIn Step 2 in the above methodology for determining coverage margins, a sourcing company might not be able to identify a bottleneck channel for the reference NR UE and the corresponding MIL link budget if it had not evaluated all channels for the reference NR UE, especially if it had not evaluated uplink channels since uplink channels were often the bottleneck channels for the reference NR UE. For such a sourcing company, a bottleneck channel and the corresponding link budget for the reference NR UE can be determined based on evaluation results of the identified bottleneck channels and MIL values from the Rel-17 RedCap SI in [5] for a scenario. Specifically, for an evaluated scenario, a bottleneck channel is determined by the one identified by most sourcing companies and its corresponding MIL value is derived by taking the mean value (in dB domain) from the MIL values from all sourcing companies after excluding the highest & the lowest values. For the evaluated scenarios, the following tables from Rel-17 RedCap SI in [5] are used:\n-\tFor Urban scenario at 2.6GHz, Table 9.1.1-1 in [5] is used for determining a bottleneck channel and MIL value for the reference NR UE by such a sourcing company.\n-\tFor Rural scenario at 0.7GHz, Table 9.1.2-1 in [5] is used.\n-\tFor Urban scenario at 4 GHz, Table 9.1.3-1 in [5] is used.\nFor each table of coverage margins of evaluated channels in a deployment scenario shown in Clause 8.2.1 through Clause 8.2.3, the rows of the table are composed of sourcing companies' names, representative value 1, number of samples 1, representative value 2, and number of samples 2. For an evaluated channel in the scenario,\n-\tthe representative value 1 is derived from the coverage margins only from sourcing companies who had provided uplink coverage evaluation results for the reference NR UE\n-\tthe number of samples 1 is the total number of sourcing companies that had provided uplink coverage evaluation results for the reference NR UE\n-\tthe representative value 2 is derived from the coverage margins from all sourcing companies regardless of whether or one had provided uplink coverage evaluation results for the reference NR UE\n-\tthe number of samples 2 is the total number of all sourcing companies\nBesides comparing link budgets of all evaluated channels to that of the bottleneck channel for the reference NR UE and deriving coverage margins for all channels, comparisons of the coverage differences between the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference NR UE in addition to comparisons of the coverage differences between the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference Rel-17 RedCap UE were carried out for the broadcast channels including PBCH, PDCCH CSS, and SIB1 in Urban scenario at 2.6 GHz. For PDCCH CSS and SIB1, the comparisons were also carried out for Rural scenario at 0.7 GHz. Detailed comparisons and assumptions are provided in Clause 8.2.1 and Clause 8.2.2 for Urban at 2.6 GHz and Rural at 0.7 GHz, respectively.\n",

For every sourcing-company result, the coverage margin for each channel that has MIL below the bottleneck channel for the reference NR UE is highlighted in red.\nThe representative value 1, number of samples 1, representative value 2, and number of samples 2 in the last four rows of Table 8.2.1-2 and Table 8.2.1-3 are determined according to the methodology described in clause 6.2. A negative representative value for a channel of the potential Rel-18 UE indicates the coverage of the channel is worse than that of the bottleneck channel of the reference NR UE.\nAs can be seen from the representative values in Table 8.2.1-2 and Table 8.2.1-3, for Urban scenario at 2.6 GHz with DL PSD of 33 dBm/MHz and maximum 11-PRB UE bandwidth:\n-\tWithout 3-dB UE antenna efficiency loss: the representative values of the coverage margins for the potential Rel-18 UE with 11-PRB BW for all channels are positive.\n-\tWith 3-dB UE antenna efficiency loss: the representative values of the coverage margins for the potential Rel-18 UE with 11-PRB BW for all channels are positive except for PDCCH CSS with AL2 and certain configuration of SIB1. The coverage of PDCCH CSS with AL2 has worse coverage by less than 1 dB than the bottleneck channel of the reference NR UE. A similar observation applies to SIB1. It should be noted that the reception schemes for SIB1 coverage simulations have different assumptions among sourcing companies. For example, some punctured the bits transmitted outside the potential Rel-18 UE's bandwidth while some performed soft combining the bits transmitted outside the potential Rel-18 UE's bandwidth by RF retuning at UE side.\nAs can be seen from the representative values in Table 8.2.1-2 and Table 8.2.1-3, PUSCH for the potential Rel-18 UE with maximum 11-PRB bandwidth, with or without 3dB UE antenna efficiency loss, has better coverage than the bottleneck channel of the reference NR UE and hence coverage recovery is not needed for PUSCH. This is because the cell-edge target data rates are scaled by a factor of 0.25 for the potential Rel-18 UE compared to the reference Rel-17 RedCap UE.\nTable 8.2.1-2 (part 1): In Urban scenario at 2.6GHz with DL 33dBm/MHz PSD, coverage margins for the potential Rel-18 UE with maximum 11-PRB bandwidth compared to the bottleneck channel for the reference NR UE in Table 8.2.1-1 when no UE antenna efficiency loss is assumed for the potential Rel-18 UE.\n\nTable 8.2.1-2 (part 2): In Urban scenario at 2.6GHz with DL 33dBm/MHz PSD, coverage margins for the potential Rel-18 UE with maximum 11-PRB bandwidth compared to the bottleneck channel for the reference NR UE in Table 8.2.1-1 when no UE antenna efficiency loss is assumed for the potential Rel-18 UE.\n\nTable 8.2.1-3 (part 1): In Urban scenario at 2.6GHz with DL 33dBm/MHz PSD, coverage margins for the potential Rel-18 UE with maximum 11-PRB bandwidth compared to the bottleneck channel for the reference NR UE in Table 8.2.1-1 when 3dB UE antenna efficiency loss is assumed for the potential Rel-18 UE.\n\nTable 8.2.1-3 (part 2): In Urban scenario at 2.6GHz with DL 33dBm/MHz PSD, coverage margins for the potential Rel-18 UE with maximum 11-PRB bandwidth compared to the bottleneck channel for the reference NR UE in Table 8.2.1-1 when 3dB UE antenna efficiency loss is assumed for the potential Rel-18 UE.\n\nFor the potential Rel-18 UE with maximum 12-PRB bandwidth, the coverage margins relative to the bottleneck channel of the reference NR UE are summarized in Table 8.2.1-4 (part 1 and part 2) and Table 8.2.1-5 (part 1 and part 2). In Table 8.2.1-4, no UE antenna efficiency loss is assumed for the potential Rel-18 UE with maximum 12-PRB bandwidth. In Table 8.2.1-5, the 3dB UE antenna efficiency loss is assumed in both DL and UL for the potential Rel-18 UE with maximum 12-PRB bandwidth.

Some companies evaluated soft combining of same portion of PBCH within 11 PRBs without performing RF retuning. Some companies evaluated soft combining of different portions of PBCH by performing RF retuning. Some companies performed RF retuning for receiving different portions of PBCH for each decoding trial but without soft combining.\nThe following are observed on PBCH coverage impact from the representative values in the last row of Table 8.2.1-6:\n-\tCompared to Rel-15 NR UE with soft/selective combining, the PBCH performance degradation of the potential Rel-18 UE by soft/selective combining without RF retuning is 11.87 dB.\n-\tCompared to Rel-15 NR UE with soft/selective combining, the PBCH performance degradation of the potential Rel-18 UE with soft/selective combining and RF retuning is 9.3 dB.\n-\tCompared to Rel-17 RedCap UE with soft/selective combining, the PBCH performance degradation of the potential Rel-18 UE with soft/selective combining without RF retuning is 5.05dB.\n-\tCompared to Rel-17 RedCap UE with soft/selective combining, the PBCH performance degradation of the potential Rel-18 UE with soft/selective combining and RF retuning is 2.51dB.\n\nTable 8.2.1-6: In Urban scenario at 2.6GHz with a target BLER of 1% for PBCH, coverage differences between a potential Rel-18 UE with maximum 11-PRB UE BW and the reference NR UE and between the potential Rel-18 UE and the Rel-17 RedCap UE\n\nIn Urban scenario at 2.6GHz with maximum 11-PRB UE bandwidth for the potential Rel-18 UE, for evaluation of broadcast channels PDCCH CSS and SIB1 coverage impact particularly from the coexistence perspective, the comparison between the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference NR UE in addition to the comparison between the potential Rel-18 UE and the Rel-17 RedCap UE by sourcing companies are summarized in Table 8.2.1-7. It is noted that the target BLER of PDCCH CSS is 1% and the target BLER of SIB1 is 10% in the evaluation. In addition, one-shot decoding is assumed for both PDCCH CSS and SIB1 in all cases in Table 8.2.1-7.\nFor the comparison of PDCCH CSS and SIB1 coverage differences between the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference Rel-17 RedCap UE, the configurations and evaluations assumptions are listed in the following.\n-\tThe potential Rel-18 UE is configured with PDCCH CSS with AL16 and CORESET of 48 PRBs and 2 OFDM symbols.\n-\tThe reference Rel-17 RedCap UE for comparison is configured with PDCCH CSS with AL16 and CORESET of 48 PRBs and 2 OFDM symbols.\n-\tThe potential Rel-18 UE is scheduled with SIB1 larger than 5MHz.\n-\tThe reference Rel-17 RedCap UE for comparison is scheduled with SIB1 larger than 5MHz.\n-\tFor both cases, the exact PRB numbers and MCS values are reported by sourcing companies in [7].\n-\tThe potential Rel-18 UE is scheduled with SIB1 within 5MHz.\n-\tThe reference Rel-17 RedCap UE for comparison is scheduled with SIB1 larger than 5MHz.\n-\tFor both cases, the exact PRB numbers and MCS values are reported by sourcing companies in [7].\n-\tIt is noted this pair of comparison can provide the following two aspects:\n-\tThe SIB1 coverage difference between the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference Rel-17 RedCap if a dedicated SIB1 within 5MHz is transmitted for the potential Rel-18 UE.\n-\tThe SIB1 coverage loss for the reference Rel-17 RedCap UE if a universal SIB1 that is confined within 5MHz to accommodate the maximum bandwidth of the potential Rel-18 UE is transmitted for both the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference Rel-17 RedCap UE.\nFor all the cases listed above, one-shot decoding without any soft combining was assumed for this evaluation to represent the coverage differences between the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference Rel-15 NR UE and between the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference Rel-17 RedCap UE before applying any coverage enhancement schemes.\nThe representative values in the last row of Table 8.2.1-7 are derived by taking the mean value (in dB domain) from all the companies results after excluding the highest and the lowest values.\nIn Urban scenario at 2.6GHz with maximum 11-PRB UE bandwidth for the potential Rel-18 UE, from the representative values in the last row of Table 8.2.1-7, the following observations can be made:\n-\tObservation 1: for PDCCH CSS with AL16 and 48PRB and 2 symbols, performance degradation of the potential Rel-18 UE is 15.26 dB and 8.91 dB compared with Rel-15 NR UE and Rel-17 RedCap UE, respectively.\n-\tObservation 2: for SIB1 greater than 5MHz, performance degradation of the potential Rel-18 UE is 17.50 dB and 11.24 dB compared with Rel-15 NR UE and Rel-17 RedCap UE, respectively.\n\nTable 8.2.1-7: In Urban scenario at 2.6GHz with 30kHz SCS, the comparisons of PDCCH CSS and SIB1 coverage differences between the potential Rel-18 UE and reference Rel-15 NR UE as well as those between the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference Rel-17 RedCap UE where one-shot decoding is assumed for all cases and maximum UE bandwidth of 11 PRBs is assumed for the potential Rel-18 UE.

This is because the cell-edge target data rates are scaled by a factor of 0.25 for the potential Rel-18 RedCap UE compared to the reference Rel-17 RedCap UE.\n\nTable 8.2.2-2 (part 1): In Rural scenario at 0.7GHz, coverage margins for the potential Rel-18 UE with maximum 11-PRB bandwidth compared to the bottleneck channel for the reference NR UE in Table 8.2.2-1 when no UE antenna efficiency loss is assumed for the potential Rel-18 UE.\n\nTable 8.2.2-2 (part 2): In Rural scenario at 0.7GHz, coverage margins for the potential Rel-18 UE with maximum 11-PRB bandwidth compared to the bottleneck channel for the reference NR UE in Table 8.2.2-1 when no UE antenna efficiency loss is assumed for the potential Rel-18 UE.\n\nTable 8.2.2-3 (part 1): In Rural scenario at 0.7GHz, coverage margins for the potential Rel-18 UE with maximum 11-PRB bandwidth compared to the bottleneck channel for the reference NR UE in Table 8.2.2-1 when 3dB UE antenna efficiency loss is assumed for the potential Rel-18 UE.\n\nTable 8.2.2-3 (part 2): In Rural scenario at 0.7GHz, coverage margins for the potential Rel-18 UE with maximum 11-PRB bandwidth compared to the bottleneck channel for the reference NR UE in Table 8.2.2-1 when 3dB UE antenna efficiency loss is assumed for the potential Rel-18 UE.\n\nIn Rural scenario at 0.7GHz with maximum 25-PRB UE bandwidth for the potential Rel-18 UE, for evaluation of PDCCH CSS/SIB1 coverage impact particularly from the coexistence perspective, the comparison between the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference NR UE in addition to the comparison between the potential Rel-18 UE and the Rel-17 RedCap UE by sourcing companies are summarized in Table 8.2.2-6. It is noted that the target BLER of PDCCH CSS is 1% and the target BLER of SIB1 is 10% in the evaluation. In addition, one-shot decoding is assumed for both PDCCH CSS and SIB1 in all cases in Table 8.2.2-6.\nFor the comparison of PDCCH CSS/SIB1 coverage differences between the potential Rel-18 UE with maximum 25-PRB UE bandwidth and the reference Rel-15 NR UE, the configurations and evaluation assumptions are listed as in the following.\n-\tThe potential Rel-18 UE is configured with PDCCH CSS with AL16 and CORESET of 48 PRBs and 2 OFDM symbols.\n-\tThe reference Rel-15 NR UE for comparison is configured with PDCCH CSS with AL16 and CORESET of 48 PRBs and 2 OFDM symbols.\n-\tThe potential Rel-18 UE is scheduled with SIB1 larger than 5MHz.\n-\tThe reference Rel-15 NR UE for comparison is scheduled with SIB1 larger than 5MHz.\n-\tThe exact PRB numbers and MCS values are reported by sourcing companies in [7].\nFor the comparison of PDCCH CSS/SIB1 coverage differences between the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference Rel-17 RedCap UE, the configurations and evaluations assumptions are listed in the following.\n-\tThe potential Rel-18 UE is configured with PDCCH CSS with AL16 and CORESET of 48 PRBs and 2 OFDM symbols.\n-\tThe reference Rel-17 RedCap UE for comparison is configured with PDCCH CSS with AL16 and CORESET of 48 PRBs and 2 OFDM symbols.\n-\tThe potential Rel-18 UE is configured with PDCCH CSS with AL8 and CORESET of 24 PRBs and 3 OFDM symbols.\n-\tThe reference Rel-17 RedCap UE for comparison is configured with PDCCH CSS with AL16 and CORESET of 48 PRBs and 2 OFDM symbols.\n-\tIt is noted this pair of comparison can provide the following two aspects:\n-\tThe PDCCH CSS coverage difference between the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference Rel-17 RedCap if a dedicated PDCCH CSS that is confined within 5MHz is transmitted for the potential Rel-18 UE.\n-\tThe PDCCH CSS coverage loss for the reference Rel-17 RedCap UE if a universal PDCCH CSS that is confined within 5MHz to accommodate the maximum bandwidth of the potential Rel-18 UE is transmitted for both the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference Rel-17 RedCap UE.\n-\tThe potential Rel-18 UE is scheduled with SIB1 larger than 5MHz.\n-\tThe reference Rel-17 RedCap UE for comparison is scheduled with SIB1 larger than 5MHz.\n-\tFor both cases, the exact PRB numbers and MCS values are reported by sourcing companies in [7].\n-\tThe potential Rel-18 UE is scheduled with SIB1 within 5MHz.\n-\tThe reference Rel-17 RedCap UE for comparison is scheduled with SIB1 larger than 5MHz.\n-\tFor both cases, the exact PRB numbers and MCS values are reported by sourcing companies in [7].\n-\tIt is noted this pair of comparison can provide the following two aspects:\n-\tThe SIB1 coverage difference between the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference Rel-17 RedCap if a dedicated SIB1 within 5MHz is transmitted for the potential Rel-18 UE.\n-\tThe SIB1 coverage loss for the reference Rel-17 RedCap UE if a universal SIB1 that is confined within 5MHz to accommodate the maximum bandwidth of the potential Rel-18 UE is transmitted for both the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference Rel-17 RedCap UE.\nFor all the cases listed above, one-shot decoding without any soft combining was assumed for this evaluation to represent the coverage differences between the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference Rel-15 NR UE and between the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference Rel-17 RedCap UE before applying any coverage enhancement schemes.\nThe representative values in the last row of Table 8.2.2-6 are derived by taking the mean value (in dB domain) from all the companies results after excluding the highest and the lowest values. In Rural scenario at 0.7GHz with maximum 25-PRB UE bandwidth for the potential Rel-18 UE, from the representative values in the last row of Table 8.2.2-6, the following observations can be made:\n-\tObservation 1: for PDCCH CSS with AL16 and 48PRB and 2 symbols, performance degradation of the potential Rel-18 UE is 7.30 dB and 3.53 dB compared with Rel-15 NR UE and Rel-17 RedCap UE, respectively.\n-\tObservation 2: for SIB1 greater than 5MHz, performance degradation of the potential Rel-18 UE is 7.57 dB and 3.93 dB compared with Rel-15 NR UE and Rel-17 RedCap UE, respectively.\n\nTable 8.2.2-6: In Rural scenario at 0.7GHz with 15kHz SCS, the comparisons of PDCCH CSS and SIB1 coverage differences between the potential Rel-18 UE and reference Rel-15 NR UE as well as those between the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference Rel-17 RedCap UE where one-shot decoding is assumed for all cases and maximum UE bandwidth of 25 PRBs is assumed for the potential Rel-18 UE.

A negative representative value for a channel of the potential Rel-18 UE indicates the coverage of the channel is worse than that of the bottleneck channel of the reference NR UE.\nAs can be seen from the representative values in Table 8.2.3-2 and Table 8.2.2-3, for Urban scenario at 4 GHz with DL PSD of 33 dBm/MHz and maximum 11-PRB UE bandwidth:\n-\tWithout 3-dB UE antenna efficiency loss: the representative values of the coverage margins for the potential Rel-18 UE with 11-PRB BW for all channels are positive.\n-\tWith 3-dB UE antenna efficiency loss: the representative values of the coverage margins for the potential Rel-18 UE with 11-PRB BW for all channels are positive.

                            "text_content": "In the coverage evaluation in Clause 8.2.1 through Clause 8.2.3, we have assumed the potential Rel-18 is a UE with maximum bandwidth reduced to 5MHz in both RF and BB, i.e., the BW1 complexity reduction option described in Clause 7.2, and have studied the corresponding coverage impact in different deployment scenarios.\nWhen comparing to the bottleneck channels of the reference NR UE, the evaluation results on coverage margins in clauses 8.2.1 through 8.2.3 can be summarized as follows for the potential Rel-18 UE with BW1 complexity reduction option.\n-\tFor Urban scenario at 2.6 GHz with 11-PRB UE BW and DL PSD of 33 dBm/MHz:\n-\tWithout 3dB antenna efficiency loss: all channels have positive coverage margins\n-\tWith 3dB antenna efficiency loss: all channels have positive coverage margins except for PDCCH CSS with AL2 and SIB1. Both are slightly worse than the bottleneck channel of the reference NR UE by less than 1dB.\n-\tFor Urban scenario at 2.6 GHz with 12-PRB UE BW and DL PSD of 33 dBm/MHz:\n-\tAll channels have positive coverage margins with or without 3dB antenna efficiency loss.\n-\tFor Rural scenario at 0.7 GHz:\n-\tWithout 3dB antenna efficiency loss: all channels have positive coverage margins\n-\tWith 3dB antenna efficiency loss: all channels have positive coverage margins except for Msg3 which is worse than the bottleneck channel by less than 0.1dB.\n-\tFor Urban scenario at 4 GHz with 11-PRB UE BW and DL PSD of 33 dBm/MHz\n-\tWithout 3dB UE antenna efficiency loss: all channels have positive coverage margins.\n-\tWith 3dB UE antenna efficiency loss: all channels have positive coverage margins. It is noted that PDCCH CSS with AL2, SIB1 and PUSCH have slightly better coverage by less than 2dB than the bottleneck channel of the reference NR UE.\n-\tIt is noted that results of individual sourcing companies show that Urban scenario at 4 GHz with 33 dBm/MHz DL PSD follows similar trends as the Urban scenario at 2.6 GHz with 33 dBm/MHz DL PSD.\n-\tFor Urban scenario at 4 GHz with 11-PRB UE BW and DL PSD of 24 dBm/MHz:\n-\tWithout 3dB antenna efficiency loss: PDCCH CSS, SIB1, Msg4, and PDCCH USS with AL2 have worse coverage than the bottleneck channel of the reference NR UE.\n-\tWith 3dB UE antenna efficiency loss: PBCH, PDCCH CSS, SIB1, Msg2, Msg4, and PDCCH USS all show worse coverage than the bottleneck channel of the reference NR UE.\nBased on the above summary on coverage margins for complexity reduction option BW1, we know that the determination of which channels have worse coverage than the bottleneck channel of reference NR UE, and the amount of coverage margins, would depend on the deployment scenario, on whether the 3dB UE antenna efficiency loss is assumed for the potential Rel-18 UE, and the value of DL PSD. It is also noted that PUSCH for the potential Rel-18 UE, with or without 3dB UE antenna efficiency loss, has better coverage than the bottleneck channel of the reference NR UE. This is because the cell-edge target data rates are scaled by a factor of 0.25 for the potential Rel-18 UE compared to the reference Rel-17 RedCap UE.\nThe coverage evaluation results based on complexity reduction option BW1 are further extended to other complexity reduction options introduced in Clause 7. It is noted in Clause 7.3.3 that PR1 and PR2 are not expected to have coverage impact. It is also noted in Clause 7.4.3 that PT1 and PT2 are not expected to impact coverage. Therefore, in the rest of this clause, the potential coverage impact in terms of coverage margins and broadcast channel coverage differences are summarized for complexity reduction options BW1, BW2, BW3 and PR3. It is noted that BW3 and PR3 are not expected to have coverage impact on PDCCH and PBCH since the bandwidth of channels other than PDSCH/PUSCH can be up to 20MHz with BW3 and PR3. It should be also noted that in the following comparison results, contiguous resource allocation has been assumed for PR3 which hence has same coverage impact results as BW3. Finally, no frequency hopping has been assumed for BW2 in the following evaluation results.\nFor complexity reduction options, BW1, BW2, BW3 and PR3, channels with negative representative coverage margins are summarized in Table 8.2.4-1. It is noted that results of individual sourcing companies show that Urban scenario at 4 GHz with 33 dBm/MHz DL PSD and maximum 11-PRB UE BW follows a similar trend as the Urban scenario at 2.6 GHz with 33 dBm/MHz DL PSD and maximum 11-PRB UE BW. However, Table 8.2.4-1 does not present the same results for these two scenarios. This is because Table 8.2.4-1 is summarized based on representative values which are determined by inputs of sourcing companies. And the number of sourcing companies for these two scenarios is different.\nTable 8.2.4-1: Channels with negative representative coverage margins for different complexity reductions options and different deployment scenarios\n\nBased on the evaluation results on coverage difference in Clause 8.2.1 and 8.2.2 based on the complexity reduction option BW1 and the description of the complexity reduction options in Clause 7, the following tables show the coverage differences with respective to the reference NR UE and the Rel-17 RedCap UEs for the complexity reduction options, BW1, BW2, BW3, and PR3, over the considered scenarios.\nIf not otherwise notified, 2.6GHz is assumed for Urban scenario since Urban scenario at 4GHz with DL PSD of 33dBm/MHz shares a similar trend with 2.6 GHz with 33dBm/MHz regarding broadcast channel coverage difference comparison between the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference NR UE/the Rel-17 RedCap UE. For Rural scenario, the coverage difference for PBCH is not available in the captured tables since bandwidth of PBCH is confined with the potential Rel-18 UE's maximum BW for all complexity reduction options evaluated.\nFor a potential Rel-18 UE with BW3 or PR3, it should be noted no PBCH and PDCCH CSS coverage differences are observed compared to the reference Rel-17 RedCap UE. When compared to the reference Rel-15 NR UE, PDCCH CSS coverage differences of -5.18 dB and -3.04 dB are observed for Urban at 2.6 GHz and Rural scenario at 0.7 GHz, respectively. PBCH coverage difference of 6.8 dB is observed for Urban scenario at 2.6GHz. The observed differences also represent for the differences between the reference Rel-17 RedCap UE and the reference Rel-15 NR UE. Furthermore, the observed differences are mainly resulted in the different numbers of receive antennas.\nTable 8.2.4-2: In Urban scenario at 2.6GHz with 30kHz SCS, coverage differences of broadcast channels including PBCH, PDCCH CSS, and SIB1 between the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference Rel-15 NR/Rel-17 RedCap UEs with complexity reduction options BW1, BW2, BW3 and PR3.\n\nTable 8.2.4-3: In Rural scenario at 0.7 GHz with 15kHz SCS, coverage differences of broadcast channels including PDCCH CSS and SIB1 between the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference Rel-15 NR/Rel-17 RedCap UEs with complexity reduction options BW1, BW2, BW3 and PR3\n\nFrom the above comparison on broadcast channel coverage differences between the potential Rel-18 UE and the reference Rel-15 NR/Rel-17 RedCap UEs, the following observations can be made for complexity reduction options BW1, BW2, BW3, and PR3:\n-\tCoverage difference is larger in Urban scenario (30 kHz SCS) than in Rural scenario (15 kHz SCS) due to a smaller RB number with 30 kHz SCS within 5MHz bandwidth.\n-\tIn Urban scenario (30 kHz SCS), the coverage difference is the largest for SIB1 and the smallest for PBCH, with PDCCH CSS (48 RBs) in the middle.\n-\tFor SIB1 (>5MHz), coverage degradation of 11.24 dB is observed with BW1, BW2, BW3 and PR3 options compared to Rel-17 RedCap UE.\n-\tFor PDCCH (AL16 and 48 RBs), coverage degradation of 8.91 dB is observed with BW1 and BW2 options compared to Rel-17 RedCap UE\n-\tFor PBCH (20 RBs), coverage degradation of 5.05 dB (2.51 dB) is observed with BW1 and BW2 options without RF retuning (with RF retuning) compared to Rel-17 RedCap UE.\n-\tIt is noted that BW3 and PR3 do not cause coverage degradation to PBCH and PDCCH compared to Rel-17 RedCap UE.\nFor broadcast channels with large coverage differences such as SIB1, the potential Rel-18 UE may utilize additional processing/combining to compensate the coverage difference when considering coexistence and minimizing impact on legacy UEs.\n",

            "description": "Further NR RedCap UE complexity reduction techniques have been analyzed individually in clauses 7.2 through 7.4 as well as in different combinations in clause 7.5. The coverage impacts of the complexity reduction techniques have been analyzed in clause 8. The main observations from the coverage impact evaluations are summarized in clause 8.2.4.\nBased on the analysis of the studied UE complexity reduction options, most companies in RAN1 recommend that a single option is down-selected from a list of options as the main Rel-18 RedCap UE complexity reduction option at RAN plenary. The list includes the following options.\n-\tOption BW3:\n-\t5 MHz BB bandwidth only for PDSCH (for both unicast and broadcast) and PUSCH with 20 MHz RF bandwidth for UL and DL.\n-\tThe other physical channels and signals are still allowed to use a BWP up to the 20 MHz maximum UE RF+BB bandwidth.\n-\tOption PR3:\n-\tRestriction of maximum number of PRBs for PDSCH and PUSCH.\n-\tFor 15 kHz SCS, the maximum number of RBs is 25.\n-\tFor 30 kHz SCS, the maximum number of RBs is 11 or 12.\n-\tThe restricted number of PRBs in Option PR3 is a hardcoded limit.\nSome of the companies who participated in the study also wanted to include one or both of the following options in the above list, for RAN plenary to assess the trade-off between degree of complexity reduction and specification impact.\n-\tOption PR1:\n-\tRelaxation of the constraint  for peak data rate reduction.\n-\tThe relaxed constraint is, e.g., 1 (instead of 4).\n-\tThe parameters (, , ) can be as in Rel-17 RedCap [4].\n-\tOption BW1:\n-\tBoth RF and BB bandwidths are 5 MHz for UL and DL.\nFurthermore, RAN1 recommends that Option PR1 is considered as a potential add-on. Whether to adopt this potential add-on can be decided during WI phase.\nWhether or not to also introduce support for option PT1 and/or PT2 for a Rel-18 RedCap UE can be decided at RAN plenary.\n-\tOption PT1:\n-\tRelaxation of UE processing time for PDSCH/PUSCH in terms of N1 and N2 (as defined in TS 38.214) compared to those of UE processing time capability 1\n-\tThe relaxation factor for N1 and N2 is assumed to be 2 in the study.\n-\tOption PT2:\n-\tRelaxation of UE processing time for CSI in terms of Z and Z' compared to the values defined in TS 38.214 clause 5.4\n-\tThe relaxation factor for Z and Z' is assumed to be 2 in the study.\n\n\n\n",
