            "description": "Demand for improved 5G cellular coverage and connectivity continues to increase, which may be challenging in many outdoor and mobility scenarios. In some outdoor environments, the availability of vehicles equipped with mobile base station relays, either following a certain known/predictable itinerary (e.g. buses, trams, etc), or situated in convenient locations (e.g. outside stadiums, hot-spot areas, or emergency sites), could provide very opportunistic boost to cellular coverage and capacity when/where needed. Those relays, using 5G wireless backhaul toward the macro network, could indeed offer better 5G coverage and connectivity to neighbouring UEs. Vehicle relays are obviously very suitable also for improving connectivity for users or devices inside the vehicle itself, in different environments, e.g. for passengers in buses, car/taxi, or trains, ad-hoc/professional personnel or equipment. Yet other target scenarios are where vehicle relays can be used for reaching users or devices that would otherwise have no or very poor macro coverage, e.g. in case of first responders dislocated in indoor buildings/areas, using 5G relays placed on their nearby/outside vehicles to get required 5G coverage and connectivity.\nThe technical benefits of using vehicle relays include, among others, the ability of the BS relay to get better macro coverage than a nearby UE, e.g exploiting better RF/antenna and power capabilities. Besides the value for network operators and end users, worthy incentives could be found for other parties as well, e.g. for vehicles manufacturers, vehicle/fleet owners or providers, to install and operate relays in their vehicles.\nIn the context of this TR, from a high-level 5G system point of view, the target scenarios include moving vehicles equipped with small on board base station (BS) relays providing 5G coverage and communication to UEs (inside the vehicle and/or in its vicinity), and connected wirelessly to the 5G network via RAN (donor) nodes.\nFigure 4-1 illustrates the high-level concept of a mobile base station relay, showcasing the various components involved in its operation. The figure depicts the base station relay (BSR) as the central hub, connected to multiple antennas and radio frequency (RF) chains. These RF chains are responsible for transmitting and receiving signals, while the antennas facilitate directional communication. The BSR is also linked to a power supply unit (PSU) for energy management and a cooling system to maintain optimal operating temperatures. Additionally, the figure includes a graphical representation of signal strength, indicating the distribution of coverage across the relay's operational area. This visual aids in understanding the relay's role in extending network coverage and improving connectivity in remote or challenging environments.\nFigure 4-1. Mobile base station relay - High level concept\nAs shown in the figure above, the main connectivity assumptions are:\n5G NR is used for the radio link between mobile BS relay and donor RAN node, as well as the radio link between BS relay and UE.\nThe mobile BS relay connects, via donor RAN node, to the 5G Core network (5GC).\nSingle-hop relay is the main/baseline scenario (multi-hop can be a possible option)\nThe study intends to cover use cases of BS relays mounted on ground/land type of mobile vehicles; nevertheless, some potential requirements may be general (for a “mobile base station relay”), i.e. could apply to BS relays mounted on different types of moving vehicles or devices.\nNOTE 1: the above (logical) diagram and assumptions do not intend to limit nor preclude specific RAN and relay architecture, or topology options.\nNOTE 2: While the identified new service requirements target potential 5G system (UE and/or NW) enhancements, this should not prevent support (also) for legacy UEs.\nIn the paragraphs that follow, next section (sec. 5) captures several identified use cases and new potential requirements, covering (among others): basic operation of vehicle relays, relay configuration, UE access control, optimized connectivity and mobility, load balancing, support of location services, QoS and charging, service continuity during mobility (between relay and macro, or among relays or when macro node changes), multi-connectivity, ad-hoc coverage and topologies (e.g. for public safety), RAN/relay sharing, satellite backhauling.\nIn addition to those, section 6 covers further aspects and requirements, e.g. about support of roaming, regulatory requirements, emergency services, security, priority services.\nThe two concluding sections (sec. 7 and 8) contain the list of consolidated new potential requirements, from all use cases, and the final TR recommendations.\n",

The figure shows the base station mounted on a vehicle, with various antennas and communication equipment. The vehicle is equipped with a power supply and computing resources to support the base station's operations. This type of base station is particularly useful for emergency situations, disaster recovery, or temporary deployments in regions where traditional infrastructure is not available or is damaged. The vehicle-mounted base station can provide connectivity to mobile devices in the vicinity, enabling communication even in remote or challenging environments.\nFigure 5.3-1: Vehicle mounted base station\n\n",

The food there is very good, plus the restaurant is conveniently located across from the downtown bus transit hub/station, which enables Tom to reach the restaurant easily by public transportation. All buses in Tom’s city are equipped with mobile base station relays.\nTom arrives early at the restaurant and sits down at a table. His phone registers with the mobile base station relay mounted on a bus across the street awaiting departure. Tom starts streaming his favorite TV show on his phone while waiting for his friends.\nFigure 5.11.3-3 illustrates a wireless communication system, showcasing the various components involved in the transmission and reception of signals. The figure depicts a base station, or gNB, which serves as the central hub for signal transmission and reception. From the gNB, signals are transmitted to multiple user equipment (UEs), which are distributed across the coverage area. The figure also includes a representation of the environment, with buildings and other obstacles that can affect signal propagation. The presence of these obstacles highlights the importance of efficient signal routing and beamforming techniques to ensure reliable communication. Additionally, the figure shows the use of multiple antennas at the gNB and UEs, which are essential for achieving high data rates and improving overall system performance.\nFigure 5.11.3-3\nThe driver of the bus equipped with the mobile base station relay serving Tom’s phone gets in the bus and prepare to depart. The driver turns on the engine, closes the doors, and starts driving the bus toward the exit of the bus transit hub, then makes a left into the avenue.\nThe network determines that the serving relay is moving away from Tom’s phone and hands over Tom’s phone to a relay located in another bus awaiting departure at the bus transit hub. All ongoing services in the phone, including the streaming of the TV show, are transferred without service interruption.\nTom’s friends arrive at the restaurant, and they order lunch.\nTom’s streaming video was transferred seamlessly from the mobile base station relay mounted on the first bus, to a mobile base station relay mounted the second bus. Tom is very pleased that he was able to watch his TV show without interruption while he was waiting for his friends.\nFigure 5.11.3-4 presents a detailed network topology diagram, illustrating the interconnected nodes and pathways of a complex communication network. The figure showcases multiple layers of routers, switches, and other network devices, each represented by distinct shapes and colors. The arrangement of these components suggests a high level of organization and efficiency, with each device strategically placed to optimize data flow and minimize latency. The use of multiple pathways and redundant connections indicates a robust design capable of handling high volumes of traffic and providing reliable service. The figure serves as a valuable tool for network administrators and engineers to visualize and understand the structure and performance of their network infrastructure.\nFigure 5.11.3-4\nCurrent requirements (e.g. related to wireless self-backhaul, see 22.261, sec 6.12) or existing functionalities (e.g. IAB), cover scenarios of autonomous configuration/adaptation of network topologies, but do not assume or fully address physical relay mobility.\n[PR 5.11.3-2] The 5G system shall be able to support efficient handover when a UE active communication changes between mobile base stations relays (e.g. mounted on a vehicle), ensuring end-to-end service continuity during mobility of the UE (e.g. moving outside the vehicle) and/or the relays.\n",

In remote areas, satellite access or self-backhaul provide a clear solution for extending the range of / complementing a mobile network.\nFor indoor scenarios, beyond the point where outdoor access penetrates, currently 3GPP offers two possibilities.\nOne is for the indoor premises to deploy non-3GPP access. Through this, a terminal can access a mobile network to get telecommunication services (or access Internet services directly.) This possibility is enabled since Release 7 (IWLAN interworking) by this and later 3GPP standards.\nA second possibility is to offer coverage extension, indoors – either through wireless repeaters or a fixed infrastructure in the indoors premises. This is discussed in TR 22.867, Annex A.\nA new possibility is presented in this use case – to make use of a number of vehicles to create a transient wireless topology of multiple vehicular relays capable of supporting indoor coverage where it would otherwise not be feasible.\nA similar scenario was considered in FS_REFEC (TR 22.866, clause 6.7) as a Traffic Scenario for Public Safety. A number of firefighters penetrate a building without indoor macro cellular coverage and deploy a set of portable (UE) relays in strategic places, e.g. the top and bottom of stairwells, as they access portions of the build with poor or no coverage otherwise.\nIn this use case, there is a large underground parking structure with no coverage nor is there an incentive or possibility (e.g. due to safety issues) to create fixed coverage extension. Other examples of this could be waste disposal sites, inactive mines, abandoned properties, search and rescue operations in challenging terrain in remote areas (e.g. caves), through underground intrastructure (e.g. sewers, water supply, transit tunnels) or building complexes where investment in coverage extension does not occur.\nFigure 5 illustrates the complex network infrastructure of an underground parking garage, showcasing a transient network extension. The figure depicts the various access points, routers, and switches that facilitate connectivity within the garage. It also highlights the wireless access points and fiber optic cables that extend the network beyond the physical boundaries of the garage. The layout emphasizes the strategic placement of network equipment to ensure seamless coverage and optimal performance for users within the parking facility.\nFigure 5.15.1-1: Underground Parking Garage with Transient Network Extension\nUnlike the case studied in REFEC, this scenario involves vehicular mobile relays providing 5G coverage extension from outdoor to indoor.\n5.15.2\tPre-conditions\nThe following are assumed to be available for this use case:\n- \t5G macro cellular coverage to the exterior of the facility into which transient coverage is required, e.g. to connect users, sensors or other IoT devices in the facility. In Figure 5.x.1-1, this is the vehicle parked across the entrance of the garage;\n- \ta set of vehicles equipped with relays, configured to work together to provide a network topology. These vehicles could proceed autonomously, controlled remotely or be driven by personnel. In Figure 5.x.1-1, these are the mobile vehicle relay nodes.\n- \ta topography consisting of regions that are accessible to vehicles, portions of which need coverage, even if temporarily or ad hoc coverage. In Figure 5.x.1-1, this is the concrete (and steel) underground parking complex shown only schematically.\n5.15.3\tService Flows\nThe mobile relays proceed into the vicinity of the facility that lacks coverage, in this case the garage. Where necessary, vehicles remain in positions that advance the coverage into the topology. Other vehicles continue, to bring coverage specifically to portions of the facility that need it. The mobile relays topology may change depending on dynamic coverage demand, e.g the vehicle relays can move or reconfigure to provide access to different areas or moving users, when and where indoor coverage is required.\n5.15.4\tPost-conditions\nSensors and other IoT devices in the facility (for example air quality meters in the parking garage), as well as users who need only periodic connectivity (e.g. to upload and download data opportunistically), will receive connectivity from the transient coverage extension. This will enable data collection from a range of otherwise isolated devices and other communication on a periodic basis, or as needed (e.g. during a disaster response).\nThe service that is provided to the end systems is 3GPP service (not ProSe UE to network.)\n5.15.5\tExisting features partly or fully covering the use case functionality\nNR Rel-16 introduces a relaying architecture enabling routing across a backhaul network of relay nodes which uses NR-Uu interface to interconet relay nodes, enabling data transfer from network access node to the end-user, and back: IAB. In Rel-17, IAB is currently being enhanced, although relay (IAB-node) mobility is not being taken into account.\n5.15.6\tPotential New Requirements needed to support the use case\n[PR.5.15.6-001] The 5G System shall be able to support dynamic deployment and configuration of one or more mobile base station relays (e.g. mounted on vehicles) for providing ad-hoc indoor coverage extension in specific locations.\n",

The satellite platform is also in motion (see the displacement during T1 to T2 – which is not drawn to scale.) Satellite access is available for both vehicles. Even as the satellite moves, the vehicles continue to be in coverage and serve their passengers with relayed coverage.\nFigure 5 illustrates the concept of vehicle relays supported by a non-stationary satellite platform, showcasing the communication process between vehicles and the satellite. The figure depicts the relay vehicle, which acts as a temporary communication hub, and the satellite that provides the necessary connectivity. The diagram highlights the role of the satellite in providing coverage to the relay vehicle, which in turn enables communication with other vehicles or ground stations. The figure emphasizes the importance of such relay systems in extending communication range and improving network reliability in areas with limited terrestrial infrastructure.\nFigure 5.16-1: Vehicle Relays supported by a non-stationary satellite platform\nAt T3, the black satellite will no longer be able to provide coverage to the vehicles. A separate satellite platform (shown in gray) that is part of the same satellite network follows. Even as the first platform cannot offer coverage, the second takes its place. There is thus continuity of service by means of a sequence of transitions to make use of different satellite platforms offering access to the vehicular mobile relays.\nThis use case does not differentiate (at the service level) between the situation where the satellites are transparent (in which case the donor RAN is terrestrial), or whether the satellite is regenerative (in which case the donor RAN is the satellite platform itself.)\n",

This use case addresses the needs of users who are not moving with the vehicle-mounted relay but that can benefit from its offered connectivity when users and vehicle-mounted relays are close.\nIn particular, this use case addresses the needs of those UEs that either have limited connectivity (e.g., when connected to a macro cell) or that have too demanding bandwidth needs.\nOur first use case is about a user, Tom, an emergency physician who just arrived at a car accident. Tom is attending several injured persons. Tom is having a call with other clinicians at a close-by hospital discussing the health state of the patients and to which hospital the patients should be transferred. Tom would also like to retrieve the Electronic Health Record (EHR) of the patients to do a better assessment. However, the network connectivity at his current location – the accident area -- is insufficient, in particular, to download some bulky files in the EHR of the patients. In this situation, it is beneficial if the 5G system can schedule the transfer of the EHR content requested by Tom so that the EHR is transferred by means of a relay mounted on one of the ambulances approaching the accident area. This example is shown in Figure x-1 where the ambulance is denoted AMR, i.e., Ambulance-Mounted Relay. In Figure x-1 Tom’s UE is denoted UE. At location L0 and time T0 the EHR data transfer is requested by the UE. The data is then transferred when the AMR is at location L2 since at this location the communication link between donor gNB and AMR and between AMR and UE offer the best end-to-end performance. The location is chosen by using, known or predicted, the AMR mobility pattern to optimize the network behaviour. In some cases, the AMR could receive the EHR data from the donor gNB at location L1 and time T1 and when the AMR is at location L3 at time T3, the AMR could rapidly deliver the requested EHR data to Tom’s UE. In this alternative approach, the locations L1 and L3 are chosen to optimize the individual link performance between donor gNB and AMR and between AMR and UE. The choice of these locations is also based on the known or predicted AMR mobility pattern.\nFigure 5.2 presents an example scenario in a telecommunication network, illustrating the interaction between various network elements. The figure showcases a network with multiple nodes, including a central node, edge nodes, and a cloud-based data center. The nodes are interconnected through a series of links, which are represented by lines of varying thicknesses to denote different types of connections, such as high-speed fiber-optic cables or wireless links. The figure also includes a graphical representation of data packets moving through the network, emphasizing the flow of information and the importance of efficient routing and processing. The layout of the network and the flow of data packets provide insights into the network's performance and capacity, highlighting the need for optimized resource allocation and management.\nFigure 5.21-1. Example scenario\nOther relevant and related use cases include:\nIoT devices requiring the delivery of a software update. Some IoT devices might lack a good connection but be able to retrieve the software update from a vehicle-mounted relay, when it is close by.\nUsers requiring access to bulky resources, e.g., a movie, but with insufficient connectivity at their current location. Users might retrieve the files from an approaching vehicle-mounted relay selected based on the mobility pattern of the VMR.\n",
