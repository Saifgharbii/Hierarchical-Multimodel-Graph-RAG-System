An intent driven system will be able to learn the behaviour of networks and services and allows a customer to provide the desired state, without detailed knowledge of how to get to the desired state. Thus, the intent driven management is introduced to reduce the complexity of management without getting into the intricate detail of the underlying network resources.\n",

The intent may provide information on particular objective and possibly some related details. Following are some general concepts for intent:\n-\tAn intent is typically understandable by humans, and also needs to be interpreted by the machine without any ambiguity.\n-\tAn intent focuses more on describing the \"What\" needs to be achieved but less on \"How\" that outcomes should be achieved, The intent expresses the metrics that need to be achieved and not how to achieve them. This not only relieves the burden of the consumer knowing implementation details but also leaves room to allow the producer to explore alternative options and find optimal solutions. Intent describes the properties that allows a satisfactory outcome.\n-\tThe expectations expressed by an intent is agnostic to the underlying system implementation, technology and infrastructure. Area can be used as managed object in the expectations expressed by an intent to achieve system implementation, technology and infrastructure agnostic.\nFigure 4.1.1-1 illustrates a telecommunication network, specifically focusing on the signal transmission and reception process. The figure showcases the various components involved, including the transmitter, which generates the signal, and the receiver, which decodes the signal. The signal is transmitted through a series of transmission lines, which are represented by the solid lines in the figure. These lines connect the transmitter and receiver, forming a path for the signal to travel.\n\nIn addition to the transmission lines, the figure also includes a series of repeaters, which are represented by the dashed lines. These repeaters are used to amplify the signal and extend its range, allowing it to reach further distances. The figure also shows the presence of noise, which is represented by the dotted lines. Noise can interfere with the signal and cause it to be distorted or lost.\n\nThe figure also includes a representation of the environment in which the signal is transmitted, including buildings and other obstacles. These obstacles can cause the signal to reflect off them and travel in different directions, which can affect the quality of the signal.\n\nOverall, Figure 4.1.1-1 provides a detailed overview of the telecommunication network, highlighting the various components involved in signal transmission and reception, as well\nFigure 4.1.1-1\n-\tAn intent needs to be quantifiable from network data so that the fulfilment result can be measured and evaluated.\nIntent can be categorized based on different user types or different management scenario types.\n",

The figure showcases the diverse objectives and actions taken by network operators, service providers, and end-users, highlighting the intricate dynamics of communication networks. The model emphasizes the importance of understanding and aligning these roles to ensure efficient and effective communication services.\nFigure 4.1.2-1: High-level model of different kind of intents expressed by different roles\n-\tIntent from Communication Service Customer (Intent-CSC): Intent from Communication Service Customer enables Communication Service Customer (CSC) to express which properties of a communication service the CSC may request from CSP without knowing how to do the detailed management for communication service. For example, Intent-CSC can be 'Enable a V2X communication service for a group of vehicles in certain time'.\n-\tIntent from Communication Service Provider (Intent-CSP): Intent from Communication Service Provider enables Communication Service Provider (CSP) to express an intent about what CSP would like to do for network without knowing how to do the detailed management for network. For example, Intent-CSP can be 'Provide a network service supporting V2X communications for highway-417 to support 500 vehicles simultaneously'.\n-\tIntent from Network Operator (Intent-NOP): Intent from Network Operator enables Network Operator (NOP) to provide what NOP would like to do for group of network elements (i.e. subnetwork) management and control without knowing how to do the detailed management for the network elements. For example, Intent-NOP can be 'Provide a radio network service to satisfy the specified coverage requirements and UE throughput requirement in certain area'.\n",

For example, for the purpose of requesting a radio network with a new coverage, one possible solution (non-intent driven approach) is to use the set of classic MnSs (e.g. provisioning MnS) to decommission a cell and instantiate the cell to a new Node B for the new coverage. The alternative solution (intent driven approach) is to use management service produced by the domain, which may be referred to as the Intent-driven MnS by stating the intent for the radio network for the new coverage, based on the intent, system can trigger actions (e.g. decommission a cell and instantiate the cell to a new Node B) to satisfy received intent. The Intent driven MnS could in principle deployed as a replacement of the deployed classic MnSs for the same network and service management purpose, where the consumer focuses on the 'what' and the producer is concerned about the 'how'.\nThe producer of an Intent-driven MnS shall allow the consumer to manage the service and / or network resources through the use of intents. The producer shall support the capabilities for intent fulfilment, which include the following:\n-\tThe consumer states the intent to be fulfilled (which can be implemented by createMOI operation on the Intent IOC) and the producer receives and acknowledges the receipt of the intent.\n-\tThe producer translates the intent to identify which actions are needed for intent fulfilment.\n-\tThe producer executes the required actions to fulfil the intent.\n-\tThe producer may report about the fulfilment result of the intent.\n",

New/simpler ways of managing are needed.\nActions of an intent driven MnS related to the fulfilment of intents may be categorized as intent deployment and intent assurance. Intent fulfilment refers to the steps taken to satisfy a newly received intent or an update to an existing intent. The goal of intent fulfilment is to bring the network or service's state to satisfy the new or updated intent. The fulfilment of some intents may end at the intent deployment, in these cases, the intent's goal only describes the availability or presence of a network or service. In other cases, the intent's goal describes additionally the assurance requirements for a network or service (e.g. quality of service, end user experience, SLS, etc.) in addition to the need of existence of a network or service. Those intents have their fulfilment tied to the operation of the referred network or service and may require frequent recurring actions to keep those assurance requirements achieved. This part of the intent fulfilment is referred to as intent assurance.\nAn Intent driven MnS allows its consumer to express intents for managing the network and services and obtain the feedback of intent evaluation result. The Intent-driven MnS producer have the following intent handling capabilities:\n-\tTranslate the received intent to executable actions as follows:\n-\tPerforming service or network management tasks.\n-\tIdentifying, formulating, and activating policies for service or network management.\n-\tEvaluate the result/information about the intent fulfilment, including intent deployment (e.g. the intent is initially satisfied or not) and intent assurance (e.g. the intent is continuously satisfied).\nFigure 4.2.2-1 shows the model of Intent-driven MnS.\nFigure 4.2.2 -1: Intent-driven MnS illustrates the process of intent-driven multi-access and service orchestration in a telecommunications network. The figure showcases the interaction between the network management system (NMS) and the network function virtualized (NFV) environment, highlighting the dynamic allocation of resources based on user intent. Key components include the service function chain (SFC), virtual network functions (VNFs), and policy control points. The figure emphasizes the efficiency and agility achieved through the integration of intent-based networking principles.\"\nFigure 4.2.2-1: Intent-driven MnS\nThe intents may be fulfilled by utilizing multiple mechanisms including among others: Rule-based mechanisms, closed loop mechanisms and AI/ML based mechanisms. These mechanisms can be combined in solutions of various complexity, ranging from a simple approach rule-based mechanisms, to more elaborate solutions combining AI/ML, closed loop automation to ensure the fulfilment of intents.\nWhen the intent is created by MnS producer based on MnS consumer’s request, the MnS producer may consume other management services (including non-intent driven MnS and intent driven MnS) to fulfil or satisfy the intent, e.g. creating new assurance closed control loop instance(s) or using assurance closed control loop instance (s) to satisfy the intent. The internal implementation of the intent fulfilment will however not be standardized.\nAn Intent driven MnS includes the following management capabilities to support intent lifecycle management:\n-\tCreate an intent, a MnS Consumer request MnS producer to create a new intent.\n-\tActivate an intent, MnS Consumer request MnS producer to activate an intent  when the intent is suspended.\n-\tDe-activate an intent, MnS consumer request MnS producer to de-activate an intent for a temporary suspension.\n-\tDelete an intent, MnS Consumer request MnS producer to remove an intent.\n-\tModify an intent, MnS Consumer request MnS producer to modify the content of the intent (e.g. expectation targets).\n-\tQuery an intent, MnS Consumer request MnS producer to return the content and state (e.g. active, inactive) of the intent.\n",

For certain scenarios, policies can be used in conjunction with intents to achieve the autonomous purposes. Figure 4.4-1 describes the relation between rule, policy and intent in the \"what-how\" view. As it now stands, the telecom systems are mainly focused on \"how\" and \"less what\". The current 5G networks brings more operational complexities, and the telecom system need to be able to adapt their operation to the business objectives of the operator as well as expectations of customer, which is driving customer to shift the focus from \"how\" to \"what\". The first step towards that shift, has been shift from \"Rule based management\" to \"Policy driven management\", with more focus on \"how\" and less on \"what\" covering domain specific issues/aspects (an example for policy is when the average throughput is lower than certain threshold, take specified actions). As technologies are evolving and the level of complexity exceeds, the need for an abstraction level description (i.e. Intent) becomes more apparent (an example for intent is the target average throughput for certain area should be assured). An intent driven system will be able to learn the behaviour of networks and services and allows a customer to provide the desired state, without detailed knowledge of how to get to the desired state.\nFigure 4.4-1 illustrates the intricate relationship between rules, policies, and intents within a telecommunication system. The figure showcases how these components interact to regulate network behavior, ensuring efficient and secure communication. The rule set serves as the foundation, defining the constraints and guidelines that the system must adhere to. Policies, derived from rules, outline the specific actions that the system should take in response to certain conditions. Finally, intents encapsulate the overall goals and objectives of the system, guiding the implementation of rules and policies to achieve desired outcomes. The figure emphasizes the importance of a well-structured and interconnected system, where each component plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and performance of the telecommunication network.\nFigure 4.4-1: Relation between rule, policy and intent\n",

The context describes a set of conditions to trigger corresponding management tasks to acheive the expectation targets. For example, the consumer may state that: \"ensure that handoverFailureRate < 2 % if Load > 80 %\", where the expectation target (HandoverFailureRate < 2 %) is to be achieved only in the context (Load > 80 %). In this example, the producer will perform handover tasks to achieve the expectation target \"HandoverFailureRate < 2 %\" when observe the context \"Load > 80 %\".\nSimilar to the target, the context is also a tuple of < attribute, condition, value range > but where the values having a different semantics.\nAlthough contexts and targets have the same structure, to distinguish between what needs to be achieved and the context which is only to be considered as required conditions, the context has to be explicitly stated separate from the target. For example, if the consumer wishes that the Radio Link Failure rate (RLF) is less than 2 % when the load is more than 50 %. If the context (i.e. load > 50 %) is not explicitly stated/modelled as context, the producer could interpret the request to mean (RLF < 2 % and load > 50 %).\nFor a given expectation, the specific list of expectation targets may be desired to be achieved for given combined contexts, i.e. besides the expectation targets, an expectation may state a list of contexts which apply to all expectation targets within the intent expectation. Similarly, there may be contexts that apply to all expectations within a given intent. Correspondingly, both Intent expectations and intents should be modelled to only contain the contexts that apply to all the contained sub elements.\nMultiple contexts may be stated on an intent, on an intentExpecation, on an expectationObject or on an expectationtarget. However, the MnS consumer expressing multiple overlapping contexts may not have interest in simulteneosly applying all the overlapping contexts but only in applying any one or more of the contexts. For example, the consumer may have requirements for any one of multiple physical locations at any given time. In such cases, the MnS consumer requires means to express the context to be selected among any one of these. Otherwise, the producer will either deliver for all contexts. Alternatively, the MnS consumer would only be able to express one context at time and wait e.g., for a feasibility check to fail to then resend the intent with revied context.\n4.5.5\tGeneral Requirements\nREQ-Intent_GEN-1 The intent driven MnS shall include a capability enabling MnS consumer to express intent containing one or more intent expectations, each expectation a list of desired outcomes on objects of the same type with optional contexts for the desired outcomes, expectations or the intent.\nREQ-Intent_ GEN-2 The intent driven MnS shall include a capability enabling MnS consumer to state the selection mechanism (including \"ALL_OF\", \"ONE_OF\", \"ANY_OF\") to be applied to the stated list of contexts.\n\n",

Energy saving is achieved by executing the energy saving actions with suitable parameter configurations, e.g. energy saving state switch, start time and end time, the energy saving thresholds. However, the various combinations of energy saving actions can lead to conflicts. For example, different energy saving actions may be contradictory, or the energy saving actions may conflict with other activities (e.g. network optimization actions). Moreover, it is not straightforward to evaluate the influence on service experience (e.g. UL/DL RAN UE throughput, latency) of energy saving actions beforehand, which makes it difficult to balance the energy saving effect and service experience, for example the energy saving actions may deteriorate the service experience. To avoid affecting the service experience, MnS consumer may express energy saving target with the maximum value of RAN energy consumption in intent expectation, and MnS producer is able to choose an optimal value of RAN energy consumption to save energy as much as possible in the context to satisfy the service experience.\nAs clause 4.1.1 described, an intent focuses more on describing the \"What\" needs to be achieved but less on \"How\" that outcomes should be achieved, which not only relieves the burden of the consumer knowing implementation details but also leaves room to allow the producer to explore alternative options and find optimal solutions. So, introducing the intent approach for energy saving, which can enable the 3GPP management system to analyse and select the optimal balance between the energy saving effect and service experience by utilizing some intelligence mechanisms. In intent driven approach, a MnS consumer expresses intent expectation for RAN energy saving in the specified area (e.g. geographical area) to a MnS producer, which may include the RAN energy saving target (e.g. the maximum value of target RAN energy consumption, reduction radio of energy consumption) and service experience (e.g. RAN UE throughput, latency), as well as the frequencies and RATs to be considered for energy saving. Some contexts for RAN energy saving (e.g. RAN energy saving allowed time (e.g., 1:00 am-5:00 am), RAN energy saving trigger event (e.g. PRB load ratio < 50%)) also can be specified by MnS consumer to provide the conditions to allow corresponding energy saving actions to be triggered to satisfy the energy saving targets. MnS producer analyses and determines the optimal RAN energy saving solution (i.e. a set of energy saving actions) to satisfy MnS consumer's intent expectation for RAN energy saving.MnS producer continuously monitors the RAN energy saving performance (e.g. RAN energy consumption, RAN energy efficiency) and service experience performance (e.g. target average UL/DL RAN UE throughput, target) for the specified area, and decides whether RAN energy saving target is satisfied.\nMnS producer may report the intent fulfilment information and achieved value for RAN energy saving targets (e.g. RAN energy consumption, RAN energy efficiency) for the specified area to MnS consumer which enables MnS consumer to monitor the intent containing an expectation for RAN energy saving.\nREQ-Intent_Opt_EnergySaving-1: The intent driven MnS for radio network shall have capabilites enabling MnS consumer to express intent containing an expectation for RAN energy saving for the specified area to MnS producer.\nREQ-Intent_ Opt_EnergySaving -2: The intent driven MnS for radio network shall have capabilites enabling MnS consumer to obtain intent report information (i.e. fulfilment information, achieved value for corresponding targets) of the intent containing an expectation for RAN energy saving.\n",

If an existing 5GC network is to be re-used, the intent driven MnS producer identifies the potential 5GC network performance issues (e.g. low performance because of high load ) for the existing 5GC network, modifies the 5GC NF configuration parameters if needed to satisfy the performance expectation targets (this may also trigger scaling procedure by interworking with ETSI NFV MANO).

In a network, multiple intent handling functions may be deployed to support different kinds of intents. Different intent handling functions may be deployed to support different intent expectation object domains, e.g. intent handling function A is deployed to handle the radio network related intents, intent handling function B is deployed to handle the 5GC network related intents, while intent handling function C is deployed to handle the service related intents.

The intent fulfilment information also can contain the current and optional predicted value for performance indicated by corresponding expectation targets (e.g. WeakRSRPRatio for the weakRSRPRatioTarget, Average UL RAN UE Throughput for aveULRANUEThptTarget), which can be used by MnS consumer to validate whether the intent is really fulfilled and to evaluate whether the intent (especially for expectation targets) needs to be updated if needed (improve the target value when corresponding target is fulfilled or reduce the target value when corresponding target is not fulfilled). Besides, intent conflict information and intent fulfilment feasibility check information sent by MnS producer to MnS consumer is another type of intent report information. So, following are the three types of information needs to be monitored by MnS consumer:\n-\tIntent Fulfilment information, which represents the properties of a specific fulfilment information for an aspect of the intent (i.e. either an expectation, a target or the whole intent), including fulfilment status and achieved values for targets.\n-\tIntent conflict information, which represents intent with conflict. The information includes conflict type (i.e., intent conflict, expectation conflict and target conflict) and possible solutions (e.g. intent deletion, intent modification).\n-\tIntent fulfilment feasibility check information, which indicates that the intent is feasible or infeasible. Intent fulfilment feasibility check information is provided after MnS producer automatically performs feasibility check when receiving the intent creation and modification request from MnS consumer.\nDifferent MnS consumer may have different requirements for intent report (e.g. Some MnS consumer may want to have corresponding performance value information while others do not want. Different MnS consumer may want to calculate or monitor the performance value in different period).\nMnS consumers may subscribe to get notifications of changes in the intent report.\nAn intent under fulfilment may go through multiple states, i.e., the life cycle includes multiple alternative transitions. The transitions are triggered either by actions of the MnS consumer or observations at the MnS producer or its intent handler. Generally, intents received at the MnS producer will have one of the states represented in Figure 5.3.A.1.\nFigure 5.3.2.1-1 illustrates the state transitions and reporting events for Intents delivered for fulfilment in a telecommunication system. The figure depicts the various states an Intent can undergo, including creation, assignment, fulfilment, and completion. Key components include the Intent Manager, which handles the lifecycle of the Intent, and the various states an Intent can transition through, such as New, Active, Completed, and Failed. The figure also shows the reporting events that occur during these transitions, such as Intent creation, assignment, and completion. The diagram provides a clear overview of the Intent lifecycle and the events and components involved in its management.\nFigure 5.3.2.1-1: State transitions and reporting events for Intents delivered for fulfilment.\nIntent reports should be delivered for each of these different states and related state transitions, specifically for:\n1.\tACKNOWLEDGED: When an intent is created, its default state is \"ACKNOWLEDGED\". An intent report should be delivered to indicate that the intent has been created. The transitions from \"ACKNOWLEDGED\" state can only be to \"COMPLIANT\", \"FULFILLMENT_FAILED\" or \"TERMINATED \" states as described hereafter.\n2.\tCOMPLIANT: When the feasibility check for the intent is successful and the intent is accepted as being compliant, the intent state is changed to \"COMPLIANT\". An intent report should be delivered to indicate the results of the feasibility check. In the case of an intent delivered for fulfillment, a corresponding intent report should be delivered to indicate the status change. The payload for the intent feasibility report (outcome of the feasibility check) may be one of the following:\n1.\ta indication for feasible or infeasible;\n2.\ta detailed report indicating which intent expectations or expectationTargets are feasible or not;\n3.\ta detailed report indicating the achievable outcomes on the individual intent expectations or expectationTargets.\nThe transitions from \"COMPLIANT\" state are either to \"ACKNOWLEDGED\" state when the intent attributes are modified by the MnS consumer, or to \"SUSPENDED\", \"FULFILLED\" or \"FULFILLMENT_FAILED\" states as described hereafter.\n3.\tSUSPENDED: If the MnS consumer decides to suspend the intent, the intent state changes to \"SUSPENDED\". Alternatively, an event may occur while the MnS producer attempts to fulfil the intent, in which case the Mns producer may suspend the intent pending further actions. Such events at the MnS producer may among others include conflicts from another intent and resource constraints. An intent report should be delivered to indicate that the intent has been suspended. The intent report may include a reason for the suspension in the case where the intent was suspended by the MnS producer.\nThe transitions from \"SUSPENDED\" state are either to \"ACKNOWLEDGED\" state when the intent attributes are modified by the MnS consumer, or to \"COMPLIANT\" state if the suspension is lifted by the entity (MnS consumer or MnS producer) that suspended the intent. Otherwise, the state is \"FULFILLMENT_FAILED\" if the intent is deleted.\n4.\tFULFILLED: If the MnS producer considers that the intent, expectation or target have been fulfilled as stated by the MnS consumer, the state changes to \"FULFILLED\". An intent report should be delivered to indicate that the intent has been fulfilled.\nThe transitions from \"FULFILLED\" state are either to \"ACKNOWLEDGED\" state when the intent attributes are modified by the MnS consumer or to \"DEGRADED\" as described for the \"DEGRADED\" state above.\n5.\tDEGRADED: If an intent that was previously fulfilled but after a period of observation it is found not be meeting the initially stated requirements, the state changes to \"DEGRADED\". An intent report should be delivered to indicate that the intent has degraded.\nThe transitions from \"DEGRADED\" state are either to \"ACKNOWLEDGED\" state when the intent attributes are modified by the MnS consumer, or to \"FULFILLED\" state if the MnS producer once again fulfills the intent.\n6.\tFULFILLMENT_FAILED: If the MnS producer determines that they cannot do anything to fulfil the intent, the state states to \"FULFILLMENT_FAILED\". An intent report should be delivered to indicate that the fulfillment of the intent has ceased. The intent is not deleted unless the MnS consumer explicitly requests for it to be deleted.\nThe only transition from \"FULFILLMENT_FAILED\" state is to \"ACKNOWLEDGED\" state when the intent attributes are modified by the MnS consumer.\n7.\tTERMINATED: If the MnS consumer requests to delete the intent, the state changes to \"TERMINATED\". An intent report should be delivered to indicate that the intent has been terminated.\nThere is no possible transition from TERMINATED state.\n8.\tThe intent may be modified when in any of the states \"ACKNOWLEDGED\", \"COMPLIANT \", \"SUSPENDED \" \"FULFILLED \", \"DEGRADED\" or \"FULFILLMENT_FAILED\". An intent report should be delivered to indicate that the intent has been modified.\n9.\tThe intent may be deleted when in any of the states \"ACKNOWLEDGED\", \"COMPLIANT \", \"SUSPENDED \" \"FULFILLED \", \"DEGRADED\" or \"FULFILLMENT_FAILED\".

The MnS producer (or its intent handling functions) may realize that the intent may have conflicts, within the intent, intent expectations or otherwise. The intent is considered to have conflict if any of its requirements (or their attributes) conflict with another requirement in the intent or in another intent. The conflicts should be detected and resolved.\nGiven two expectation targets, e.g., target_1=: throughput > V1 and target_2=: interference < V2, the MnS producer will see that the targets are conflicting if one target gets degraded while attempting to achieve the other, i.e., actions taken by the two targets have mutually exclusive effects. There is intent conflict if the targets are in different intents, expectation conflict if the targets are in the same intent but different intent expectations, otherwise it is a target conflict if both targets are in the same intent expectation. Accordingly, there are three intent related conflict scenarios:\n- \tTarget conflict, which represents the conflict between two or more expectation targets within the same intent expectation.\n-\tExpectation conflict, which represents the conflict between two or more intent expectations within the same intent.\n- \tIntent conflict, which represents the conflict between two or more different intents.\nWhen such conflicts are detected, the MnS producer needs to notify the MnS consumer about the conflict, indicating the intent, intent expectations or expectation targets which give rise to the conflict. The MnS producer may also notify the MnS consumer about additional information related to the conflict (e.g., the likely impact on other expectation targets).\nTo resolve the conflict, the MnS producer may derive required solutions, such as suspension of the whole intent that contains conflicts or has conflicts with another intent. Alternatively, the MnS producer may recommend a new intent in place of the conflict intent (e.g., adding recommended expectations or targets, or termination of part of intent). Also, the MnS producer may suggest alternative intent fulfilment e.g., by updating the execution time of the intent.\nThe decisions taken by the MnS producer may also be guided by the MnS consumer through explicit conflict handling guidelines. The MnS consumer may provide intent expectations and expectation targets as an ordered list for which the first intent expectations or expectation targets are the most important and should thus be prioritized in case of conflicts. Alternatively, the MnS consumer may assign explicit priorities for such intents or intent expectations or expectation targets so that the MnS producer uses the priorities to choose the intents or intent expectations or expectation targets to be discarded in favour of others. The priority mechanism not only applies to targets, but also to the expected managed entities (listed or scoped by the object context). The MnS consumer may also send the reduced scope of the expected managed entities in intent creation or modification request When the intent cannot be fulfilled in the expected managed entities.

The diagram serves as a valuable tool for understanding the complex interplay of management entities and their interactions in achieving the overall management objectives.\nFigure 6.2.1.1.2-1: Inheritance UML diagram for intent driven management\nThis IOC represents the properties of an Intent driven management information between MnS consumer and MnS producer.\nThe Intent IOC contains one or multiple IntentExpectation(s) which includes MnS consumer's requirements, goals and contexts given to a 3GPP system.\nThe Intent IOC also contains intentAdminState to support intent lifecycle management. In case MnS consumer wants to suspend an intent, MnS consumer can request MnS producer to configure attribute intentAdminState with the value \"DEACTIVATED\". A suspended intent means this intent is not considered for fulfillment. In case MnS consumer wants to resume an intent on the MnS producer side when the intent is suspended, MnS consumer can request MnS producer to configure attribute intentAdminState with the value \"ACTIVATED\".\nThe attribute \"observationPeriod\" indicates the time period for which the fulfilment process is observed and at the end of which the fulfilmentInfo for corresponding ExpectationTargets, IntentExpectations and Intent is updated. The observation period can be set by the MnS consumer or by the MnS producer if the MnS consumer does not provide a value.\nThe Intent IOC includes the attribute objectClass and objectInstance from the TOP IOC. The value of attribute objectClass is \"Intent\" and the value of attribute objectInstance is the DN of the instance of Intent IOC.\nThe Intent IOC includes contextSelectivity respectively used to define how to select among the stated intentContexts\nThe Intent IOC includes attributes inherited from Top IOC (defined in 3GPP TS 28.622 [6]) and the following attributes.\nTable 6.2.1.2.1.2-1\n\n\nThe common notifications defined in clause 6.2.1.5 are valid for this IOC. In addition, the following set of notifications is also valid.\n\nThis IOC represents intent report information from MnS producer to MnS consumer. The IntentReport instance is created by MnS producer automatically when creating an Intent instance. When the MnS producer delete an intent instance based on a request from MnS consumer, the corresponding intent report instance is also deleted by MnS producer automatically. They cannot be created nor deleted by MnS consumers.\nThe IntentReport IOC includes\n- intentFulfilmentReport, which represents the properties of fulfillment information for expectation target, intent expectation, and the whole intent. The fulfilmentReport will be observed from the start of each observation period (specified in Intent IOC), then at the end of each observation period, the corresponding values will be derived and configured.\n- intentConflictReport, which represents detected conflict information, including conflict type (i.e., intent conflict, expectation conflict and target conflict) and possible solution recommendations to address the conflicts.\n- intentFeasibilityCheckReport, which indicates that the intent is feasible or infeasible. Intent feasibility check information is provided after MnS producer automatically performs feasibility check when receiving the intent creation and modification request from MnS consumer.\nEach instance of IntentReport IOC can contain one or any combination of intentFulfilmentReport, intentConflictReport and intentFeasibilityCheckReport.\nDifferent MnS consumers can use the \"getMOIAttributeValue\" operation to query different attributes of the IntentReport <<IOC>> to obtain corresponding intent report information (including intentFulfilmentReport, intentConflictReport and intentFeasibilityCheckReport).\nDifferent MnS consumers can subscribe attribute value change notifications for IntentReport <<IOC>> to obtain the notification for different intent report information.\nThe IntentReport <<IOC>> includes attributes inherited from Top IOC (defined in TS 28.622 [6]) and the following attributes\nTable 6.2.1.2.2.2-1\n\nTable 6.2.1.2.2.3-1\n\nThe common notifications defined in clause 6.2.1.5 are valid for this IOC, without exceptions or additions\nThis IOC represents the intent handling capabilities can be supported by a specific intent handling function of MnS producer. IntentHandlingFunction instances are created by the MnS producer or are pre-installed, and also are modified, deleted by the MnS producer if needed. They cannot be created, modified and deleted by MnS consumers.\nAn MnS consumer can query the IntentHandlingFunction IOC to obtain the intent handling capability information for a specific intent handling function of MnS producer. Based on the obtained intent handling capability information and management requirements, MnS consumer generates the corresponding intent information and sends it to MnS producer. The intent information includes the expectation object and expectation targets supported by the obtained intent handing capabilities.\nThe MnS consumer also can use the DN of IntentHandlingFunction instance to query all Intent instances handled by a specific intent handling function.\nThe IntentHandlingFunction <<IOC>> includes attributes inherited from Top IOC (defined in TS 28.622 [6]) and the following attributes\nTable 6.2.1.2.3.2-1\nNone.\nThe common notifications defined in clause 6.2.1.5 are valid for this IOC, without exceptions or additions.\n6.2.1.3.1.1\tDefinition\nIntentExpectation <<dataType>>represents MnS consumer's requirements, goals and contexts given to a 3GPP system.\nThe IntentExpectation <<dataType>> includes contextSelectivity used to define how to select among the stated expectationContexts.\n6.2.1.3.1.2\tAttributes\nThe IntentExpectation includes the following attributes.\nTable 6.2.1.3.1.2-1\n\n6.2.1.3.1.3\tAttribute constraints\nNone.\nThe notifications specified for the IOC using this <<dataType>> for its attribute(s), shall be applicable.\n6.2.1.3.2.1\tDefinition\nThe ExpectationObject <<dataType>> represents the Object to which the IntentExpectation should apply.\nThe ExpectationTarget <<dataType>> includes a contextSelectivity used to define how to select among the stated targetContexts.\n6.2.1.3.2.2\tAttributes\nThe ExpectationObject includes the following attributes.\nTable 6.2.1.3.2.2-1\n\n6.2.1.3.2.3\tAttribute constraints\nTable 6.2.1.3.2.3-1\n\nThe ExpectationTarget <<dataType>> represents the target of the IntentExpectation that are required to be achieved.\nThe ExpectationTarget includes the following attributes.\nTable 6.2.1.3.3.2-1\n\nNone.\nThe notifications specified for the IOC using this <<dataType>> for its attribute(s), shall be applicable.\n6.2.1.3.4.1\tDefinition\nThe Context <<dataType>> represents the properties of a context. A context describes the condition. The context may apply to the intent, the intent expectation, the intent expectation targets or to the intent expectation object.\n6.2.1.3.4.2\tAttributes\nThe Context includes the following attributes.\nTable 6.2.1.3.4.2-1\n\n6.2.1.3.4.3\tAttribute constraints\nNone.\nThis dataType represents the properties of a specific fulfilment information for an aspect of the intent (i.e. either an expectation, a target or the whole intent). The fulfilment information describes the MnS producer's assessment of the degree to which a specific aspect of the intent is being fulfilled. The MnS consumer may however assess the fulfilment differently, e.g. the MnS consumer may evaluate the delivered outcome or network state to compute its fulfilment satisfaction.\nThe fulfilmentStatus field indicates whether the intent is being fulfilled or not being fulfilled. The possible values of the fulfilment include:\n-\tNOT_FULFILLED: This is the default status for any aspect of the intent and the fulfilmentStatus remains as \"NOT_FULFILLED\" until the MnS producer is satisfied that the actions undertaken meet the requirements as stated by the MnS consumer.\n-\tFULFILLED: This is the status if the MnS producer considers that the intent, expectation or target is being fulfilled as desired by the MnS consumer that created the intent. The consumer may provide a fulfilment satisfaction report that either confirms the fulfilment or describes its evaluation of the fulfilment.\nThe degree of fulfilment of an intent with the NOT_FULFILLED status may have multiple explanations and related states. These different progress states and conditions are recorded in the notFulfilledState field. The possible values of the notFulfilledState include:\n-\tACKNOWLEDGED: this is the default state and is the initial notFulfilledState right after the intent has been received.\n-\tCOMPLIANT: this is the state after the feasibility check has been run for the intent and the intent accepted as being compliant for fulfilment.\n-\tDEGRADED: this is the state if an intent that was previously fulfilled but after a period of observation it is found not be meeting the initially stated requirements.\n-\tSUSPENDED: this is the state if the MnS producer decides to suspect the fulfilment of the intent, expectation or target for whatever reason. This notFulfilledState shall be supported by a reason such as the event(s) that were observed when fulfilment was attempted.\n-\tTERMINATED: This state is registered if the respective aspect of the intent (i.e. either an expectation, a target or the whole intent) shall not be considered for fulfilment e.g. when an authorized MnS consumer sends an indication terminating the specific aspect of the intent. For instance, if the MnS consumer sends an update of the intent in which a particular target is eliminated, then that target shall be marked as cancelled.\n-\tFULFILMENTFAILED: This is the state when the MnS producer decides that the intent, expectation or target cannot be fulfilled. This state shall be supported by a reason such as the event(s) that were observed when fulfilment was attempted.\nFor some scenarios (in particular for the notFulfilledState with value \"DEGRADED\", “TERMINATED\", \"SUSPENDED\" and \"FULFILMENTFAILED\"), the notFulfilledState should be supported by extra information describing or related to the state. This extra information is recorded into the notFulfilledReasons field.\nThe FulfilmentInfo includes the following attributes.\nTable 6.2.1.3.5.2-1\n\nTable 6.2.1.3.5.3-1\n\nThe notifications specified for the IOC using this <<dataType>> for its attribute(s), shall be applicable.\nThis <<dataType>> includes the intentFulfilmentInfo and expectationFulfilmentResults. The intentFulfilmentInfo describes status of fulfilment of an intent and the related reasons for the infeasible status.\nThe IntentFulfilmentReport includes the following attributes.\nTable 6.2.1.3.6.2-1\nNone.\nExpectationFulfilmentResult <<dataType>> includes the expectationFulfilmentInfo and targetFulfilmentResults for each IntentExpectation. The expectationFulfilmentInfo describes status of fulfilment of an intentExpectation and the related reasons for the infeasible status.\nThe ExpectationFulfilmentResult includes the following attributes.\nTable 6.2.1.3.7.2-1\nNone.\nTargetFulfilmentResult <<dataType>> includes targetFulfilmentInfo and targetAchievedValue for each ExpectationTarget. The targetFulfilmentInfo describes status of fulfilment of an expectationTarget and the related reasons for the infeasible status. The targetAchievedValue describes current performance value for the ExpectationTarget.\nThe TargetFulfilmentResult includes the following attributes.\nTable 6.2.1.3.8.2-1\nNone.\nIntentConflictReport <<dataType>> represents the conflict information for the detected conflict.\nWhen a conflict is detected, the MnS producer will configure the value of attributes of IntentConflictReport and notify the MnS consumer about the conflict, indicating the intent, intent expectation or expectation target which give rise to the conflict. The value of recommendedsolutions may be configured by MnS producer and notified to MnS consumer.\nThe IntentConflictReport includes the following attributes.\nTable 6.2.1.3.9.2-1\n\n\nThe IntentFeasibilityCheckReport <<dataType>> represents the intent feasibility check information. Intent feasibility check information is provided after MnS producer automatically performs feasibility check when the MnS producer received the intent creation or modification request from the MnS consumer. In case the feasibility check result is 'INFEASIBLE' the MnS producer will notify the MnS consumer about the infeasible reasons.\nThe FeasibilityCheckReport includes the following attributes.\nTable 6.2.1.3.10.2-1\nTable 6.2.1.3.10.3-1\n\nThe IntentHandlingCapability <<dataType>> represents expectation object information and expectation target information which can be supported by a specific intent handling function of MnS producer.\nThe IntentHandlingCapability <<dataType>> includes a supportedExpectationObjectType and corresponding supportedExpectationTargetNames.\nThe IntentHandlingCapability includes the following attributes.\nTable 6.2.1.3.11.2-1\nNone.\nThis <<choice>> defines the data type for value of in the \"targetValueRange\" and \"contextValueRange\".\nTable 6.2.1.3.12.2-1\n\nTable 6.2.1.3.12.3-1\n\nIt describes the RF reference frequency (i.e. Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number) and/or the frequency operating band used for a given direction (UL or DL) in FDD or for both UL and DL directions in TDD.\nTable 6.2.1.3.13.2-1\n\nTable 6.2.1.3.13.3-1\n\nThis <<dataType>> describes the UE Group, which is represented by specific 5QI, specific S-NSSAI, or a specific combination of S-NSSAI and 5QI\nTable 6.2.1.3.14.2-1\n\nTable 6.2.1.3.14.3-1\n\nTable 6.2.1.4-1\n\nThis clause presents a list of notifications, defined in TS 28.532 [3], that an MnS consumer may receive.

MnS producer specify the intent based on intent priority level. Intent that is low-intent priority will become the target of intent deletion or intent modification. However, if two intents with the same priority conflict, it is impossible for MnS producer to specify the intent that is target of intent deletion or intent modification. In this case, the intent that is target of intent deletion or intent modification is identified using pre-emption. Based on pre-emption, the judgment is made using the attributes of \"intent pre-emption capability\". The \"intent pre-emption capability\" specify whether pre-emption shall be applied. The role of MnS Consumer and MnS Producer is as follows; MnS Consumer can set intent pre-emption capbility as \"T\" for priorited intent during pre-emption. MnS Producer decides the target of intent deletion or intent modification during pre-emption. Here, there are existing intent and new intent. When MnS Producer creates new intent, there is a conflict between the existing intent and new intent with same priority. If intent pre-emption capability=\"T\" for existing intent, target of intent deletion or intent modification is new intent. If intent pre-emption capability=\"F” for existing intent and intent pre-emption capability=\"T\" for new intent, target of intent deletion or intent modification will be existing intent.

            "description": "As the MnS producer's (i.e. 3gpp system) capabilities (e.g. number and/or availability of the system resources) can change even after the Intent is accepted by the MnS producer, the Intent content (i.e. a list of Intent Expectations) might not be best aligned with the MnS producer' capabilities. For example, the resources in MnS producer are overbooked, and the intent content is failing to meet expectations of the MnS consumer or the resources of the MnS producer become underbooked which makes such a solution very expensive and therefore useless. Hence the creation/adjustment of an Intent content (i.e. a list of Intent Expectations) and keeping it aligned with the MnS producer's capabilities, can be automated.\nThis means that the life cycle of the Intent can begin before Intent content is retrieved by the MnS producer, e.g. the Intent content is being defined in a MnS consumer based on requirements towards a MnS producer (e.g. to deliver a service with certain characteristics), then be optimized based on the MnS producer's capabilities (e.g. availability of MnS Producer resources in certain area, time, etc.), then be refined if the initially captured requirement needs further detalization, etc.\nThe intent lifecycle consists of the following phases.\nFigure B.1-1 illustrates the various phases of the intent lifecycle in a telecommunication system, starting from the initial user query to the successful completion of the service. The figure outlines the different stages, including intent capture, intent routing, intent processing, intent fulfillment, and intent feedback. Key components such as the intent capture system, intent processing center, and fulfillment modules are depicted, emphasizing the intricate coordination between these components to ensure a seamless user experience. The figure also highlights the importance of real-time monitoring and optimization for efficient intent management.\nFigure B.1-1: Intent Lifecycle Phases\nDetection:\nIn the detection phase, the MnS Consumer as the system generating the intent content (a list of expectations), identifies if there is a need to define new or change/remove existing intent expectations to set requirements, goals, and constraints. The MnS Consumer has its own terminal expectations to fulfill. It would break its terminal expectations down into a suitable set of detailed instrumental expectations. Typically, these instrumental expectations need to be fulfilled by other management functions and domains and therefore they need to be not only defined but distributed to suitable MnS producer. In the detection phase, the MnS consumer can react to changes in its own terminal expectations or to changes in the fulfillment in its instrumental expectations. In this respect the MnS consumer deriving the expectations will need to collect information about the expectation' fulfillment. Intent reports coming from MnS producer, as a system to receive intent expectations are one source for this information. Through intent reports the MnS Consumer is able to react on intent handling outcomes in the MnS producer. In any case it is task of the MnS consumer to assure the fulfillment of its terminal expectations and the first step is to detect if any changes are needed in its instrumental expectations.\nInvestigation:\nIn the investigation phase, the MnS Consumer finds out what intent content (a list of expectations) are feasible. This has two aspects: first, it needs to find right MnS producer that have the right domain responsibilities and support the intent expectations the MnS consumer wants to define. MnS producer capability management and detection would be used for this process.\nThe other aspect of investigation would be finding out if the wanted intent expectations are realistic. This means, if the MnS producer would be able to successfully reach the wanted expectations. This depends on the current resource situation and capabilities of the system and can vary over time. Typically, the feasibility of intent expectations is done through a guided negotiation process between the MnS Producer and MnS Consumer. The MnS Consumer can explore what the handling result of wanted intent expectations would be, what would be the best result the MnS producer can achieve, or what would be the most challenging requirements, the aspiring MnS producer can offer to fulfill.\nDefinition:\nAt the end of the investigation phase the MnS consumer knows what is possible and what the MnS producer to be involved. By combining this information with the needs that were identified in detection, the MnS Consumer can now decide and plan all needed intent expectations. In the definition phase the MnS consumer formulates the intent expectations it needs to use.\nDistribution:\nIn the distribution phase the MnS Consumer contacts a MnS producer in order to create a new intent object or modify or change an existing one to include the intent expectations derived in the Definition phase. This way the MnS consumer acts on the plan it has made in definition phase. In this phase a MnS producer starts handling the intent expectations by receiving them and included in the intent object. The MnS producer decides if it can accept the intent expectations. If not, it would send a report with the rejection reason back to the MnS consumer. While this finishes the lifecycle of this particular intent, the MnS consumer can start over with detection to create a new plan. If the MnS producer accepts the intent, it starts operating based on it.\nOperation:\nEach intent expectations yet another set of requirements, goals and constraints to be considered for decisions and actions by the MnS producers. The MnS producers operate their domains of responsibility according to the given intent expectations. They also report back to the MnS consumer about status and success while continuously reacting to intent fulfillment threats. Intent reports would be evaluated by the MnS consumer as part of its detection process, which leads to the next iteration of the intent life cycle.\nThe TM forum defines the structure of an intent as a list of expectations with each expectation containing the requirements goals and constraints to be achieved. The expectation is defined to contain 3 attributes - the icm:target, icm:propertyParams and the icm:deliveryParams.\nTable C.1 illustrates the mapping between 3GPP Intent Expectation and TM Forum ICM IntentExpectation.\nTable C.1.
