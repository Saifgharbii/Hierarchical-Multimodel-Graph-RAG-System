            "description": "The existing Rel-15 NR FR2 minimum UE requirements are defined with an assumption that UE is equipped with a single antenna panel or two antenna panels but only capable to perform DL reception using a single RX beam/chain reception. Furthermore, the UE performance requirements are limited for DL MIMO rank 1 and 2. In FR2, 4-layer MIMO reception requires beam reception from at least two directions. Although this is supported by the MIMO features since Rel-15, no performance requirements have yet been specified. This is important for high-rate MIMO in FR2, as well as for FR2 HST scenarios.\nDuring Rel-16 and Rel-17, the support of NR FR2 CA with IBM (Independent Beam Management) with simultaneous DL reception on different component carriers from the co-located and non-col-located TRPs was defined. The IBM concept implies a UE is capable of DL simultaneous reception on different UE panels/chains using separate beams on different component carriers and requires improved UE baseband and RF capabilities (multiple baseband chains and support of multiple antenna panels).\nSeveral enhancements to enable efficient and robust DL multi-TRP/panel operation were introduced in the Rel-16 NR eMIMO WI. For instance, DL transmission schemes with simultaneous and non-simultaneous multi-beam reception from multiple TRPs/panels were introduced. The simultaneous reception may require support of simultaneous multi-panel operation with several independent RX beams/chains at the UE side. As part of this item, a new FR2 UE capability for simultaneous multi-beam reception was introduced (simultaneousReceptionDiffTypeD-r16). However, no RF, RRM or performance requirements were defined in Rel-16 and Rel-17 for FR2 UEs with simultaneousReceptionDiffTypeD-r16 capability.\nEnhanced NR FR2 UEs with multi-beam simultaneous reception and multiple RX chains can provide a meaningful performance improvement in FR2 improving both demodulation performance (4-layer DL MIMO), RRM performance and improve RF spherical coverage. This work item aims to introduce the requirements for UEs capable of multi-beam/chain simultaneous DL reception on a single component carrier to achieve improved RF, RRM and UE demodulation performance.\nDifferent implementation scenarios could be considered at the UE. Single-TCI reception on different beams has been supported by the RAN1 specifications since Rel-15 via the Type I codebook, which could be achieved at the UE with either a single panel or multiple panels. Alternatively, dual TCI operation can be combined with the Rel-17 mTRP framework even if the base station is actually deployed as a single TRP.\nThis WI therefore provides the requirements for both single and dual TCI assumptions to specify requirements for reception of 4-layer downlink MIMO with simultaneous reception at the UE from two different directions.\n",

For option 3, there are two variants: the first one uses the legacy positioner with 2 axes (either distributed or otherwise), and the second one uses an enhanced positioner with 3 degrees of freedom (3-axis positioner).\n\nFigure 5.1.1-1 Illustration for fixed relative AoA separation\n",

Also evident is that for probe in the xz plane in the example system and a constant step-size grid, the regularity of the grid is preserved for both sources. Consequently, TE sources/probes that lie in the plane of constant phi with respect to the coordinate system defined by the positioner axes and a constant-step grid is considered as the primary configuration for test setup and requirement discussion.\n",

RAN4 has agreed that UE RF requirements for simultaneous reception from different directions shall be based on single-layer reception for each DL direction with dual TCI configuration, i.e., total 2 layers for both directions. Existing Reference Measurement Channel (RMC) for UE RF requirement is limited to 1 layer, thus it is necessary to specify new RMC for 2 layer scenario for UE RF.\nDepending on the DCI schemes the UE supports, RMC may be different.\nFor multi-DCI, transport blocks are separated for receptions from different directions, therefore throughput for each layer could be separately obtained. From the perspective of each TRP, the legacy RMC can be reused;\nFor single DCI, transport block is split across both TRPs for single DCI, therefore only an overall throughput of the 2 layer reception can be obtained.

One is based on 2AoA directional sensitivity statistics, which is similar to the legacy REFSENS and spherical coverage, e.g., “joint” sensitivity, sensitivity tolerance, new CCDF formula, etc., and the details of proposals can be found in [5]. The most critical problem with this approach is that when two AoAs need to search for sensitivity simultaneously, the test complexity rises significantly. Another is based on the functionality verification under 2AoAs with a fixed DL power level [6], and the merit of this approach is that it can reduce the test overhead, but the concern is that such simplification may not reasonably validate UE performance. In [7], the simulation results to compare these two approaches above are provided.\nTable 6.1.1 Simulation results for PC3 UE under different requirement concept\n\nThe results show that there is good correlation between the coverages predicted by the two methods. To alleviate the test overhead for multi-Rx UE, the functionality verification with fixed DL power is agreed as requirement concept.\n",

However, from RF requirement design perspective, a clear meaning of “panel” is very helpful for the discussion, and the following logical “panel” definition is used which is only focus on its behaviour rather than physical implementation.\n“Panel” is defined as a group of antenna element that controls beam independently and has the following attributes\n-\tWithin a panel, one beam can be selected and used for DL reception.\n-\tAcross different panels, multiple beams (each selected per panel) may be used for DL reception.\n-\t‘Beam’ is assumed to mean spatial filter associated with reception.\n-\tA physical panel with dual polarization is assumed as two “panels”.\n",

                            "text_content": "Two similar proposals were made along with the respective mathematical framework. Both aim to capture the probability of supporting 2 AoA reception for a given AoA separation but differ in the weighting assigned to the outcomes of all tested pairs. One method aims to capture the overall probability based on evaluation over the entire sphere, while the other limits evaluation to some subset of AoA pairs.\nThe ideal metric for the requirement is the probability of supporting 2AoA reception when the 2 AoAs are randomly selected. This is the general case, assuming no TE constraints. To this end, a regional probability metric is first established to capture the probability of a UE to support 2TRP Rx, given a fixed (regional) location of one of the TRPs (from the UE’s perspective). The sample space for this probability is the collection of all AoA pairs formed from TRP2 locations that cover the entire sphere (blue surface in the ‘ideal case’ in figure 6.1.3.2-1) and a given TRP1 location (white star in the ‘ideal case’ in figure 6.1.3.2-1).\n\nFigure 6.1.3.2-1: ‘Regional Probability’ sample space for the general AoA pair case\nSpecifically, for the fixed TRP (‘TRP1’) at some AoA (1,1), the regional probability is evaluated as a spatial average of the pass/fail outcomes for all locations of TRP2.:\n\nWhere:\n-\tThe AoA of the fixed TRP (‘TRP1’) is (1,1).\n-\tThe AoA of the TRP paired with the fixed TRP (‘TRP2’) is (2,2).\n-\tPF (1,1,2,2) is the pass/fail outcome (1/0 respectively) of the 2TRP functionality test under the agreed UERF test conditions.\n-\tdS2 is the elemental area associated with the AoA of TRP2\nAn overall probability that a UE can support 2TRP operation when the TRPs are positioned randomly around the UE can be defined by taking a spatial average of the regional probability over all possible positions of the fixed TRP on the sphere:\n\nThis expression can be re-written as:\n\nWhile this overall probability was derived by arbitrarily choosing a TRP whose location was fixed for the regional probability, the final expression is symmetric for both TRPs. We can therefore conclude that the choice of the specific TRP to use as the ‘fixed TRP’ for the calculation is not significant, at least for the general case where there are no restrictions on availability of test AoA pairs.\nThe regional probability formulation above is now modified for discrete sampling on for a lat-long (constant step-size grid). The expression for constrained probability becomes a weighted sum over all sample points:\n\nWhere:\n-\tAW(x) are the area weights associated with the entire sample space of grid points where TRPx can be located. In this case, the weights would be the discretized version of  , or\nThe overall probability can similarly be discretized as:\n\nWhere AW shares the same meaning as defined above.\nThis formulation highlights that if the regional probability can be established for every point on the sphere, it is possible to define an overall probability for the UE. It further highlights that it is possible to decouple the grid used to define the regional probabilities and the grids used by the paired TRP directions to compute the regional probabilities.\n\nTo modify the formulation above to reflect TE constraints where each grid point (blue star in figure 2.1.3-1) is paired with just 2 unique grid points (green stars in figure 6.1.3.2-2) the equation for the metric can be rewritten as:\n\nWhere the regional constrained probability calculated at each grid point is modified to depend on a reduced set of test AoA pairs.\n\n\nFigure 6.1.3.2-2: ‘Constrained Regional Probability’ sample space for the case constrained by practical TE considerations\nThere are multiple ways to quantify this constrained regional probability, described in subsections below.\n\nIn this method, the constrained regional probability for each point is considered ‘1’ if that point is successful in at least one of the AoA pairs it participates in. This strategy represents the ‘OR combining’ method.\n\n\nNote that mathematical formulation of the regional probability in the general case shows it to be a weighted sum of all P/F outcomes. The area weights are those associated with the entire sample space of grid points that contribute to the weighted sum. When the entire sample domain for the constrained regional probability consists only of 2 sample points, the weights for each sample in that sample space equal 0.5. The arithmetic mean method for a small number of equidistant points is therefore consistent with the general formulation for regional probability:\n\nRecall that if the AoAs of the two TRPs can be arbitrary values rather than with a fixed offset in between, a full double surface integral needs to be performed to sweep through all the possible combinations of AoA1  and AoA2 to calculate the probability P that the device can successfully connect to two TRPs\n(6.1.3.3-1)\nwhere\n(6.1.3.3-2)\n(6.1.3.3-3)\nif both panels have SINR larger than -1 dB; otherwise, it equals 0. In this case, it can be observed that the corresponding weight factor for each TRP pair should be .\nNow consider that only a fixed offset would be applied to between AoA1 and AoA2, the same weight factor can still be used if we see this as a subset of the full double surface integral. However, since a constant offset between AoA1 and AoA2 needs to be applied (e.g., AoA2 = AoA1+ offset), a Dirac delta function needs to be plugged into the integral  , so that we only count the AoA pairs which has the required offset.\nAssuming a case that the offset is only applied to plane, e.g., , where c is a constant offset, the integral of f  in 6.1.3.3-2 becomes  as below. Please note that since  is from 0° to 180°,  needs to be wrapped within the same range.\n(6.1.3.3-4)\nby integral over  and  , the double surface integral will be degraded to a single surface integral, as shown in 6.1.3.3-5. The detail of derivation can be found in the appendix.\n(6.1.3.3-5)\nMoreover, to correctly calculate the probability, the total weight  (assuming all test points can pass the SINR threshold -1dB) also needs to be correctly computer as well. For a completed double surface integral, the total weight  equals (4π)2. However, for the subset that has a fixed offset between AoA1 and AoA2, the total weight   varies with the AoA offset values, which are shown in Figure 6.1.3.3-1. The value is computed numerically with the integral below but with constrain that  should be wrapped within the range from [0° 180°].\n(6.1.3.3-6)\nFigure 6.1.3.3-1 illustrates the total weight with different AoA offset values, showcasing the impact of antenna orientation angle of arrival on the system performance. The graph displays the relationship between the total weight and the AoA offset, with various data points representing different scenarios. The figure highlights the importance of optimizing antenna orientation to enhance system efficiency and reliability.\nFigure 6.1.3.3-1 The total weight  with different AoA offset values\nWith  and  , the percentage of spherical coverage can be computed. As the results are weighted per TRP pair, the + offset and -offset pairs will be treated as two pairs or samples. The coverage probability  can be computed as:\n\nAfter considering the Pros and Cons of different methods, RAN4 agreed to use overall probability with arithmetic mean combining as the metric for this feature.\n",

The following options were discussed to accommodate simulation data that is typically much better than the standard:\nOption 1: Adjust the beam shape or scale the antenna gain to make UE align with both peak EIS and spherical coverage.\n\nOption 2: Adjust the fixed DL power to align with real UE spherical coverage power level, e.g., if the spherical coverage in spec is -74.4 dBm with 10.9 dB gain drop and the UE only have 6 dB gain drop, then the fixed DL power need to be adjusted to -79.3 in the simulation.\n\nOption 3: Meet any one calibration condition as long as the other condition is met or exceeded. Two examples:\n-\tIf a UE only has 6 dB drop from peak to 50th %ile, but the standards requirement for that parameter is 11 dB, the proposed calibration condition would be to align the peak direction to the REFSENS condition.\n-\tIf a UE has 15 dB drop from peak to 50th %ile, but the standards requirement for that parameter is 11 dB, the proposed calibration conditions would be to align the 50th %ile direction to the spherical coverage EIS condition.\nThe intention of calibration is to ensure that simulation results are comparable across all companies when performance of antenna module or other detailed simulation setup are different, so there should be a datum line existing after the calibration is performed. Based on this principle, both option 1 and option 2 can be used as calibration method, and then overall probability of PC3 UE will not exceed the 50% for any UE under any AoA offset.\n\n",

Furthermore, with varying power levels, the testing overhead is expected to increase as multiple power levels need to be tested.\nAs for the exact DL power level, there were several proposals:\nOption 1: Use different DL power levels for the two AoAs.\nTo ensure not to degrade the coverage compared with single DL reception, the spherical coverage requirement of 50th %-tile of the CCDF of EIS measured for one of the DL directions should be equal or close to the legacy requirement. DL power level for the other DL direction can be relaxed with respect to the AoA separation.\nOption 2: Both DL powers are higher that legacy spherical coverage requirement\nSince the two-AoA spherical coverage requirements for simultaneous multi-Rx chain DL reception cannot meet the legacy spherical coverage requirements for the single direction considering the mutual interference between the beams from two AoAs, and simultaneously choosing best Rx beam peak direction from two AoAs for all possible AoAs separation pairs cannot be guaranteed, it is proposed to define Z dBm tolerance for simultaneous multi-Rx chain DL reception.\nIn addition, some relaxation compared to the legacy spherical coverage EIS level is proposed to account for polarization impairments in commercial UEs that are not fully reflected in simulation.\nOption 3: Both DL powers are same as the legacy spherical coverage requirement EIS level\nThis option argues that the legacy spherical coverage EIS level should be reused as the DL power in the requirement, based on which the two-AoA coverage probability can be derived accordingly.\nIn the end, the EIS level of the legacy spherical coverage requirement, e.g., specified in Table 7.3.4.3-1: EIS spherical coverage for power class 3 in TS 38.101-2, is chosen.

An example of inter-beam interference observed at the UE in a multi-TRP DL transmission scenario is shown in Figure 6.3.2-1 which demonstrates that the signal (S2) transmitted from TRP2 creates interference to the UE antenna panel receiving the signal (S1) transmitted from TRP1; h11 (h12) is the path gain/loss of the channel between the TRP1 (TRP2) and the UE, and P_h11 (P_h12) is the corresponding power.\nFigure 6.3.2-1 illustrates a typical user equipment (UE) beam radiation pattern, focusing on the desired signal from angle of arrival (AoA) 1 and the interference from angle of arrival (AoA) 2. The figure demonstrates the impact of different antenna patterns and beamforming techniques on signal quality and interference mitigation. The graph shows how the beam radiation pattern varies with different antenna elements and beamforming strategies, highlighting the importance of optimizing these parameters for efficient communication. The figure also highlights the potential for co-channel interference and the need for advanced signal processing techniques to ensure reliable communication.\nFigure 6.3.2-1: UE beam radiation pattern example for wanted signal from AoA1 and interference from AoA2\nTo study the effect of inter-beam interference in multi-TRP DL transmission, a UE equipped with three antenna arrays/modules/panels (each on its top, left and right surfaces) is assumed where each antenna array can steer the beam in seven different directions as shown in Figure 6.3.2-2, namely:\n1.\tBeam set for Antenna Array #1 (7 beams shown in variation of blue color),\n2.\tBeam set for Antenna Array #2 (7 beams shown in variation of green color),\n3.\tBeam set for Antenna Array #3 (7 beams shown in variation of red color),\nFigure 6.3.2-2 illustrates a FR2 (Frequency Range 2) user equipment (UE) equipped with three antenna panels, each featuring seven beams. This advanced configuration enables the UE to achieve high-speed data transmission and improved signal reception in the 28 GHz band, which is crucial for 5G networks. The multiple beams and antenna panels work together to create a more comprehensive and reliable connection, ensuring seamless communication and reduced latency.\nFigure 6.3.2-2: FR2 UE with 3 antenna panels with 7 beams for each panel\nwhere the description of 7 beams selected from any beam set (group) is provided in Table 6.3.2-1.\nTable 6.3.2-1: Beam index and description for a UE antenna panel\n\nFigure 6.3.2.1-1 shows the standalone configuration with 1x4 UE antenna arrays and angular range over which each one of the 21 beams (7 beams on each of the three antenna modules) is dominant and has the highest RSRP over the other beams and Figure 6.3.2.1-2 shows the example UE beam radiation pattern receiving the desired signal from the direction of AoA1 on the main lobe and the interference signal from the direction of AoA2 on the side lobe.\nFigure 6.3.2.1-1 presents two configurations of a standalone antenna array, illustrating the angular range for dominant beams. Configuration (a) shows a single antenna with a narrow beamwidth, ideal for focused communication within a specific direction. Configuration (b) displays multiple antennas with wider beamwidths, allowing for broader communication across various angles. These configurations are crucial for optimizing signal strength and coverage in telecommunication networks.            Figure 6.3.2.1-1 presents two configurations of a standalone antenna array, illustrating the angular range for dominant beams. Configuration (a) shows a single antenna with a narrow beamwidth, ideal for focused communication within a specific direction. This configuration is useful for maximizing signal strength and minimizing interference in a targeted area. Configuration (b) displays multiple antennas with wider beamwidths, allowing for broader communication across various angles. This configuration is crucial for optimizing signal strength and coverage in telecommunication networks, as it enables the antenna array to adapt to different user locations and environmental conditions.\nFigure 6.3.2.1-1: (a) Standalone antenna array configuration, (b) Angular range for dominant beams\nFigure 6.3.2.1-2 illustrates the user equipment (UE) beam radiation pattern for angle of arrival (AoA) 1 and the interference from angle of arrival (AoA) 2. The figure depicts the radiation pattern of the UE in a sector, with the horizontal axis representing the azimuth angle and the vertical axis representing the elevation angle. The radiation pattern shows the strength of the signal as a function of both the angle of arrival and the distance from the UE. The interference from AoA 2 is represented by a dashed line, showing the impact of the interference on the signal strength. The figure highlights the importance of accurate beamforming and interference management in modern wireless communication systems.\nFigure 6.3.2.1-2: UE beam radiation pattern for AoA1 and interference from AoA2\nConsidering AoA offset of 90o and the beam radiation patterns of two panels, one in red and one in blue, receive the signals from two TRPs are shown in Figure 6.3.2.1-2, ‘Green Circle’ and ‘Red Circle’ on the red beam radiation pattern will denote the received power of the wanted signal from one TRP and the interference signals (e.g. AoA1) from the other TRP (e.g., AoA2), and subsequently the signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR) can be defined as the ratio of the antenna gain values corresponding to the ‘Green Circle’ to that of the ‘Red Circle’. In general, this interference power/gain is due to the sidelobe of the beam radiation pattern receives the unwanted signal from the other AoA.\nNext, the CCDF plot of SIR of AoA1 is presented for the case when Array #1’s Boresight beam is used for the reception of the wanted signal from TRP1, whereas one of the 14 beams of Array #2/Array #3 is used for the reception of the wanted signal from AoA2.\nFigure 6.3.2.1-3 illustrates the Conditional Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of the Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) for Angle of Arrival (AoA) 1, which is a key metric in evaluating the performance of a wireless communication system. The CCDF provides a comprehensive understanding of the system's reliability by showing the probability that the SIR is greater than a given threshold. The figure shows that the probability of achieving a high SIR is relatively high, indicating that the system is robust and can handle interference effectively. The figure also shows that the probability of achieving a low SIR is relatively low, indicating that the system is able to maintain a high level of performance even under challenging conditions. Overall, the figure provides valuable insights into the performance of the wireless communication system and can be used to make informed decisions about system design and optimization.\nFigure 6.3.2.1-3: CCDF of AoA1’s SIR\nTo evaluate the CCDF, the antenna radiation pattern with 1o resolution in azimuth and elevation domain is used providing 65160 constant step size grid points and then 2500 points are selected to approximate an uniform density grid. These selected points are then sorted in a descending order and are plotted as the CCDF curves.\nThe legend ‘Array x-Beam y’ where  and  to be interpreted as described in Figure 6.3.2-2 and Table 6.3.2-1. Figure 6.3.2.1-3 shows the CCDF of SIR of AoA1 for the case when the antenna panels are configured in a standalone fashion as shown in Figure 6.3.2.1-1(a) and the interference signal coming from AoA2 direction aligns with the direction of one of the 14 beams of Array#2 and Array#3 and hence creates different interference scenarios to the signal received at ‘Array 1-Beam 4’, resulting in different CCDF curves in Figure 6.3.2.1-3.\nFrom Figure 6.3.2.1-3, the SIR values corresponding to the 50th percentile of the CCDF curves is shown in Table 6.3.2.1-1 where it is worth noting that the interference from the TRP2 signals arriving from the AoA2 direction becomes significant when the angular separation between AoA1 and AoA2 is low.\n\nTable 6.3.2.1-1: SIR at 50-percentile of CCDF of Figure 6.3.2.1-3\n\nThe electromagnetic simulations of a realistic smartphone Mechanical Computer Aided Design (M-CAD) assumes that front and rear surfaces of the smartphone are made up of glass, chassis is metallic and frame is made up of plastic (see Figure 6.3.2.2-1 andTable 6.3.2.2-1 below for more details). Furthermore, the UE is assumed to have one antenna array/module/panel on each of its left, top, and right surfaces; each antenna module is a standalone uniform linear array of four single polarized antenna elements placed half a wavelength apart from each other.\n\nFigure 6.3.2.2-1 provides a detailed view of a realistic smartphone's M-CAD (Mobile Communications Architecture Diagram).

The baseband processor is responsible for managing data traffic and processing signals, while the RF transceiver is in charge of transmitting and receiving radio frequency signals. The antenna plays a vital role in capturing and transmitting radio waves, and other hardware components ensure the smooth functioning of the smartphone's communication system.\n\nThe diagram also emphasizes the significance of signal processing and modulation techniques in improving the overall performance and reliability of the smartphone's communication system. These techniques are crucial for optimizing data transmission, reducing interference, and enhancing the overall user experience. By analyzing this diagram, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex architecture and design principles that underpin modern smartphone communication systems.\nFigure 6.3.2.2-1: Details of a realistic smartphone M-CAD\n\nTable 6.3.2.2-1: Material parameters for electromagnetic simulations\n\nFigure 6.3.2.2-2 illustrates the angular range for dominant beams of a realistic formfactor smart-phone User Equipment (UE). The figure depicts the beam patterns of a typical smartphone, showing the main directions in which the device can effectively transmit and receive signals. This information is crucial for understanding the communication capabilities of mobile devices and optimizing network resources. The figure highlights the importance of beamforming techniques in improving signal quality and reducing interference, particularly in crowded or cluttered environments.\nFigure 6.3.2.2-2: Angular range for dominant beams of a realistic formfactor smart-phone UE\nFigure 6.3.2.2-2 shows the angular range over which each one of the 21 beams of a realistic formfactor smart-phone UE is dominant. Similar to Section 6.3.2.1, the assumption is that the boresight beam of Antenna Array #1 is the dominant beam used for receiving the signals from AoA1 whereas the AoA2’s dominant beam must be selected from the remaining 14 beams of Antenna Array #2 and #3. Next, the plot of CCDF of SIR of AoA1 for a realistic formfactor smart-phone UE is presented.\nFigure 6.3.2.2-3 illustrates the Central Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of the Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) for a realistic form-factor smartphone User Equipment (UE) when the angle of arrival (AoA) is 1. The CCDF is a statistical measure that represents the probability that the SIR is less than or equal to a given value. The figure shows that the probability of having a poor SIR (below a certain threshold) is relatively low, indicating a high likelihood of achieving a satisfactory level of communication quality. The CCDF curve is a key performance indicator for evaluating the reliability of wireless communication systems.\nFigure 6.3.2.2-3: CCDF of AoA1’s SIR for a realistic formfactor smart-phone UE\nIn Figure 6.3.2.2-3, it is observed that due to the change of the beam shapes caused by the surrounding components in the real mobile phone, the difference of CCDF of SIR become less compared with those based on the analysis of the ideal beams in Figure 6.3.2.1-3. However, it is again observed that the performance of Array 2-Beam 7 and Array 3-Beam 7 is worst compared to the other 12 beams of Array 2 and Array 3 as the CCDF curves for these two beams is relatively located in the leftmost region. Furthermore, the SIRs corresponding to ‘Array 2-Beam 5’/‘Array 3-Beam 5’ and ‘Array 2-Beam 6’/‘Array 3-Beam 6’ are higher compared with that of ‘Array 2-Beam 7’/‘Array 3-Beam 7’. This is aligned with the previous results that the SIR increases as the angular separation between AoAs increases.\nTable 6.3.2.2-2: SIR at 50-percentile of CCDF of Figure 6.3.2.2-3\n\nThe SIR values corresponding to the 50th percentile of the CCDF curves of Figure 6.3.2.2-3 is shown in Table 6.3.2.2-2. It is also observed from Table 6.3.2.1-1 and Table 6.3.2.2-2 that there is a significant difference (up to 16 dB in the ideal case and up to 5 dB in the practical case) between the SIR at 50-percentile of CCDF (dB) for different AoA offset scenarios.\nThe spherical coverage is worse if the AoA offset is small and spherical coverage becomes better if the AoA offset is larger which share the same trends. However, in Figure 6.3.2.2-3, it is observed that the plots corresponding to ‘Array 2-Beam 1’ and ‘Array 3-Beam 1’ (shown in brown colour) shows that the beam with largest AoA separation might not be the best beam in all the cases. The intuitive reasoning behind this is that depending on the beam pattern, the gain of the side lobe of the beam receiving signals from AoA1 might be large or small in the direction of AoA2 which is illustrated in the Figure 6.3.2-1.\nThe important observations of inter-beam interference study can be summarized as follows:\n1.\tFor small AoA offset scenario, the effect of inter-beam interference will be large.\n2.\tWith increasing AoA offset, the effect of inter-beam interference reduces.\n3.\tThe largest AoA offset scenario might not have lowest inter-beam interference due to the significant side lobe gain of the UE beam radiation pattern at that AoA offset.\n4.\tThe UE beam radiation pattern, gain of the side lobes, AoA offset will have a direct impact on the inter-beam interference effect.\n\n",

The figure depicts a test scenario with various stages, including initial setup, data collection, and analysis. It highlights the challenges of conducting tests in real-world conditions, such as limited resources, time constraints, and the need for skilled personnel. The figure emphasizes the importance of considering these practical factors when designing and executing progressive tests to ensure accurate and reliable results.\nFigure 6.3.3-1 Progressive test limitations due to practical considerations\nA corollary is that given the agreed test system constraints, a complete test implies every AoA for each TRP is paired with 2 AoAs associated with the other TRP. Unfortunately, s simple 2TRP scan like legacy practice under fixed AoA separation does not exercise the UE with all AoA pairs the TE can produce. The post processed data (CCDF of sensitivity, relative to REFSENS) collected from the 2TRP scan shows bias for the following conditions:\n1.\tA pair of UEs that have mirror image coverage patterns can show different statistics for the coverage of the two TRPs. See left sub-figure in figure 6.3.3-2. (Mirror image UEs: UE with modules in the top + left faces versus a UE with modules in the top + right faces)\n2.\tA given UE can register different statistics for a TRP depending on whether the second TRP is introduced at a positive or negative AoA separation See right sub-figure in figure 6.3.3-2.\nFigure 6.3.3-2 illustrates the impact of not exercising the User Equipment (UE) over all possible Antenna Angle of Arrival (AoA) pairs. The figure depicts a telecommunication network with multiple base stations (BSs) and UEs, each with its own AoA. The visual representation shows the potential gains in terms of signal strength and coverage when the UE is exercised over all possible AoA pairs, as opposed to a scenario where the UE is only exercised over a subset of these pairs. The figure emphasizes the importance of optimizing the UE's movement and positioning within the network to maximize overall network performance and efficiency.\nFigure 6.3.3-2: Impact of not exercising the UE over all possible AoA pairs\nTo dig deeper into why a UE with symmetric behaviour for both TRPs should exhibit different post-processed data associated with each TRP, it is useful to study the grid quality in further detail. Figure 6.3.3-3 graphically shows the TRP coverage patterns with the 2TRP scan identified in the previous section. The grids covered by both TRPs are identical, but each location for each TRP only shows one paired AoA.\nFigure 6.3.3-3 illustrates the missing Angle of Arrival (AoA) pairs in a 2-Transceivers Round Robin (2TR) protocol scan. The figure shows the AoA estimation results for a typical indoor environment, with the x-axis representing the number of antennas and the y-axis representing the number of unique AoA pairs. The missing AoA pairs are indicated by the shaded area, suggesting that the 2TRP scan may not have captured all the necessary information for accurate channel state information (CSI) estimation. This could impact the performance of the wireless communication system, as the missing AoA pairs may lead to incorrect beamforming and resource allocation decisions.\nFigure 6.3.3-3 Missing AoA pairs in the 2TRP scan\nAs evident from the observations in the figure, there are missing AoA test pairs (only one red segment attached to each grid point). Fortunately, for this scan, the omission of test AoA pairs is complementary across the two TRPs. In other words, if the locations of TRP1 and TRP2 are interchanged and the scan repeated (i.e complementary scan), the missing AoA pairs get tested and none of the previously tested AoA pairs gets re-tested. The combined data set from both scans has neither omitted AoA pairs, nor repeated pairs. The grid statistics as well as the impact of performing this complementary scan on the UE described earlier is shown in figure 6.3.3-4. Applying this improved scan to example UE completes the 2 TRP data set. The data set shows ‘improved’ statistics, but these are based merely on added AoA test directions from the complementary scan, rather than a genuine improvement at the UE.\n\nFigure 6.3.3-4 presents a complementary pair version of a 2TRP scan, illustrating the transmission and reception of signals through a telecommunication system. The figure showcases the use of two transmit-receive pairs (TRP) to capture both the forward and reverse paths of the signal, providing a comprehensive analysis of the system's performance. The two TRPs are depicted as separate lines, with the transmit and receive elements represented by the symbols T and R, respectively. The figure also includes a reference to a 2TRP scan, which is a technique used to measure the performance of a telecommunication system by analyzing the signal's path through the system. The figure is a valuable tool for engineers and technicians working in the field of telecommunication, as it provides a visual representation of the signal's path and helps to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement in the system.\nFigure 6.3.3-4: Complementary pair version of 2TRP scan\nBased on the analysis above, both +AoA offset and –AoA offset for each test point shall be considered in requirement evaluation. This arrangement is equivalent to the complementary scan technique.\n\n",

In theory, the test results with different UE orientations should be the same without considering the measurement grid uncertainty, because the 3D scan of 1AoA test is sampling UE’s sphere with test ‘point’. However, the 3D scan of 2AoA test is sampling UE’s sphere with test ‘vector’ corresponding to AoA pair. Different UE orientations will lead to different test ‘vector’ even at the same test point, and thus different 2AoA performance is expected.\nCompanies’ simulation results as provided in Annex A show that different UE orientations lead to significantly different 2AoA spherical coverage performance. Depending on different UE implementations, no standardized UE orientation could be found suitable for 2AoA performance test. RAN4 has agreed to specify the 2AoA spherical coverage performance in implementation agnostic manner, the most feasible way is to adopt the declaration approach.\nBased on the theoretical analysis and simulation results, RAN4 achieves following conclusion:\n1.\tUE requirement applies to UE declared orientation(s).\n2.\tThe UE RF requirement is derived assuming each UE is evaluated in the orientation that yields the best metric value.\n3.\tAll the candidate orientations discussed in this section for UE to choose from correspond to the ‘Alignment Options’ in Annex J (J.2) of TS 38.101-2.\n\n",

                            "text_content": "During investigation of projected UE performance with the legacy positioner, it became evident that different overall probabilities are calculated for the same UE, depending on its orientation in the positioner. See figure 6.3.5-3.\nFigure 6.3.5-1 illustrates the angle of arrival (AoA) pairs within the user equipment (UE) spherical reference coordinate system, with the agreed time-division duplex (TDD) technique. The figure depicts the longitudes along which the AoA pairs lie, highlighting the spatial diversity and signal processing capabilities of the system. The diagram emphasizes the importance of accurate angle measurements for beamforming and signal reception, showcasing the complex interplay between the UE, base stations, and antenna elements in a wireless communication network.The difference can be traced back to the agreed TE constraints that only tests the UE for AoA pairs that lie along longitudes in the reference coordinate system defined by positioner axes. See figure 6.3.5-1.\nFigure 6.3.5-1: AoA pairs lie along longitudes of the UE spherical reference coordinate system with the agreed TE.\nThis bias problem can be resolved by including AoA pairs that are not limited to the same longitude as is the case for the agreed TE, see figure 6.3.5-2.\nOne possibility is to average 2TRP performance data in the TE across multiple different orientations of the UE in the positioner. This method has been adopted successfully in the past for single TRP scenarios, but this method may not be suitable for 2TRP scenarios (where 2 directions are involved at one time):\n1. The primary problem is inability to include at each grid point, ‘AoA pairs that are not limited to the same longitude’. The legacy positioner does not retain the same grid for all orientation possibilities.\n2. A further problem is that even if the UE faces are pointing as desired, the actual module coverage directions may not be well centered around the respective face normals. Such UEs would face additional challenges with a procedure that introduces bias. At a minimum it would complicate the requirement derivation process.\nA better and more precise approach would be to diversify the collection of AoA pairs used to calculate regional probability at each grid point. This can be achieved by modify the agreed TE concept to use a 3-axis positioner rather than the legacy 2-axis positioner. Figure 6.3.5-2 shows the intended effect of the added degree of freedom from the UE’s perspective. Recall that the legacy 2-axis positioner in combination with a complementary sweep or +/-AoAsep scan is only able to pair each grid point to AoAs along the blue arrows, respectively. The 3-axis positioner is intended to allow each grid point to be additionally paired with AoAs along the green arrows.\nFigure 6.3.5-2 illustrates a scheme to mitigate bias in angle of arrival (AoA) measurements caused by the restriction of AoA pairs to lie along longitudes of agreed grid. The figure depicts a network with multiple antennas at different locations, each with a unique AoA. The proposed scheme involves adjusting the signal strength based on the AoA, ensuring that the bias is minimized. The figure also shows how the signal strength is adjusted based on the distance from the antenna, with a higher signal strength for closer distances. This approach helps to ensure accurate AoA measurements, which are crucial for accurate positioning and navigation systems.\nFigure 6.3.5-2: Scheme to combat bias introduced by AoA pairs limited to lie along longitudes of agreed grid.\nReferring to the mathematical formulation of overall probability, for the 3-axis positioner, the regional probability at each grid point can be determined from outcomes of a configurable number of AoA pairs that are spatially well distributed (6 shown) rather than just the two pairs that lie along the longitude associated with the grid point. The overall probability can be calculated from the regional probabilities over the sphere. The mathematical formulation also highlights the dissociation of the grid points where the regional probabilities are calculated from the locations of the paired AoAs for each grid point. Since multiple runs are no longer required to generate multiple AoA pairs at each point, the 2TRP scan can be simplified for the 3-axis positioner by dropping the requirement for enhancements such as the complementary pair sweep or combining data from +AoAsep and -AoAsep scans.\nFigures 6.3.5-3 shows the impact on calculated overall probability to support 2TRP DL of using a 3-axis positioner as described above to reduce bias for an example UE. The performance projections use a 5-degree step size and 6 AoA pairs per grid point (i.e. 6 stops for the roll motor at each grid point). Also assumed is a scan strategy that ensures neither source is blocked. It is evident that the projected performance trends are largely robust to UE orientation in the 3-axis positioner. Note however that due to non-zero size of any positioning mechanism, some declaration must be instituted so the UE is not oriented in way that it is partially blocked by the mechanism. Fortunately, this ‘UE alignment option’ is already established and recorded in TR38.810, Annex C, and can be retained for this feature.\nFigure 6.3.5-3 illustrates the process of bias removal using a 3-axis positioner in a telecommunication system. The figure depicts a device with three axes, each controlled by a separate knob, which allows for precise adjustment of the system's alignment. The goal is to align the device with the desired signal path, minimizing any unwanted signal distortions or biases. The figure demonstrates the importance of precise alignment in maintaining signal quality and ensuring optimal performance in the telecommunication system.\nFigure 6.3.5-3: Bias removal using a 3-axis positioner.\nDue to pragmatic considerations, this positioner enhancement is not pursued for this WI.\n",

                            "text_content": "There are four different DL polarization combinations, i.e., (TRP1q, TRP2q), (TRP1f, TRP2q), (TRP1q, TRP2f) or (TRP1f, TRP2f). It is known that the UE performance can differ if the same polarization or orthogonal polarization is adopted by the two probes in testing. With the same polarization, a higher correlation between the two DL data streams can be expected, especially when the AoA offset is small, representing the worst-case performance.\nIn deciding which combination to use for verification, there are two main considerations. First, the requirements should be derived based on the worst-case polarization match at the UE, and should apply for any combination of DL polarizations from each TRP. Second, there is a need to minimize the testing overhead while ensuring good testing coverage.\nIn the two-AoA simulations, the worst-case polarization match between the 2 TRPs is assumed. In other words, the transmitted signal from one TRP is considered interference without any polarization isolation at the UE when decoding the transmitted signal from the other TRP.\nIt was also pointed out that the radiation pattern of V-pol and H-pol of an antenna module is not exactly same, and when metal blockage exist, the difference may be amplified due to the reflection as shown in the Figure below. In practical UE design, to avoid severe blockage, the metal frame near the antenna module can be removed and replaced by other materials, but the V/H element may still suffer from different loss, which still lead to difference between V-pol and H-pol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3.6-1The radiation pattern of a pair of V/H element in 1x4 antenna module\nIf the gain difference exists between V-pol and H-pol, for each receiver branch, the projection from  and  should be calculated, and the following procedure to calculate received signal can be used:\nStep-1: Extract the antenna gain in θ direction and φ direction in module reference system when only V-elements are activated, i.e., GV,M (M, M) and GV,M (M, M)\nStep-2: Extract the antenna gain in θ direction and φ direction in module reference system when only H-elements are activated, i.e., GH,M (M, M) and GH,M (M, M)\n\n\nFigure 6.3.6-2 illustration of antenna gain in θ direction and φ direction\nStep-3: For the DL signal from each TRP in the TE coordinate system, transform the TRP location into the module reference system, e.g., for antenna module#1, AoA1(1, 1)AoA1(1M#1, 1M#1), AoA2(2, 2)  AoA1(2M#1, 2M#1) and for antenna module#2, AoA1(1, 1) AoA1(1M#2, 1M#2), AoA2(2, 2)  AoA1(2M#2, 2M#2)\n\n\nFigure 6.3.6-3 illustration of coordinate system transformation\nStep-4: The received signal for each antenna module (after MRC of rank1 DL) can be calculated when DL signal polarization is (θ,θ), e.g., the received signal from AoA1 by antenna module#1 is:\n\nThe received signal from AoA1 by antenna module#2 is:\n\n\nStep-5: The received signal for each antenna module (after MRC of rank1 DL) can be calculated when DL signal polarization is (φ, φ), e.g., the received signal from AoA1 by antenna module#1 is:\n\nThe received signal from AoA1 by antenna module#2 is:\n\n\nThe whole formula is shown in Table below:\n\nTable 6.3.6-1 The formula for received signal\n\n\n(*For simplicity, the DL signal in formula is normalized to 1)\nThe method above is a simplified one compared to the realistic MRC implementation at UE receiver, in figure 6.3.6-4, a simulation is performed to compare UE performance projections using the method above against a more realistic LMMSE type demodulation for two orientations of the UE. The UE model is a ‘4-component type’ described in Table 6.3.6-1. The MMSE solver assumed RSRP-based beam selection and a noise covariance matrix that depends on both, the uncorrelated thermal noise of the receiver and the correlated noise from the interferer. Channel estimation is genie type based on knowledge 4 component antenna gains and AWGN assumption.\n\n\nFigure 6.3.6-4 compares the performance of a User Equipment (UE) in terms of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) estimation between two different methods: LMMSE and RAN4 simplified. The figure illustrates the difference in SINR values for different UE locations, with the x-axis representing the distance from the base station (BS) and the y-axis representing the SINR value. The LMMSE method is depicted by the solid line, while the RAN4 simplified method is represented by the dashed line. The figure shows that the LMMSE method generally provides a higher SINR value across all UE locations compared to the RAN4 simplified method, indicating better performance in terms of signal quality. This comparison is important for network operators to understand the impact of different estimation methods on UE performance and to make informed decisions on network optimization.\nFigure 6.3.6-4: UE performance difference between LMMSE vs RAN4 simplified SINR estimation\nSome observations are listed below:\n1.\tFor UEs with modules on opposite faces, there is not much difference between the simplified RAN4 SINR method and the LMMSE-based method. The similarity is expected since this type of UE does not have significant overlap of coverage areas, so SINR tends to be noise limited.\n2.\tFor UEs with modules on adjacent faces, there can be significant overlap in coverage. Some AoA pairs (specifically those with lower AoA offsets) are interference limited. For these scenarios, MMSE can help significantly because of polarization mismatch in the general case between the 2 rank1 DLs.\n3.\tThe characteristic of the MMSE based receiver to help in interference limited cases becomes clear for a UE with modules on the same face. This type of UE has a lot of spatial overlap and therefore strong interference for low AoA offsets. The MMSE based received performs better than the RAN4 SINR calculation estimate for narrow AoA offsets where interference limited cases become more dominant.\nTo further investigate how the gain imbalance will impact on the UE performance under the method above, Figure 6.3.6-5 show the overall probability performance gap between  DL and  DL, and three implementations are considered: Implementation#1 is 2 panels in the same side, Implementation#1 is 2 panels in the adjacent side, Implementation#3 is 2 panels in the opposite side. The X dB additional gain difference is added to V pattern and H pattern separately, 1.e., +X/2 dB to V pattern and -X/2 dB to H pattern. Both the results of OR combing and arithmetic mean are provided.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3.6-5 Performance gap between  DL and  DL\nThe results show that when gain difference increase, the performance gap is not always enlarged since the gain difference will affect the received signal in both V branch and H branch and how the performance gap changes depending on panels location, AoA offset, etc. To reduce the performance gap between different polarization of DL polarization, one possible way is to construct final results by averaging the performance between  DL and  DL. Figure 6.3.6-6 shows that how the gain difference impact on the results after average.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3.6-6 Overall probability under different gain imbalance after average\nCompared to the performance gap between different DL polarizations, the performance change under different additional gain difference is smaller after average. We can also find that there is no conclusive relationship between gain imbalance and UE performance.\nIn the end, the UE RF requirement is defined as the average (arithmetic mean) of the metric values for two DL polarization test conditions: the first condition is when the DL polarizations at both TRPs are ‘’ and the second condition is when they are ‘’.\n\nWhere ‘N%(.,.)’ is the metric value for the requirement for the DL pols specified in the subscripts.\n",

There are two options on how to specify the multi-RX spherical coverage requirement with respect to NTC vs. ETC:\n-\tOption 1: Keep core requirement wording for the multi-RX spherical coverage requirement consistent with that of the legacy requirement, i.e., with a similar note as NOTE 2 in 38.101-2 Table 7.3.4.3-1, i.e., “The EIS spherical coverage requirements are verified only under normal thermal conditions as defined in Annex E.2.1.”\n-\tOption 2: Do not use the note in the multi-RX spherical coverage requirement, and RAN4 agrees the requirement shall be verified under NTC only. Also, RAN4 ask RAN5 to verify it for NTC only.\nThe argument for Option 2 is usually RAN4 core requirements are specified independent of the verification conditions and such a convention should be preserved. The way the legacy requirement is specified is considered an exception, and there is a desire to avoid such exceptions. Furthermore, RAN4 has agreed to ask RAN5 to verify the requirement only under NTC. In this way, the RAN4 convention is kept, and no additional work is required to derive the appropriate core requirement for ETC.\nIn the end, Option 2 is agreed upon.\n",

The conclusion is that UE can access to TRP pairs only if the channel conditions are good enough, and there are no obvious preferred AoA separation. For simplicity while taking into account the constraints of the test system, 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 150° are agreed as the candidate AoA separations for requirement design.\nHow many AoA separations are needed to meet the requirement at the same time is the first problem to be solved. A popular option is to verify at least two AoA separations, one from [30°, 60°, 90°] and another one from [120°, 150°], and the intention is to get a full picture of UE performance.\nAs the simulation results shown in Annex A.8, when AoA separation changes, different UE implementation will show different trends, e.g., For the case that panels in opposite side, UE performance become better when the AoA separation is larger, but when panels in same side, UE performance will be worse with the increase of AoA separation. Due to the different trends, if two different AoA separations need to meet the requirements simultaneously, to accommodate different UE implementation, the requirement for each AoA separation will always be gated by the implementation that has the worst performance. To avoid such restriction, RAN4 agree that only 1AoA separation from all candidates need to be verified.\nAnother problem is that which AoA separation should be selected from the candidates and two options are raised during the discussion. One is to only specify one AoA separation in the specification, e.g., 90°, and with this approach, the worst performance across different placement of antenna modules should be used as requirement to accommodate different implementations. Another approach is to allow UE to declare its preferred AoA separation and the requirement for each AoA separation from candidates needs to be introduced in specification. Using this approach, the requirement will be linked to the UE implementation to show the best performance that one UE may achieved while avoiding put unnecessary restriction on UE implementation. The rules to construct the requirement is agreed as below:\n-\tThree types of reference UE implementation (two panels on the same side, two panels on the adjacent side and two panels on the opposite side) will be used to determine the core requirement:\nIf the AoA offset would be declared by UE\n\n\n\n\nIf the AoA offset would be specified in the standard.\n\nTo better show UE performance under this feature, RAN4 agreed that the AoA separation to be verified can be declared by UE.\n",

                    "text_content": "Background\nAs the RF requirement serves as a metric for UE’s two-AoA spherical coverage performanceSince the AoA offset is varied in the real network, it is helpful to know how the AoA offset between two AoAs is distributed in real network in different scenarios, which can provide guidance on whether the range of AoA offset can be narrowed down and the requirement can be targeted for some common AoA offsets.\nR4-2218166\nTo understand if the angular difference between the two AoAs observed in a typical multi-TRP deployment scenario exhibits any pattern, we conduct simulation based on the system simulation assumptions in A.2 in TR 38.802. We simulate the following mTRP scenario as shown below. In particular, the inter-macro TRP distance is 200m, in each cell (hexagon), three micro TRPs are randomly dropped within each dashed circle (i.e., cluster) around the center of the circle (within 20m), following some minimum distance rules (such as the minimum distance between two micro TRPs is 40m, the minimum distance between a micro TRP to a macro TRP is 10m, etc.). UEs are randomly dropped in the cluster (R = 50m). UE is assumed to have two back-to-back panels (pointing to opposite directions), with 4x1 antenna elements each.Details of other simulation parameters such as power can be found in Table A.2.1-1 in TR 38.802 corresponding to the Dense urban scenario.\n\n\nThe analysis methodology for these simulations is as follows:\n1.\tAssume each site (macro & micro TRP), in the modeled network is a potential point for the mTRP connection\n2.\tCalculate RSRP between each site, taking into account BS gain in the link direction, UE gain in the link direction, and path loss\n3.\tAssociate TRP1 and TRP2 according to max. RSRP and also according to one of the following panel mapping assumptions:\n-\tNo restriction on panel mapping (i.e., two beams with best RSRP can be mapped to the same panel)\nOR\n-\tBest panel mapping (i.e., one AoA is mapped to the best beam/panel, and the other AoA is mapped to the best beam from the remaining panel)\n4.\tCalculate AoA1 and AoA2 to these TRPs from the UE perspective\n5.\tEvaluate the distribution of AoA1 - AoA2 (∆AoA)\nResults are shown in Figures 1 and 2 below.\n-\tIt can be seen from Fig. A.2-1 that with unrestricted panel mapping, the distribution of ∆AoA is nearly uniform. In -other words, it takes values from 0 to 180 degrees with equal probability.\n-\tIn Fig. A.2-2, with best panel mapping restriction, it can be observed that for 95% of the UEs, ∆AoA > 60 degrees.\n-\tWe note the results depend in general on the UE antenna panel assumptions as well as the power levels of the macro and micro nodes. We welcome other companies to share results for comparison.\nFigure A.2 -1 illustrates the distribution of ∆AoA with unrestricted panel mapping, showcasing the variation in angle of arrival for different locations within a given area. The figure presents a heat map, with darker shades indicating higher values of ∆AoA. Key elements include the transmitter (Tx), receiver (Rx), and the surrounding environment, which consists of buildings and other obstacles. The data points are color-coded to represent the magnitude of ∆AoA, providing insights into the spatial distribution of the signal and its impact on communication performance.\nFigure A.2-1: Distribution of ∆AoA with unrestricted panel mapping\nFigure A.2 illustrates the distribution of ∆AoA with the best panel mapping restriction, showcasing how the angle of arrival (∆AoA) is distributed across different panels. The figure highlights the importance of accurate panel mapping in determining the optimal beamforming vectors for improved signal reception. The visual representation emphasizes the correlation between the angle of arrival and the corresponding beamforming vectors, which are crucial for enhancing signal quality and reducing interference.\nFigure A.2-2: Distribution of ∆AoA with best panel mapping restriction\nR4-2301573\nTo further figure out the AoA separation distribution in the dedicated deployment, we perform a simulation and 2 deployments are considered, as shown in Figure A.2-3:\nFigure A.2 illustrates the indoor and dense urban (macro only) deployment of a telecommunication network, showcasing the infrastructure required for coverage in such environments. The figure depicts the use of small cells and macro base stations to ensure adequate signal strength and coverage in densely populated areas. The indoor units (IDU) and outdoor units (ODU) are shown, highlighting the different components that make up the network. The figure also highlights the importance of efficient planning and placement of these units to optimize network performance and capacity.

For Dense Urban, the TRPs with the same color can collaborate. Other simulation assumptions are mainly from TR38.802, and the results are shown in Figure A.2-4.\nFigure A.2 illustrates the distribution of Angle of Arrival (AoA) separation in both indoor and dense urban environments. The figure shows the frequency separation between adjacent users, with a focus on the 2.4 GHz band. The data points represent the average AoA separation for different user densities, providing insights into the potential interference and channel capacity in various scenarios.

                    "text_content": "Background\nIt is preferrable to define a single set of requirements for both sDCI and mDCI, and the following part provides the analysis of whether it is feasible under functionality-based requirement.\nR4-2308232\nWhen both AoAs use the same fixed DL power level, due to the antenna gain and inter-beam interference being different for the signal from 2 AoA, the SINR at baseband for 2 layers are different, which means using the same fixed DL power will bring power imbalance artificially.\nFor multi-DCI UE, each layer can be decoded separately and we can get the throughput of each layer, so the power imbalance doesn’t matter and the -1 dB criterion above to judge each test point from a pair of AoA is still reasonable. However, things become different for sDCI UE because the 2 layers of sDCI UE share one transmission block and we can only get a total throughput of 2-layer MIMO, and there is no doubt that the power imbalance will affect this total throughput, and simply using -1dB as the criterion for each test point does not make sense anymore. Figure A.3-1 shows that how power imbalance will affect the throughput of sDCI UE.\nFigure A.3 illustrates the impact of power imbalance for sDCI UE, showcasing the varying signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) experienced by different user equipment (UE) in a shared-data-channel-initiative (sDCI) network. The figure highlights the sensitivity of sDCI to power imbalances, with higher SINR values indicating better communication quality. Key components include the base station (gNB), user equipment (UE), and the shared data channel (sDCI). The diagram emphasizes the importance of power optimization and interference management in sDCI networks to ensure reliable and efficient communication.\nFigure A.3-1 impact of power imbalance for sDCI UE\n\nIn the simulation, the SINR1 and SINR2 represent the SINR value from 2AoA. Obviously, due to the power imbalance, even though one of SINRs is less than -1 dB, the total throughput still can achieve 95% RMC and pass the test.\nDoes raising or lowering the power of one of the AoA can help with this problem? The answer is NO. Simply changing the power level cannot remove the power imbalance, and the only way to solve this issue is for each test point, the DL power should be changed, but this scheme is too complicated from both the verification and evaluation perspectives.\nAs a compromise, we can only focus on that whether the sDCI UE can pass the same requirement as mDCI under power imbalance. In Figure A.3-1, the simulation shows that when both SINRs is larger than -1 dB, the total throughput still can be larger than 95% RMC, which means the -1 dB in simulation still can ensure the AoA pair can pass the test. The only omission here is that cases where either SINR1 or SINR2 is less than <-1 dB and UE can still pass the test are accounted for in the requirement. As we mention above, even though we realize this omission, it is hard to be verified or evaluated. So we think it is enough to confirm the same requirement can be applied to both sDCI and mDCI UEs under the current evaluation method.\n\n",

When metal blockage exists, the EM field will be scattered due to the reflection, and it is hard to summarize a rule between N% and AoA offset. The UE orientation also led to different results although the AoA offset is same, and the reason here is that the relative position between AoA pair and UE will be changed under different UE orientation.\n\nR4-2304603\nTo evaluate the impact of different choices on module orientations relative to the UE reference coordinate system, a UE with 2 identical modules housed in adjacent faces was used. Each module comprised a 4x1 dual polarized element array. The coverage pattern is shown in figure A.5-3. Annex C has details on the module orientation in the UE reference coordinate system. Module locations were grouped into two categories.\n-\tIn the first category, one module pattern covered the polar region of the reference coordinate system. Examples: Front+Bottom, Front+Top, Front+Right\n-\tIn the second category, both modules cover equatorial regions (away from polar regions). Examples: Top+Left, Top+Right\nFigure A. 5 -3 illustrates the coverage pattern of an example user equipment (UE) with modules on adjacent faces, showcasing how the signal strength varies across different locations. The figure depicts three distinct areas: a coverage area, an edge area, and an uncovered area. The coverage area represents the regions where the signal is strong enough for reliable communication, while the edge area indicates a decrease in signal strength. The uncovered area signifies the regions where the signal is too weak to establish a connection. The figure highlights the importance of optimizing the placement of modules on the device's surface to maximize signal strength and coverage.\nFigure A.5-3: Coverage pattern of example UE with modules on adjacent faces\nThe list in each category is not exhaustive but deemed sufficient to capture characteristic trends.\nFigures A.5-4 and A.5-5 shows a comparison of overall probability to support 2TRP DL for the example UE chosen for the UE positioning study. Category 1 orientations are captured in cool colors (blues and greens), and category 2 orientations are captured in warm colors (reds).\nHere too, the dashed and solid trends for any one color track closely. This suggests that module orientation (H-scanning or V-scanning) seems to make a relatively small difference in the projected overall probability result for a UE with modules on adjacent faces.\n\n",

(i.e cannot meet both REFSENS and spherical coverage gain drop at the same time.). In these cases, the baseline assumption in a previous WF suggests to ‘scale antenna gain’, see excerpt below (figure 2.4-1).\n\nThere are several ways to achieve this scaling: the first method would apply to both modules equally (symmetric scaling of gains in way to ‘tune’ the spherical coverage gain drop), and the second method would reduce the gain of one of the modules relative to the other (asymmetric scaling). Asymmetric scaling makes the sensitivity worse for one module over the other, so it can impact the probability metric significantly, see tables below.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that all the UEs above are calibrated to legacy spherical coverage, but the probability metrics can be vastly different between UEs with equal modules and UEs with asymmetric modules. This difference may be tolerable for small differences (2 dB or less) across modules, but this type of implementation is not suitable for 2 TRP reception if the asymmetric gain split is larger across the modules. Larger gain splits become necessary if the individual module\n",
