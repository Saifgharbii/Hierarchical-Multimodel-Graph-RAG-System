                            "text_content": "Satellite RAN can be comprised out of either LEO, MEO, GEO satellites or a combination of these three. LEO and MEO satellites do not have a fixed position relative to the earth and travel at high speed in trajectories around the earth. The possible satellite beam coverage area may therefore change in a continuous fashion, as can also be seen in Figure 5.3.1.1. This is also described in more detail in clause A.2.\nA LEO, MEO or GEO satellite can either be working in transparent mode or in regenerative mode. When a satellite is configured in transparent mode, no data processing will be done locally in the satellite. The incoming signal will be received, amplified, and transmitted back to earth. A regenerative satellite may actually demodulate/decode and process the incoming signal before sending data back to earth. A regenerative satellite may therefore embark a eNB/gNB/gNB-DU/gNB-CU and use inter satellite links to communicate with other satellite eNB/gNBs. A transparent satellite may be coupled to an eNB/gNB which is located on earth, this eNB/gNB will use a satellite gateway to transmit to the satellite which reflects the signal back to earth.\nIn case of MEO and LEO satellites with moving beams the cell coverage may not be fixed to a specific location on earth, and since the possible coverage area of a satellite may even span multiple countries, it would be possible that the neighbouring (terrestrial) cells of the satellite eNB/gNB will change continuously. This may result in continuous NCR reconfigurations and PCI conflicts and/or PCI confusion since the NTN cell coverage may overlap with terrestrial RAN. This effect is also described in clause 8.5.3 from TR 38.821 [9].\nThe given telecommunication figure illustrates the concept of time division duplex (TDD) in a wireless communication system. It depicts the signal propagation from the base station (BS) to the user equipment (UE) through the time-division duplex (TDD) process. The figure shows the signal being transmitted in the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) directions, with the uplink signal being received by the base station and the downlink signal being transmitted to the user equipment. The figure also includes a representation of the time-frequency division, which is a key aspect of TDD systems. The figure is a valuable resource for understanding the principles of TDD in wireless communication systems.\nNOTE: \tHere it is assumed that the TAC will be fixed on earth.\n\nFigure 5.3.1.1: Example of a MEO or LEO satellite flying over multiple geographical areas\nTo prevent these issues, it would be possible to use/extent the SON ANR and SON PCI re-configuration functions from TS 28.313 [10] and adapt these to support continuously moving cells. This way, the PCI re-configuration procedure may deconflict PCI's when an PCI conflict happens between an NTN cell and a terrestrial cell. The ANR could be used to automatically configure new neighbouring cells when the NTN cell coverage moves over the earth atmosphere. The SON ANR and SON PCI functions should be fast enough to keep up with the moving satellites which may have new neighbouring cells every 5 - 30 seconds.\nIn case of GEO satellites or MEO and LEO satellites with earth fixed beams, there is no need to adapt the SON ANR and SON PCI re-configuration functions since the coverage area of the satellite RAN will be fixed to a geographical area on earth's surface.\nNTN MEO/LEO satellite or satellite constellation that provides discontinuous coverage is considered as the satellite access in 5GS and EPS. Satellite assistance information (e.g. ephemeris information), can be used for the handling of coverage holes or discontinuous satellite coverage in a power efficient way. For a UE, it should be possible to predict discontinuous coverage based on the satellite assistance information.\nThe 3GPP management system should provide the following IoT-NTN satellite ephemeris parameters to the eNB providing non-terrestrial access as outlined in TS 38.300 [3], which the NR NTN agreements can be used as the baseline.\nThis solution uses the instances of following IOCs or attributes representing the Ephemeris information, for example, named as ephemerisInformation, and it contains the following attributes:\n-\tEphemeris information describing the orbital trajectory information or coordinates for the NTN vehicles. This information is provided on a regular basis or upon demand to the eNB/gNB;\n-\tTwo different sets of ephemeris formats are supported:\n- \t Set 1: Satellite position and velocity state vectors:\n- \tPosition;\n-\tVelocity.\n- \tSet 2: At least the following parameters in orbital parameter ephemeris format:\n- \tSemi-major axis;\n- \t Eccentricity;\n- \tArgument of periapsis;\n- \tLongitude of ascending node;\n-\tInclination;\n- \tMean anomaly at epoch time to.\n- \tThe explicit epoch time associated to ephemeris data;\n- \tThe location of the NTN-Gateways;\nNOTE: \tThe name of the IOCs and attributes are to be decided in the normative phase.\nBesides satellite ephemeris data, 3GPP management system can provide satellite coverage availability information to. The satellite coverage availability information provisioned to the AMF describes when and where satellite coverage is expected to be available in an area. The satellite coverage availability information is not UE specific and can be applied by the AMF for any UE in the affected area.\nThis solution uses the instances of following IOCs or attributes representing satellite coverage availability information to provide when and where satellite coverage is expected to be available in an area, , for example named as coverageInformation, and it contains the following attributes:\n- \tWait range, which is the location information and is based on network configuration (e.g. TA list);\n- \texpected coverage available time, which indicates the timing information related to expected coverage availability of satellite/satellite constellation.\n",

This effect requires changes to the HARQ process, so that it is able to cope with these high latencies. In TR 38.821 [9] it is proposed to optimise the HARQ process for MEO and GEO satellites by increasing the number of HARQ processes and to add an option to disable or enable HARQ feedback for the cases when the increased number of HARQ processes is still not sufficient.\nThe Average delay DL air-interface measurement (clause 5.1.1.1.1 of TS 28.552 [11]) and Distribution of delay DL air-interface measurement (clause 5.1.1.1.2 of TS 28.552 [11]) use the HARQ feedback ACK message to verify that the transmitted and timed RLC SDU packet was received successfully by the NB-IoT/eMTC UE.

            "description": "On the one hand, our planet attracts as a main body the much smaller satellite, which motion is dictated as a consequence by the laws of Kepler. On the other hand, the environment of Earth can be also constraining: the higher density of the atmosphere, debris from launchers and former satellites in the lower altitudes, as well as higher energy particles trapped in the Van Allen belts between 2,000 and 8,000 km's altitudes are to be avoided. These two constraints contribute to defining several classes of orbits that are used for communication satellites:\n-\tGeostationary (GEO) satellites, located precisely in the plane of the Equator at an altitude of 35,786 km, these satellites rotate at the same rate as the Earth's rotation: a GEO satellite stands still with respect to Earth. Thanks to this property, a single GEO satellite is sufficient to create a continuous coverage.\n-\tNon-Geostationary Orbiting (NGSO) satellites: NGSO satellites do not stand still with respect to Earth. Should service continuity be required over time, a number of satellites (a constellation) is required to meet this requirement; the lower the altitude the higher the number of satellites.\nDifferent classes of NGSO satellites are listed below:\n-\tLow-Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites, with altitude ranging from 500 km to 2,000 km, and with inclination angle of the orbital plane ranging from 0 to more than 90 degrees. These constellations are placed above the International Space Station and debris, and below the first Van Allen belt.\n-\tMedium-Earth Orbiting (MEO) satellites, with altitude ranging from 8,000 to 20,000 km. The inclination angle of the orbital plane ranges from 0 to more than 90 degrees. These constellations are placed above the Van Allen belts.\n-\tHighly-Eccentric Orbiting (HEO) satellites, with a range of operational altitudes (the orbit of such satellites being designed for the spacecraft to be exploited when the vehicle is closer to its apogee - the higher part of the orbit -) between 7,000 km and more than 45,000 km. The inclination angle is selected so as to compensate, completely or partially, the relative motion of Earth with respect to the orbital plane, allowing the satellite to cover successively different parts of Northern land masses (e.g. Western Europe, North America, and Northern Asia).\nFigure A.2-1 illustrates the various classes of orbits for satellites, showcasing the different paths and altitudes at which they operate. The diagram categorizes orbits based on their inclination and eccentricity, providing a comprehensive overview of the orbital mechanics that govern satellite communication and positioning. Key visual elements include the plane of the Earth's equator, the orbital plane, and the orbital elements such as the semi-major axis, eccentricity, and inclination. The figure emphasizes the strategic placement of satellites to maximize coverage and minimize latency, highlighting the complex dynamics of satellite networks.\nFigure A.2-1: Illustration of the classes of orbits of satellites\n\n",
