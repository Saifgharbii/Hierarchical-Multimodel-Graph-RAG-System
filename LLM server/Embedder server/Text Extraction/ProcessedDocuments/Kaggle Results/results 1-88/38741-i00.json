            "description": "3GPP RAN#86 meeting approved the Rel-17 WI that aimed to enable support of the 5G/NR radio access technology for non-terrestrial satellite deployments. One of the WI objectives was to define and introduce the corresponding bands into the 3GPP specifications. The outcome of these discussions was two NTN bands – L-band and S-band – which were added as bands n255 and n256, respectively. At the same time there exist other satellite deployments, some of which use mixed L-/S-band pairing, whereupon the UL part is on the L-band, while the DL part is on the S-band. To limit the overall workload in Rel-17, it was decided by RAN WG4 to focus on L- and S-bands with the common understanding that other potential NTN bands should follow the \"normal\" process of submitting a new spectrum WI.\n3GPP RAN#98 meeting agreed a new spectrum WI to add support for a new NTN band with the DL part on the S-band (2500MHz) and the UL part on the L-band (1600MHz).\n",

Results are the same for both FCC and ETSI requirements because the main limiting factor is the out-of-band emission requirements, which are the same for both regulatory domains. In other words, even though ETSI has additional in-band emission requirements for 1610-1618MHz, they do not impact results. 6.2.1.2.2.4-1 illustrates power spectrum of the fully allocated 5MHz channel right at the lower edge of the band showing that unless power back-off is applied out of band emission requirements will be violated.\n-\tAs somewhat anticipated, RBs scheduled at the centre of the NR channel do not require any power back-off; but RBs scheduled at the leftmost edge of the configured NR channel do require power back-off to meet out-of-band emission requirements. Similarly, power back-off is needed when all RBs are scheduled to mitigate emissions coming from the full-channel transmissions.\n-\tIn case of the 5MHz channel, once the channel is shifted farther from the left edge of the band where the GNSS services are, the required power back-off goes down a lot and is caused mostly by the in-band emission requirements. For instance, if the 5MHz NR channel is shifted by 1.4MHz from the lower edge, then small RB allocations will not require any power back-off at all. Some of the channel edge allocations might need power back-off, but it does not exceed baseline MPR. For both FCC and ETSI regulations the switching point is around the center frequency of 1615.7MHz, after which power back-off values remain limited to the basic MPR requirements for any configuration case.\n-\tThe 5MHz channel placed at the rightmost edge of the band may need some A-MPR for the RBs scheduled at the right edge of the channel under the ETSI regulations because the latter have out-of-band emission requirements for higher frequencies. 6.2.1.2.2.4-2 shows the power spectrum plot for the right-most channel, from which one can see that unless a UE applies power back-off the ETSI out-of-band emission requirements can be violated. Nevertheless, once the channel is shifted away from the upper edge by 1.6MHz, no A-MPR is needed at least for small allocations. And under the FCC regulations no A-MPR is needed even for the right-most channel because there are no out-of-band emission requirements for higher frequencies.\n-\tAs for the 10 and 15MHz channels, even if we shift the channel to the right from the leftmost band edge, some configuration cases would still require A-MPR irrespective of whether it is ETSI or FCC requirements. As in cases for other channels at the band edge, A-MPR is needed mostly for the case when all RBs are scheduled. The only difference between FCC and ETSI power back-off values is that FCC will trigger lower A-MPR because there are no out-of-band emission requirements for upper frequencies and no in-band emission requirements.\n\nFigure 6.2.1.2.2.4 - 1 presents a power spectrum plot for a CP-OFDM transmission with a fully allocated 5MHz bandwidth, centered at 1612.5MHz. The plot illustrates the spectral distribution of the transmitted signal, revealing the presence of multiple subcarriers within the allocated frequency range. The spectrum is characterized by a series of peaks and troughs, indicating the presence of different frequency components. The peaks represent the strongest signals, while the troughs indicate weaker signals. The plot is essential for analyzing the performance of the CP-OFDM system and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.\nFigure 6.2.1.2.2.4-1: Power spectrum plot for the CP-OFDM 5MHz fully allocated transmission (Fc=1612.5MHz).\n\nFigure 6.2.1.2.2.4 - 2 presents a power spectrum plot for a CP-OFDM transmission with fully allocated bandwidth, where the center frequency (Fc) is set at 16 MHz. The plot illustrates the distribution of power across different frequency components, providing insights into the spectral efficiency of the transmission. The visual representation of the power spectrum highlights the efficient use of the allocated bandwidth, ensuring minimal interference and maximizing data throughput.\nFigure 6.2.1.2.2.4-2: Power spectrum plot for the CP-OFDM 5MHz fully allocated transmission (Fc=1624MHz MHz).\n\nIf an operator decides to ensure lower power back-off, then one of the possible approaches is to rely upon 5MHz channels and to configure them with offsets from the lower/upper band edges. Then to avoid wasting 1.4/1.6MHz at the edges of the band it is possible to deploy other technologies, such as LTE CatM and NB-IOT. Figure 6.2.1.2.2.4-3 shows an exemplary allocation of channels, where an operator may consider one LTE CatM channel or seven NB-IOT channels at the lower edge of the band. For the upper edge, either eight NB-IOT channels can be configured, or one LTE CatM channel can be combined with one NB-IOT channel.\nFigure 6.2.1.2.2.4 - 3 presents an illustrative example of channel allocations at the extremities of the frequency spectrum.

Since FCC does not introduce any special in-band emission requirements for sub-ranges, same requirements will be applicable for the whole range and for all the channel sizes.\nb)\tETSI regulations have different in-band emission masks depending on the operating sub-range, so two NS flags are needed to differentiate between them.\nc)\tNS_04N applicable range is limited to 1610-1618.25MHz according to the ETSI requirements. And since the total spectrum block size is 8.25MHz, it can accommodate only 5MHz standard NR channel, i.e. the applicable NR channel size is 5MHz.\nd)\tNS_04N is for the ETSI range 1618.25-1626.5MHz, which can also accommodate only 5MHz standard NR channel. However, ETSI document also clarifies that the same in-band emission requirements will apply if the channel is partially configured in that range. It means that any 10 and 15MHz channel configured in 1610-1626.5MHz range will inevitably fall into the 1618.25-1626.5MHz range and thus they will follow NS_04N requirements.\nTable 6.2.1.3-1: NTN L-/S-band NS values\n\nMapping between values of additionalSpectrumEmission and NS values is given in the Table 6.2.3.1-2 below.\nTable 6.2.1.3-2: Mapping of network signalling label\n\nFor the 5MHz channel, Figure 6.2.1.3a-1 below presents a graphical summary of the required power back-off values for different 5MHz channels:\n-\tThe 5MHz channel right at the lower edge of the band requires power back-off even for small RB allocations irrespective of the fact whether it is FCC or ETSI regulations. If the channel is shifted by 1.4MHz, then at least small RB allocations will not require power back-off exceeding baseline MPR requirements. Shifting the 5MHz channel beyond the 1615.7MHz centre frequency results in no A-MPR at all.\n-\tAs for the upper edge of the band, the 5MHz channel under the FCC regulations will not require any additional A-MPR requirements even if it is right at the edge because there are no out-of-band emission requirements for the upper frequencies. However, with the ETSI regulations we will need to provide offset of 1.6MHz, upon which we will not be exceeding baseline MPR requirements.\n-\tBecause of the same regulations for the lower frequencies, A-MPR values can be the same for NS_03N (FCC) and NS_04N (ETSI lower range) at centre frequencies 1612.5 <= fc < 1615.7MHz. Furthermore, it is possible to split A-MPR values into two regions – 1612.5 <= fc < 1613.9MHz and 1613.9 <= fc < 1615.7MHz – whereupon the second region will not require A-MPR for small RB allocations.\n-\tThere is no need for A-MPR for NS_03N (FCC) at centre frequencies above 1615.7MHz, but NS_05N (ETSI upper range) requires A-MPR for center frequencies at 1622.4 < fc <= 1624MHz.\n\n\nFigure 6.2.1.3a - 1 presents a summary of the required power back-off regions for the 5MHz channel, as mandated by both the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). The top portion of the figure illustrates the power back-off regions under FCC regulations, while the bottom portion represents the regions under ETSI guidelines. The figure is a visual representation of the necessary distance between base stations to ensure compliance with the specified regulations, which are crucial for maintaining efficient and safe communication networks.\nFigure 6.2.1.3a-1: Summary of required power back-off regions for the 5MHz channel for FCC (top) and ETSI (bottom) regulations.\nFor the 10MHz channel:\n-\tFor the channel right at the lower edge of the band, A-MPR might be needed even for small RB allocations at the channel edges because of the strict out-of-band emission requirements. Shifting the channel farther away from the lower edge basically improves A-MPR with the switching point at the centre frequency of around 1620.1MHz (i.e. 1.4MHz offset from the upper edge), after which at least for the ETSI requirements emission requirements from the upper frequencies start influencing allocations at the channel’s upper edge. Based on that A-MPR values can be considered the same for NS_03N (FCC) and NS_05N (ETSI) for the centre frequencies at 1615 <= fc < 1620.1MHz.\n-\tFor the channel right at the upper edge of the band, A-MPR is generally not needed for small allocations under the FCC regulations, which is reflected in the corresponding A-MPR for NS_03 for the channel at 1621.5MHz. However, with NS_05N (ETSI) A-MPR is still required because of the out-of-band emission requirements for upper frequencies.\n-\tAs can be seen from Figure 6.2.1.3a-2 below, the only major difference between the FCC and ETSI A-MPR regions is that the former can have optimised 10MHz channel placed right at the upper edge of the band.\n\n\nFigure 6.2.1.3a - 2 presents a summary of the required power back-off regions for the 10MHz channel, as mandated by both the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).

The figure is a visual representation of the necessary distance between base stations to ensure compliance with regulations and avoid interference.
