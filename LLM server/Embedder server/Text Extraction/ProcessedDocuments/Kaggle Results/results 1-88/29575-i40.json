The figure depicts the interaction between the service consumer and the network function as a request is made to store data or perform analytics. The network function, represented by the box in the center, processes the request and communicates with other network functions and storage systems as needed. The figure highlights the importance of network functions in enabling advanced services and the need for efficient communication between different components of the network.\nFigure 4.2.2.2.2-1: NF service consumer requesting to store data or analytics\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Nadrf_DataManagement_StorageRequest service operation to store data or analytics. The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/nadrf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/data-store-records\" as Resource URI representing the \"ADRF Data Store Records\" resource, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.2-1, step 1, to create an \"Individual ADRF Data Store Record\" according to the information in the message body. The NadrfDataStoreRecord data structure provided in the request body shall include:\n-\tone of the following:\n-\tanalytics subscription notification(s) within the \"anaNotifications\" attribute together with the corresponding subscription information within the \"anaSub\" attribute;\n-\tdata subscription notification within the \"dataNotif\" attribute together with the corresponding subscription information within the \" dataSub\" attribute.\nand may include:\n-\tstorage handling information within the \"storeHandl\" attribute, if the \"EnhDataMgmt\" feature is supported.\n-\ta data set tag within the \"dataSetTag\" attribute, if the \"EnhDataMgmt\" feature is supported;\n-\tdata synthesis and compression information within the \"dsc\" attribute, if the \"EnhDataMgmt\" feature is supported.\nNOTE:\tThe data synthesis and compression information can include an indication that the data have been generated using a data synthesis tool, an indication that the data have been generated using a data compression tool, and information about the data synthesis and/or compression technique.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/nadrf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/data-store-records\" as Resource URI and NadrfDataStoreRecord data structure as request body, the ADRF shall:\n-\tcreate a new data store record;\n-\tassign a storeTransId;\n-\tstore the data or analytics.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the data and/or analytics is already stored or being stored in the ADRF, the ADRF will still create a new \"Individual ADRF Data Store Record\" resource and assign a new storeTransId if the ADRF intends to not really store the data again in the memory again based on the implementation.\nIf the ADRF created an \"Individual ADRF Data Store Record\" resource, the ADRF shall respond with \"201 Created\" with the message body containing a representation of the created record, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.2-1, step 2. The ADRF shall include a Location HTTP header field. The Location header field shall contain the URI of the created record i.e. \"{apiRoot}/nadrf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/data-store-records/{storeTransId}\".\nIf the ADRF receives storage handling information in the request but determines (e.g. based on local policy) that a different storage approach shall be followed, it indicates the determined storage approach to the consumer by setting accordingly the \"storeHandl\" attribute (e.g. providing a different lifetime, or omitting the deletion notification URI to indicate that no deletion alerts will be sent) in the message body of the response. When more than one consumer has requested storage lifetime for the same data or analytics, the storage approach should be based on the longest requested storage lifetime.\nNOTE 2:\tThe default operator policy for how long data or analytics are to be stored can be longer or shorter than the lifetime requested by the consumer. A default operator policy can for example accept only consumer requested lifetimes that are shorter or longer than the default policy.\nIf an error occurs when processing the HTTP POST request, the ADRF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.\nThe Nadrf_DataManagement_StorageSubscriptionRequest service operation is used by an NF service consumer to request that the ADRF creates a subscription to data or analytics and subsequently stores notified data or analytics in the ADRF.\nFigure 4.2.2.3.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a request to the ADRF to subscribe for data or analytics to be stored in the ADRF.\nFigure 4.2.2.3.2-1 illustrates the process of a Network Function Service (NF Service) consumer requesting that the Access and Routing Function (ARF) subscribes to and subsequently stores data or analytics. The figure depicts the interaction between the NF Service consumer, the ARF, and the Network Function Repository (NFR). The NF Service consumer initiates the process by sending a request to the NFR, which then communicates with the ARF to subscribe to the desired NF service. The ARF processes the request and stores the necessary data or analytics, enabling the NF Service consumer to access the information as needed. This process is crucial for enabling efficient and dynamic network functions, as it allows for quick and easy updates and modifications to network services.\nFigure 4.2.2.3.2-1: NF service consumer requesting that the ADRF subscribes to and subsequently stores data or analytics\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Nadrf_DataManagement_StorageSubscriptionRequest service operation to request the ADRF to subscribe to data or analytics. The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/nadrf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/request-storage-sub\" as URI, as shown in figure 4.2.2.3.2-1, step 1. The NadrfDataStoreSubscription data structure provided in the request body shall include:\n-\tone of the following subscription attributes:\n-\tanalytics subscription information within the \"anaSub\" attribute;\n-\tdata subscription information within the \"dataSub\" attribute;\n-\tone of the following target identifiers:\n-\tDCCF or NWDAF instance identifier within the \"targetNfId\" attribute;\n-\tDCCF or NWDAF NF set identifier within the \"targetNfSetId\" attribute;\nand may include:\n-\tformatting instructions within the \"formatInstruct\" attribute;\n-\tprocessing instructions within the \"procInstruct\" attribute or the \"multiProcInstructs\" attribute if the \"MultiProcessingInstruction\" feature is supported.\nNOTE 1:\tThe parameters provided by the NF service consumer, including Formatting and Processing Instructions (if provided) are used by the ADRF when subscribing to a DCCF or NWDAF for Data or Analytics to be stored.\n-\tstorage handling information within the \"storeHandl\" attribute, if the \"EnhDataMgmt\" feature is supported.\n-\ta data set tag to be associated with this subscription and with the data or analytics collected based on this subscription within the \"dataSetTag\" attribute, if the \"EnhDataMgmt\" feature is supported.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/nadrf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/request-storage-sub\" as URI and NadrfDataStoreSubscription data structure as request body, the ADRF shall assign a transaction reference identifier to this request and, if the request is successfully processed and accepted, the ADRF shall respond with \"200 OK\" as shown in figure 4.2.2.3.2-1 step 2, with the message body containing an NadrfDataStoreSubscriptionRef data structure, which shall include the assigned transaction reference identifier as \"transRefId\" attribute.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the data and/or analytics is already stored or being stored in the ADRF, the ADRF will still assign a new transaction reference identifier if the ADRF intends to not really store the data again in the memory again based on the implementation.\nIf an error occurs when processing the HTTP POST request, the ADRF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.\nIf the ADRF receives storage handling information in the request but determines (e.g. based on local policy) that a different storage approach shall be followed, it indicates the determined storage approach to the consumer by setting accordingly the \"storeHandl\" attribute (e.g. providing a different lifetime, or omitting the deletion notification URI to indicate that no deletion alerts will be sent) in the message body of the response. When more than one consumer has requested storage lifetime for the same data or analytics, the storage approach should be based on the longest requested storage lifetime.\nNOTE 3:\tThe default operator policy for how long data or analytics are to be stored can be longer or shorter than the lifetime requested by the consumer. A default operator policy can for example accept only consumer requested lifetimes that are shorter or longer than the default policy.\nIn the case of a successful response, the ADRF may subsequently create a data or analytics subscription (according to inputs that had been received in the NadrfDataStoreSubscription data structure; this is not performed if the ADRF determines that the data is already being stored based on an existing subscription) with a DCCF as described in 3GPP TS 29.574 [23] or with an NWDAF as described in 3GPP TS 29.520 [15], and create a mapping between the previously assigned and returned transaction reference identifier and the subscription that is used to serve the transaction.\nThe Nadrf_DataManagement_StorageSubscriptionRemoval service operation is used by an NF service consumer to request the ADRF to remove a subscription for data or analytics.\nFigure 4.2.2.4.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a request to the ADRF to unsubscribe for storage of data or analytics.\nFigure 4.2.2.4.2-1 illustrates a network function service consumer requesting the removal of subscription(s) to storage of data or analytics. The figure depicts the process of deregistering a subscription from a storage service, which involves several steps such as authentication, authorization, and the actual removal of the subscription. The figure highlights the importance of secure and efficient data management in modern network systems.\nFigure 4.2.2.4.2-1: NF service consumer requesting the removal of subscription(s) to storage of data or analytics\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Nadrf_DataManagement_StorageSubscriptionRemoval service operation to request the ADRF to remove subscription(s) to data or analytics that are stored in the ADRF. The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/nadrf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/request-storage-sub-removal\" as URI, as shown in figure 4.2.2.4.2-1, step 1. The POST request body shall contain an NadrfDataStoreSubscriptionRef data structure, which shall include a transaction reference identifier as \"transRefId\" attribute or, if the \"EnhDataMgmt\" feature is supported, a data set identifier as \"dataSetId\" attribute.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/nadrf-datamanagement/<apiVersion>/request-storage-sub-removal\" as URI, if the ADRF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP POST request, the ADRF shall respond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status. Subsequently, the ADRF shall remove the (DCCF or NWDAF) subscription that had been created and mapped to the received transaction reference identifier or the (DCCF or NWDAF) subscription(s) associated to the received data set identifier as described in clause 4.2.2.3, unless this subscription is mapped to further transaction reference identifier(s) (of transactions that are still active) or associated with further data set identifier(s).\nIf errors occur when processing the HTTP POST request, the ADRF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.\nThe Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalRequest service operation is used by an NF service consumer to retrieve stored data or analytics.\nFigure 4.2.2.5.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a request to the ADRF to retrieve stored data or analytics.\nFigure 4.2.2.5.2-1 illustrates a network function service consumer requesting to retrieve stored data or analytics.

If an error occurs when processing the HTTP GET request, the ADRF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.2.7.\nThe Nadrf_MLModelManagement_Delete service operation is used by an NF service consumer to delete stored ML model(s) or ML model address(es).\nFigure 4.3.2.4.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a request to the ADRF to delete stored ML model(s).\n\nFigure 4.3.2.4.2-1 illustrates the process of a network function service consumer requesting to remove stored machine learning models. The figure depicts the interaction between the service consumer, the network function, and the service provider. The service consumer initiates the process by sending a request to the network function, which then communicates with the service provider to remove the specified machine learning models. The figure highlights the importance of efficient communication between different entities in the network to ensure smooth and timely removal of ML models.\nFigure 4.3.2.4.2-1: NF service consumer requesting to remove stored ML model(s)\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Nadrf_MLModelManagement_Delete service operation to remove the ML model(s) that are stored in the corresponding storage transaction. The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP DELETE request with \"{apiRoot}/nadrf-mlmodelmanagement/<apiVersion>/mlmodel-store-records/{storeTransId}\" as Resource URI representing an \"Individual ADRF ML Model Store Record\" resource, as shown in figure 4.3.2.4.2-1, step 1, where \"{storeTransId}\" is the transaction identifier of the stored record that is to be deleted.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP DELETE request with \"{apiRoot}/nadrf-mlmodelmanagement/<apiVersion>/mlmodel-store-records/{storeTransId}\" as Resource URI, if the ADRF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP DELETE request, the ADRF shall:\n-\tremove the storage transaction corresponding stored ML model record;\n-\trespond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code, or with HTTP \"200 OK\" status code with the message body containing, for each of the ML Models that had been stored under the given storage transaction identifier, the MLModelDelResult data structure with the unique ML model identifier in the \"modelUniqueId\" attribute and the result in the \"delResult\" attribute.\nIf errors occur when processing the HTTP DELETE request, the ADRF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.2.7.\nIf the ADRF determines the received HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, the ADRF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\nFigure 4.3.2.4.3-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a request to the ADRF to delete stored ML model(s) based on the unique ML model identifier.\n\nFigure 4.3.2.4.3-1: NF service consumer requesting to remove stored ML model(s)\nThe NF service consumer shall invoke the Nadrf_MLModelManagement_Delete service operation to remove stored ML model(s) based on the unique ML model identifier. The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/nadrf-mlmodelmanagement/<apiVersion>/remove-stored-mlmodel\" as URI, as shown in figure 4.3.2.4.3-1, step 1. The POST request body shall contain a NadrfMLModelStoreRecord data structure. The NadrfMLModelStoreRecord data structure provided in the request body shall include the MLModelInfo data structure in the \"mlModelInfo\" attribute with the unique ML model identifier in the \"modelUniqueId\" attribute.\nUpon the reception of an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/nadrf-mlmodelmanagement/<apiVersion>/remove-stored-mlmodel\" as URI, if the ADRF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP POST request, the ADRF shall remove any stored ML model(s) that match the unique ML model identifier received in the request and respond with HTTP \"200 OK\" status with the message body containing the MLModelDelResult data structure. The ADRF shall include the unique ML model identifier in the \"modelUniqueId\" attribute and the result in the \"delResult\" attribute. If errors occur when processing the HTTP POST request, the ADRF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.2.7.\n",
