            "description": "Network energy saving is of great importance for environmental sustainability, to reduce environmental impact (greenhouse gas emissions), and for operational cost savings. As 5G is becoming pervasive across industries and geographical areas, handling more advanced services and applications requiring very high data rates (e.g. XR), networks are being denser, use more antennas, larger bandwidths and more frequency bands. The environmental impact of 5G needs to stay under control, and novel solutions to improve network energy savings need to be developed.\nEnergy consumption has become a key part of the operators' OPEX. According to the report from GSMA [3], the energy cost on mobile networks accounts for ~23% of the total operator cost. Most of the energy consumption comes from the radio access network and in particular from the AAU, with data centres and fibre transport accounting for a smaller share. The power consumption of a radio access can be split into two parts: the dynamic part which is only consumed when data transmission/reception is ongoing, and the static part which is consumed all the time to maintain the necessary operation of the radio access devices, even when the data transmission/reception is not on-going.\nTherefore, there is a need to study and develop a network energy consumption model especially for the base station (a UE power consumption model was already defined in TR38.840), KPIs, an evaluation methodology and to identify and study network energy savings techniques in targeted deployment scenarios. The study investigates how to achieve more efficient operation dynamically and/or semi-statically and finer granularity adaptation of transmissions and/or receptions in one or more of network energy saving techniques in time, frequency, spatial, and power domains, with potential support/feedback from UE, potential UE assistance information, and information exchange/coordination over network interfaces.\nThe study not only evaluates the potential network energy consumption gains, but also assesses and balances the impact on network and user performance, e.g. by looking at KPIs such as spectral efficiency, capacity, UPT, latency, UE power consumption, complexity, handover performance, call drop rate, initial access performance, SLA assurance related KPIs, etc. The techniques studied could avoid having a large impact to such KPIs.\n",

The relative power value in power consumption model tables for UL reception and/or DL transmission is provided based on the reference configurations. For simultaneous DL and UL transmission for FDD, the power for UL reception is neglected in this study.\nThe power states of power consumption model are provided as Table 5.1-2. Note: The BS power model defined in this study is a simplified model for the purposes of evaluations, considering single-RAT NR BSs only. This does not mean a BS cannot benefit from the identified techniques when serving multi-RAT. Transition among power states, transition time, are implementation specific, and different BS types may support a different number of power states with different characteristics, i.e., power consumption values and required transition time.\nDuring the transition time period, relative power of sleep mode i is assumed to be consumed. For RAN1 evaluation purpose, the values of relative power P for BS Category 1 and BS Category 2 for respective set of reference configurations are provided in Table 5.1-3.\nAdditional transition energy E and total transition time T also include energy and time for both ramping down and ramping up. The values of total transition time for BS power state transition are given in Table 5.1-4, which are the same across different sets of reference configurations for a given BS Category. The values of additional transition energy for reference configuration Set 1, Set 2 and Set 3, with unit in (relative power) * (duration in msec), are provided in Table 5.1-5.\nFor background and discussion related to the power models as well as the corresponding values for relative power, transition time and additional transition energy, see [4][5][6][7] and references therein.\nTable 5.1-2: Power states of BS power consumption model\n\nTable 5.1-3: Relative power values P for reference configuration Set 1, Set 2 and Set 3\n\nTable 5.1-4: Total transition time T for reference configuration Set 1, Set 2 and Set 3\n\nTable 5.1-5: Additional transition energy E for reference configuration Set 1, Set 2 and Set 3\n\nFor scaling method, for non-sleep mode, the scaling can be based on one or more of the following:\n-\tnumber of used physical antenna elements, or TX/RX RUs\n-\toccupied BW/RBs for DL and/or UL in a slot/symbol in one CC\n-\tnumber of CCs in CA\n-\tnumber of TRPs\n-\tPSD or transmit power\n-\tnumber of DL and/or UL symbols occupied within a slot.\nFor active DL transmission, the BS power consumption is provided by\n\nwhere\n-\t is a static part of power for BS in active, which is not scaled based on reference configurations.\n-\tBaseline:\n-\tOptional:\n-\t is a dynamic part of power for BS in active, which is scaled based on reference configuration.\n-\tBaseline: , where ,, is the fraction of active TRxRUs, the ratio between the RF bandwidth and the maximum system BW, and the ratio of PSD per TxRU between the DL transmission and reference configuration, respectively.\n\n-\t is the power part related to PA.\n-\tFor simplicity\n-\tA = baseline: 0.4; optional: 0.1, 0.7;\n-\tFor , in evaluation, company to report the assumption from below:\n-\tIf one value of  is used for evaluation,  for any ;\n-\tIf two values of are used for evaluation,  if ; otherwise,\nFor active UL transmission, the BS power consumption for is provided by\n\nwhere\n-\t is a static part of power for BS in active, which is not scaled based on reference configurations.\n-\t is a dynamic part of power for BS in active, which is scaled based on reference configuration, and  is the fraction of active TRxRUs.\n-\tBaseline:\n-\n-\t when no scaling is applied (i.e. scaling factor is 1).\nNote,\n-\tFor multi-carrier, the total power consumption of BS is calculated as is the sum of the power consumption of each CC; for intra-band multi-carrier with contiguous CCs, the power consumption of each additional CC is scaled by 0.7.\n-\tFor multi-TRP, the total power consumption of BS is assumed as is the sum of the power consumption of each TRP.

                            "text_content": "In Rel-15 NR, time-domain positions of transmitted SSBs within a half frame are semi-statically configured. Further, UE assumes a single periodicity for the transmitted SSBs. The transmission of common signal and channels or reception of random-access signals may limit the gNB ability to use (deeper) sleep modes to save energy. Currently, system information (SI) update mechanism can adapt the parameters in the cell, such as those associated with downlink common and broadcast signals, such as SSB/SI/paging/cell common PDCCH, and/or the periodicity/availability of uplink random access resources.\nTechnique A-1 adapts the transmission pattern (when applicable) of downlink common and broadcast signals, such as SSB/SI/paging/cell common PDCCH, and/or the transmission pattern/availability of uplink random access opportunities. Adaptation of the transmission pattern includes changes to periodicity, time resource locations, and omitting of specific signals/channels. The transmission pattern can be adapted semi-statically or dynamically.\nThe following table captures the simulation results for the technique A-1-1 that use simplified version of SSB, such as only PSS, only PSS and SSS without PBCH, or PSS and SSS with partial PBCH.\nBased on the simulation results, at empty load, one source shows that BS energy saving gain can be achieved by 15.7%~28.3% with only PSS and SSS transmitted from SSB, and half-reduced SIB1 transmission. One source shows that the gain from light SSB only ranges from 0.7% to 4.4%, which slightly increases as the listening periodicity of WUS from UE becomes larger. One source shows that with simplified SSB of PSS, SSS and partial PBCH, for empty load and Set 1 reference configuration, 2.4% BS energy savings can be achieved. One source shows 30.49% BS energy savings with 2-symbol simplified SSB for FR2.\nNo impact on UPT was observed due to empty load.\nTable 6.1.1.2-1: BS energy savings by simplified SSB\n\nThe following table captures the simulation results for the technique A-1-2 by which transmission occasion of one or more common signals/channels, which are SIB1 and SSB based on the submitted results, can be skipped.\nBased on the results,\n-\tOne source observed that statically skipping certain SIB1 transmission occasions under Set 1 reference configuration for BS Category 1 can achieve energy saving gain by 2.6%~3.9% compared to the baseline of 20ms SSB&SIB1 repetition periodicity at low load. No impact to UPT was observed. There is no random-access procedure modelled in the simulation, therefore the impact on access delay/latency is not shown.\n-\tOne source observed that static adaptation of number of SSB can achieve energy saving gain by 0.3%~25.4% at different scenarios with FTP3 model. The gain generally increases when the traffic load becomes lighter while decreases as the SSB periodicity becomes larger. For a same traffic load and SSB periodicity, the gain increases as the number of SSB can be reduced. For FR2 with larger number of SSB for baseline, there is generally larger gain observed than FR1. Due to reduced number of SSB, access delay is increased. Performance of dynamic adaptation of SSB numbers is not provided. There is no random-access procedure modelled in the simulation, therefore the impact on access delay/latency is not shown.\nTable 6.1.1.2-2: BS energy savings by skipping one or more common signals/channels\n\nThe following show the BS energy savings by technique A-1-3, i.e. configuration/adaptation of longer periodicity of common signals and/or uplink random access opportunities.\nBased on the results with static configurations from 9 sources, it can be observed that longer SSB/SIB1 periodicity can bring BS with significant energy savings in most cases (with gains up to 84.8%), compared to a selected baseline, for both BS Categories, under all reference configurations. When other configurations/settings are the same, the saving gain generally increase as the periodicity becomes larger, and decrease as the traffic load increases or the number of SSBs increases. Particularly, there are two sources providing results with SSB periodicity larger than 160ms which is the maximum value that is currently supported, i.e., being 640ms and 1280ms, and observed that together with longer SIB1/RACH/RO monitoring periodicities, then depending on the traffic load, the BS energy saving gain can be 53.6%~7.1% and 83.6%~3.4%, respectively, compared to a baseline with 20ms SSB periodicity.\nThe scheme does not affect the UPT for empty load case. When traffic occurs and load increases, the UPT also significantly decreases. The latency/access delay/UE power consumption increases proportionally as the periodicity of SSB/SIB increases compared to a corresponding baseline.\nPerformance of dynamic SSB/SIB1 periodicity adaptation is not provided.\nTable 6.1.1.2-3: BS energy savings by adapting SSB/SIB1 periodicities\n\nThe following show the BS energy savings by technique A-1-4, configuration/adaptation of transmission patterns of common signals, i.e. Paging or SSB based on the submitted results.\nBased on the results,\n-\tOne source observed that for BS category 1 and at empty load case, statically adapting paging configuration could provide BS energy savings by 0.2%~6.7% when paging load (resource used for paging) is 0.2%~0.5%, and the gain can be up to 42.3% when paging load is increased up to 3.6%. The gain could also increase as the number of SSB increases. Performance of dynamically adapting paging configurations is not provided. The above energy saving gains were achieved with SSB periodicity of 80ms or 160ms.\n-\tOne source observed that having compact SSB (i.e., no time gap between consecutive SSBs) could provide 10.3% network energy saving for BS category 1 and at empty load case in FR2 when SSB periodicity is 20ms. Furthermore, UE power saving can be improved by 4%.\nTable 6.1.1.2-4: BS energy savings by adapting Paging/SSB transmission patterns\n\nThe following show the BS energy savings by the technique A-1-5, adapting common signals, i.e. RACH based on the submitted results.\nBased on the results with multiple static RACH occasion configurations, one source observed that adaptation of RACH occasions can achieve BS energy savings by 14.4%~24.9% for BS Category 1 at empty load case under FR1 TDD compared to 10ms RACH periodicity without adaptation. The gain generally increases as PRACH periodicity increases for the same number of SSBs. Performance of dynamic RACH configuration is not provided.\nOn UPT/access delay/latency, this scheme increases access delay/latency from 10ms to 70ms, proportional to the increased PRACH periodicity.\nTable 6.1.1.2-5: BS energy savings by adapting RACH periodicity/occasions\n\nThe following show the BS energy savings by technique A-1-6, scheduling of SIB1 by SSB, without PDCCH for SIB1, with repetition period 20ms.\nIt is observed by one source that using SSB to schedule SIB1 can obtain 4.8%~14.8% BS energy savings for Set 1 reference configuration for BS Category 1, compared to SSB/SIB1 periodicity of 20ms for both.\nTable 6.1.1.2-6: BS energy savings by scheduling of SIB1 by SSB\n\nThe access latency of legacy UEs may be impacted.\nSpecification impact of the technique(s) may include the following.\nFor (technique A-1-1) simplified version of SSB, such as only PSS, only PSS and SSS without PBCH, or PSS and SSS with partial PBCH:\n-\tsignaling mechanism to inform the UE about the use of simplified version of SSB, if needed,\n-\tchanges to SSB may have impact on SI acquisition, initial access, RRM/RLM measurements, and mobility for legacy UEs and UEs that may not support the technique,\n-\ttechnique may be enabled for a carrier only when legacy UEs are not using the carrier.\nFor (technique A-1-2) skipping of SSB/SIB1 transmission occasion:\n-\tsignaling mechanism to inform the UE about the skipping of SSB/SIB transmission occasions, if needed,\n-\tskipping of common signals and channels, such as SSB and SIB1, may have impact on initial access, RRM/RLM/BM measurements, and performance for legacy UEs and UEs that may not support the technique,\n-\ttechnique may be enabled for a carrier only when legacy UEs are not using the carrier.\nFor (technique A-1-3) configuration/adaptation of longer periodicity of SSB/SIB1 and/or uplink random access opportunities:\n-\tsignaling mechanism to inform the UE about the configuration/adaptation,\n-\tadaption of common signals and channels may have impact on SI acquisition, initial access, RRM/RLM/BM measurements, and performance for legacy UEs and UEs that may not support the technique.\nFor (technique A-1-4) the paging enhancement where paging resources are grouped in a compact manner, potential specification impact of the enhancements from paging transmission includes the following:\n-\tpaging reception procedure (RAN2), i.e., identification of POs and PFs for Rel-18 UEs,\n-\tUEs that do not support the technique are expected to follow legacy paging reception procedure in the cell.\nFor (technique A-1-5) dynamically adapting PRACH periodicity and occasions:\n-\tsignaling mechanism to inform the UE about the RACH enhancement resources,\n-\tpreparation procedure time for dynamic PRACH adaptation,\n-\tUEs that do not support the technique are expected to use legacy RACH resources in the cell.\nFor (technique A-1-6) scheduling of SIB1 without PDCCH:\n-\tsignaling mechanism to inform the UE about the use of SIB1 without PDCCH, if needed,\n-\tchanges to PDCCH of SIB1 may have impact on initial access, and system information acquisition for legacy UEs and UEs that may not support the technique,\n-\tthe specification impacts may include signalling mechanism to inform the UE about SIB1 transmissions, details of SI acquisition,\n-\ttechnique may be enabled for a carrier only when legacy UEs are not using the carrier.\n",

                            "text_content": "Technique A-3 enables the UE to send an uplink wake-up signal to request transitioning of a cell from no or reduced transmission/reception activity to active transmission or reception of a channel/signal. The technique can be applied to UEs in one or more RRC states. The UE wake up signal (WUS) by technique A-3-1 may be used to trigger the SSB/SIB transmission. It can be used to trigger SSB/SIB1 transmissions with technique A-5. It can also be used to trigger gNB to wake up with technique A-4.\nWith the support of WUS, the gNB might be inactive (e.g., where it does not transmit nor receive signal/channel or where it only transmits and receives limited signals). A gNB can transit to become active for transmitting or receiving a channel/signal upon reception of an uplink signal from the UE, referred to as technique A-3-2.\nThe following capture the results for waking up gNB triggered by UE WUS.\nTable 6.1.3.2-1: BS energy savings by UE wake up signal (WUS)\n\nFor UE WUS triggering SSB/SIB1/RACH for RRC IDLE/INACTIVE/CONNECTED mode by technique A-3-1, based on results from 4 sources, it is observed that, with UE WUS signal triggering a BS of 100% detection assumption,\n-\tWith C-DRX, at low load, one source observed about 50% network energy savings with marginal UE power increment, without UPT loss observed. The scheduling delay when switching to a new gNB is not modelled.\n-\tFor the evaluations with assumption of RRC_IDLE/INACTIVE mode without C-DRX,\n-\twithout DL transmission including DL common signals before gNB reception of WUS, with WUS period of 20ms, 80ms and 160ms, at zero or low load, the network energy savings could be 7.4%~32.1% (6.2%~45.6%), 19.6%~69.6% (6.4%~51.9%), 23.8%~ 83.7% (6.5%~52.5%) respectively by using Category 1 (Category 2) BS power model. The savings can increase as the WUS period increases, and decrease as the traffic load increases. When WUS period is 20ms, marginal UPT loss, access delay/latency increment and UE power consumption increment are observed. The UPT loss and access delay/latency increases as WUS periodicity increases, while there is marginal UE power consumption increment.\n-\tWith sparse SSB of 160ms periodicity transmitted before gNB reception of WUS, at zero or low load, 27.3%~29.7% (18.1%~19.1%), 60.4%~66.6% (18.3%~19.4%), 72.8%~80.7% (18.3%~19.4%) network energy savings can be achieved with WUS period of 20ms, 80ms and 160ms respectively by using Category 1 (Category 2) BS power model. When WUS period is 20ms, marginal UPT loss, access delay/latency increment and UE power consumption increment are observed. The UPT loss and access delay/latency increases as WUS periodicity increases, while there is marginal UE power consumption increment.\n-\tNote: gNB coordination for WUS reception is assumed. Resource configuration for WUS is not specifically modelled, while one source assumes the configuration of WUS can be obtained from a camping cell. For the case of no DL transmission, gNB synchronization is further assumed.\n-\tNote: For evaluation results from 2 sources, it is assumed that UE achieves timing for the UL WUS transmission from the other cell. For evaluation results from 2 sources, it is assumed that UE achieves synchronization with the gNB targeting for energy saving by utilizing discovery signal from the same cell, and one source assumed the discovery signal contains PSS only and its use is to help the UE to get synchronized and to be able to transmit an uplink triggering signal. The differentiation of multiple gNBs which have detected the WUS is not modelled.\n-\tThe detection of WUS is assumed to be ideal. False triggering for detection of targeting gNB is not considered.\nFor UE WUS triggering gNB to wake up in case of uplink traffic arrival by technique A-3-2, for RRC_CONNECTED without C-DRX, and without DL common signals/DL transmission other than PDCCH carrying UL grant, with the assumption of a separate receiver used and 100% detection assumption, at low load, 1 source observed that,\n-\tWith WUS detection power of 10, 55 or, with 90 which has the same active UL power,\n-\tWhen the WUS periodicity is same as the baseline of SR periodicity, 77.8%~93%, 66.7%~92.8% or 57.2%~76.4% network energy savings could be achieved respectively;\n-\tWhen the WUS periodicity is smaller than the SR periodicity of the baseline, 76.3%~92%, 46.7%~78% or 25.7%~67.1% network energy savings could be achieved respectively;\n-\tFor each case, the gain generally increases as the WUS periodicity increases and decreases as the traffic load increases. The gain could also increase as the gNB detection power decreases.\n-\tThere is latency reduction observed, which could increase as the periodicity of WUS decreases. The gain can be up to 45%.\n-\tThe assumption is that gNB needs to wake up to detect SR but can detect WUS during sleep state. gNB is assumed to be in a state such that the main UL receiver is still in deep sleep when detecting wake-up signal and gNB is able to wake up from deep sleep to active in one slot after WUS detection. The WUS receiver is assumed to be active only when detection of WUS signal and becomes 0 power in other time.\nWhen technique A-3-1 is combined with a light version of SSB and on demand SIB1, one source observed 18.7% network energy savings at low load for FR2, assuming the light version of SSB contains PSS only and its use is to help the UE to get synchronized and to be able to transmit an uplink trigger signal.\nLegacy UEs and UEs that do not support this technique cannot wake up a cell that is inactive. Legacy UEs and UEs that do not support this technique are not provided with expected transmission from the cell, therefore they cannot operate in the cell.\nSpecification impact of the technique may include:\n-\tdesign of uplink wake-up signal/channel,\n-\tsignaling details of wake-up signal/channel and if needed, downlink signal/channel design/procedure for carrying information regarding the wake-up configuration,\n-\tconditions for triggering WUS,\n-\tmechanisms for DL synchronization and UE measurements needed prior to WUS transmission,\n-\tUE's assistance information to aid wake up operations by gNB,\n-\tUE behavior/procedure after transmitting WUS,\n-\tmechanism on how the UE can be informed about cell activity or lack of activity.\n",

Currently C-DRX is configured per UE. The alignment of the DRX cycles or offsets for different UEs can be done only via RRC. During UE DRX off period, the UE does not expect to monitor PDCCH, but it is allowed to initiate UL transmission according to the configured resources (e.g. using PUCCH, RACH, SR, or CG-PUSCH). Aligning/Omitting of DRX patterns across multiple UE's can be achieved via gNB implementation.\nTechnique A-4 aims at providing mechanisms informing UE whether the cell stays inactive. This may include enhancements to UE DRX configuration, e.g. to align/omit DRX cycles or start offsets of DRX, for UEs in connected mode or idle/inactive mode, potentially allowing longer opportunities for cell inactivity. During a cell DTX/DRX, the cell may have no transmission/reception or only keep limited transmission/reception. For example, the cell does not need to transmit or receive some periodic signals/channels, such as common channels/signals or UE specific signals/channels.\nThe following captures the results for adaptation of UE DTX/DRX.\nTable 6.1.4.2-1: BS energy savings by adaptation of UE DTX/DRX\n\nBased on 6 sources results, semi-static UE C-DRX alignment achieves BS energy savings gain by 0.2%~71.4% depending on the traffic, UE DRX configurations, and the assumed baseline, e.g. random DRX offset per UE, or gNB is always ON to provide service to the UE. At low or light traffic load cases, 4 sources show that the gain can be 14.4%~71.4%, while 3 sources show less than 6.7% gain, depending on whether BS and UE active duration are aligned or not; at medium load case, 2 sources show network energy saving gain can be 4.8%~47.8%. According to one source, dropping SSB outside UE active time can achieve the energy savings by 14.4%~70.1% and it is assumed that the UE active durations are aligned and the potential impact on synchronization and UE measurement outside the UE duration is not considered.\nOn UPT, one source shows there is marginal negative impact while one source shows it can be up to 15.5%. Also, one source shows that the impact on UPT varies: when the UE DRX cycle is 160ms and gNB active time is 80ms, the UPT is increased while in other configurations, there can be large UPT loss.\nOn access delay/latency, one source shows marginal increment while one source shows the increment can be up to 50%. Also, about 50% unfinished packet ratio is observed from one source compared to the baseline without UE C-DRX alignment during the evaluation period. The increments are related to the DRX configuration.\nAdditionally, one source shows that at low and medium load, the average EE is increased by up to 28.93% when UE DRX alignment is assumed, whereas for light load case, average EE decreases by up to 12.24% when UE DRX alignment is assumed.\nFor the cell DTX/DRX cases, depending on DTX/DRX occasions, legacy UEs and UEs that do not support the technique may not have impact to idle/inactive/connected mode operations. For example, if DTX/DRX are not applied to common signals and channel required for idle/inactive/connected modes or applied in UE specific manner, legacy UEs and UEs that do not support the technique may not be impacted.\nSpecification impact of the technique may include:\n-\tdesign of cell DTX/DRX pattern/timers/parameters/procedure, if needed,\n-\tconfiguration and indication of cell DTX/DRX information to UE, if needed and applicable,\n-\tUE behavior and procedures when cell DTX/DRX is in operation and/or when UE DRX is configured, if needed,\n-\tpotential channel/signal design and mechanism and uplink procedure (e.g., UE request or assistance feedback) related to cell DTX/DRX,\n-\tenhancements to UE DRX configuration\n-\tenhancements to UE DRX parameter adaptation.\nCell DTX/DRX is applied to at least UEs in RRC_CONNECTED state. A periodic Cell DTX/DRX (i.e., active and non-active periods) can be configured by gNB via UE-specific RRC signalling per serving cell. Below examples on Cell DTX/DRX behaviour during non-active periods are assumed to be possible options, and the UE behaviour/impact will be studied:\n-\tExample 1: gNB is expected to turn off all transmission and reception for data traffic and reference signal during Cell DTX/DRX non-active periods.\n-\tExample 2: gNB is expected to turn off its transmission/reception only for data traffic during Cell DTX/DRX non-active periods (i.e., gNB will still transmit/receive reference signals)\n-\tExample 3: gNB is expected to turn off its dynamic data transmission/reception during Cell DTX/DRX non-active periods (i.e., gNB is expected to still perform transmission/reception in periodic resources, including SPS, CG-PUSCH, SR, RACH, and SRS).\n-\tExample 4: gNB is expected to only transmit reference signals (e.g., CSI-RS for measurement).\nThe study focus on UE behavior when at any point in time the cell activates a single DTX/DRX configuration. It is up to NW whether legacy UEs can access cells with Cell DTX/DRX.\nThe Cell DTX/DRX mode can be activated/de-activated via dynamic L1/L2 signalling and UE-specific RRC signaling. Both UE specific and common L1/L2 signalling can be considered for activating/deactivating the Cell DTX/DRX mode.\nCell DTX and Cell DRX modes can be configured and operated separately (e.g., one RRC configuration set for DL and another for UL). Cell DTX/DRX can also be configured and operated together. At least the following parameters can be configured per Cell DTX/DRX configuration: periodicity, start slot/offset, on duration. Details related to UE behaviour can be discussed during WI phase. Whether to support multiple Cell DTX/DRX configurations can be discussed later in the WI phase.\nIt is beneficial to align UE DRX with Cell DTX and DRX alignment among multiple UEs. The alignment mechanism can be discussed during the WI phase.\nFrom RAN2 perspective, Cell DTX/DRX is feasible.\n6.1.4.5\tImpacts on network interfaces\nThe cell DTX/DRX information is considered necessary to be exchanged and coordinated between neighbour gNBs. The gNB can use the received cell DTX/DTX information to determine its own cell DTX/DRX configuration for network energy saving purpose.\nNote: The details of cell DTX/DRX is finally up to RAN1 and RAN2.\n",

When traffic load is low, network may turn off SCell for energy saving. The results are for FR1 only.\nWith one of two carriers having simplified SSB and no SIB1, one source shows BS energy saving gain can be achieved by 31.4%~56.5% compared with a baseline of both carriers having SSB and SIB1 periodicity of 20ms; the same source also shows that with CA configured where SIB1 is already carried by PCell, compared with normal SSB on SCell, the gain of simplified SSB on SCell can be 5.7%~10.5%.\nWith SIB-less only from one of two carriers and SSB is still transmitted,\n-\tone source shows that 33.6%~16.0% BS energy saving gain can be achieved compared with a carrier has 20ms SIB1 periodicity and both SSB and SIB1 are transmitted, and the gain decreases as the traffic load increases.

One source shows that the SCell activation delay can also be reduced to 6ms from the baseline.\nNo negative impact observed on UE power consumption for the above schemes.\nAdditionally, SSB-less SCell for CA can slightly improve the average EE, as observed by one source.\nOne source showed that UE-group PCell switching together with SCell dormancy could provide network energy saving by up to 37.5% for two-CC CA scenario with FR1 Set 1. However, UPT degrades by 14% if one SCell goes to dormant state.\nLegacy UEs or UEs that do not support this feature may not be able to operate inter-band CA with SSB-less SCells. A carrier without SSB cannot be operated as a PCell/PSCell for legacy UEs. The carrier cannot be operated as an SCell for legacy UEs if another intra-band carrier with SSB is not present. At least the feasibility and/or potential requirements of acquiring synchronization/measurements (including AGC aspects) from other cell with SSB transmission in inter-band CA needs study.\nFor SSB-less inter-band CA, specification impact of the technique may include:\n-\tRACH procedures in SSB-less SCell for inter-band CA,\n-\tenhancement on SCell activation procedure,\n-\tenhancements on SCell dormancy operation,\n-\tdesign for new simplified signal/channel (if supported) and related procedures.\nFor UE-group PCell switching, specification impact may include:\n-\tmechanism to signal PCell switching,\n-\tUE behavior based on indicated signalling.\n",

Moreover, the current framework allows UE to be configured with multiple CSI-RS resources, where these CSI-RS configurations may be with respect to different numbers of spatial antenna ports or antenna elements. With CSI reports respect to different number of spatial elements available, gNB is able to dynamically adjust the number of spatial elements for PDSCH transmission in current specification. CSI-RS and CSI reporting configurations are BWP-specific, and BWP adaptation framework can be utilized for the adaptation for a UE capable of multiple BWPs and dynamic BWP switching.\nIndication for potential enhancements related to spatial element adaptation may help the UEs to adapt the already configured CSI-RS configuration such as dynamic/semi-persistent ON-OFF of CSI-RS or to reconfigure the CSI-RS configuration, with respect to adapted number of spatial elements/ports.\nTechnique C-1 aims to enhance dynamically adaptation of spatial elements such as the number of active transceiver chains or the number of active antenna panels at gNB in transmitting and/or receiving channels and signals.\nThe following captures the results for (dynamic) adaptation of spatial elements.\nTable 6.3.1.2-1: BS energy savings by adaptation of spatial elements\n\n12 sources observed that BS energy savings can be achieved, at all loads for different sets of reference configurations with FTP3 for FTP3 IM traffic models, with or without UE C-DRX configuration.

No performance analysis was provided for broadcast and common channels with dynamic antenna adaptation.\nWith dynamic/semi-static adaptation of spatial elements,\n-\tOne source shows that BS energy saving for UE specific PDSCH for FR1 can be achieved by 3.4%~19.6% with dynamic adaptation and multi-CSI, compared to dynamic adaptation of spatial elements with single CSI report. The UPT loss was observed by less than 10%;\n-\t3 sources show that the gain for UE specific PDSCH for FR1 can be 6.8%~31.3% with dynamic adaptation and multi-CSI, compared with no adaptation, with UPT loss of 0.02%~7%;\n-\t2 sources show that the gain can be 6.7%~26.5% with dynamic adaptation without multi-CSI, compared to no adaptation, with UPT loss of 0.3%~18.5%;\n-\t9 sources show that the gain can be 4.8%~48.2% with static adaptation without multi-CSI, compared to no adaptation, with UPT loss of 0.02%~87.08%.

The UPT loss is observed by 9.06%;\n-\tMore number of elements are reduced, more gain can be generally obtained.\nOn latency, there is negative impact observed in three sources and the increment becomes larger as the number of reduced antenna ports becomes larger.\nOn UE power consumption, 2 sources show that there is increase by up to 79.99% (when number of TX RU is reduced from 64 to 8).\nAdditionally, one source shows that the average EE can be generally increased except for the low load case where number of antennas is reduced from 64 to 16, and the case of antenna number variably changing.\nThere is no impact for legacy UEs if the spatial element adaptation is used on a UE-specific basis, i.e., applied only for UEs supporting the technique.\nSpecification impact of the technique may include:\n-\tmechanisms to indicate spatial element adaptation to the UE,\n-\tsignaling to update the active CSI-RS configurations,\n-\tenhancements on CSI-RS (re)configuration, CSI/RRM/RLM measurements, CSI reporting (e.g., multiple CSI reports), and beam management for gNB to switch between different spatial domain configurations,\n-\tassociated UE behavior in case of spatial element adaptation occurs, if needed, e.g., measurements, CSI feedback, power control, PUSCH/PDSCH repetition, SRS transmission, TCI configuration, beam management, beam failure recovery, radio link monitoring, cell (re)selection, handover, initial access, etc.\n",

            "description": "Network energy savings for NR have been studied for both FDD and TDD, both FR1 and FR2. Power model comprised of different BS power states/modes for BS power consumption is defined in clause 5 for evaluation purpose by using relative power, which includes different sleep and active states (including DL transmission and UL reception), and two types of BS categories. A scaling approach considering BS power split by a static part of power and a dynamic part of power is established for evaluation purpose, reflecting the relationship of BS power consumption with respect to transmission resources/configurations in time, frequency, spatial and power domain.\nThe potential techniques for enabling/improving network energy savings in various domains are evaluated and analysed, as documented in clause 6.1- 6.4. Techniques description, performed evaluations and performance impact on selected KPIs including UPT, access delay, latency, UE power consumption, or on averaged energy efficiency etc., as well as legacy UE impact and specification impact are summarized therein. The relevant higher layer procedures and analysis for some techniques are also included in clause 6.1. Other common aspects from higher layer are studied and the outcome is documented in clause 6.5.\nThe study of time domain techniques can be summarized as follows.\nDepending on factors such as selected baselines, BS categories, SLS configurations (including reference configurations, traffic models, number/periodicity of reference signals), scaling parameters, and UE profiles (including UE RRC_IDLE/INACTIVE/CONNECTED mode, DRX configurations), as well as conditions (such as gNB detection, gNB coordination, UE ability of synchronization) etc.,\n-\t4 sources show technique A-1-1 of simplified SSB without PBCH or with partial PBCH could achieve BS energy savings by 0.7%~30.49% in range, with no observed impact on UPT due to empty load.\n-\t2 sources show technique A-1-2 of static skipping one or more of SSB/SIB1 transmission could achieve BS energy savings by 0.3%~25.4% in range, meanwhile the impact on access delay/latency is not provided in the simulation.\n-\t9 sources show technique A-1-3 of statically adapting the periodicity of SSB longer than 20ms up to 1280ms (with current maximum periodicity being 160ms) could achieve BS energy savings by 0.9%~84.8% in range, meanwhile when traffic occurs and load increases, the UPT significantly decreases and the latency/access delay/UE power consumption increases proportionally as the periodicity of SSB/SIB increases compared to a corresponding baseline.\n-\t2 sources show technique A-1-4 of statically adapting Paging (by 1 source) or SSB transmission patterns (by 1 source), could achieve BS energy savings by 0.2%~42.3% in range for Paging enhancement or 10.3% for SSB enhancement, meanwhile UPT/latency impact are not reported.\n-\t1 source shows technique A-1-5 of statically adapting RACH periodicity/occasions could achieve BS energy savings by 14.4%~24.9% in range, meanwhile access delay/latency is increased from 10ms to 70ms, proportional to the increased PRACH periodicity.\n-\t1 source shows technique A-1-6 of scheduling SIB1 by SSB could achieve BS energy savings by 4.8%~14.8% in range without report of impact on UPT/latency as irrelevant to the technique.\n-\t5 sources show technique A-3-1 of UE WUS triggering gNB for SSB/SIB/RACH, with the assumption of ideal detection of UE WUS, could achieve BS energy savings by 6.2%~80.7% in range with UPT loss by 0%~24.2%, while 1 source shows technique A-3-2 of UE WUS triggering gNB to wake up in case of uplink traffic arrival could achieve BS energy savings by 25.7%~93% in range, with latency reduction of 0%~45.5% depending on the SR periodicity assumed in the baseline,\n-\tNote technique A-3-2 of UE WUS triggering gNB to wake up in case of uplink traffic arrival assumes that gNB can detect WUS during sleep state.\n-\t6 sources show technique A-4 of semi-static UE C-DRX alignment could achieve BS energy savings by 0.2%~71.4% in range, meanwhile, 3 sources show that there is negative impact on UPT with loss from 0.91% to 15.5%, and 1 source shows that when the UE DRX cycle is 160ms and gNB active time is 80ms the UPT is increased while in other configurations there can be large UPT loss (up to 62.4%), 1 source shows marginal increment on latency while 1 source show up to 50% latency increase.\n-\t3 sources show technique A-5-2 of on-demand SSB/SIB1 could achieve BS energy savings by 2.6%~43.4% in range, meanwhile performance impact of on demand SSB/SIB was not provided.\n-\tTechnique A-1-4 of adapting Paging and technique A-1-5 of adapting RACH periodicity/occasions may be used in a cell where legacy UE can still use legacy Paging/RACH resources with negative impact on latency for legacy UEs, while other techniques except technique A-3 and A-4 may be enabled for a carrier only when legacy UEs are not using the carrier.\n-\tFor technique A-3, legacy UEs cannot wake up a cell that is inactive, and cannot operate in the cell if not provided with expected transmission from the cell; for technique A-4, depending on DTX/DRX configuration, legacy UEs may not be impacted.\n-\tTechnique A-4 of adaptation of Cell DTX/DRX is also studied in higher layer. From RAN2 perspective, technique A-4 is considered feasible and it is also beneficial to align UE DRX durations with Cell DTX and DRX durations among multiple UEs.\n-\tTechnique A-3 of UE WUS is also discussed in higher layer and from RAN2 perspective, it is feasible if RAN1 agrees to support WUS, and details can be discussed in normative phase if supported.\nFor techniques in frequency domain, the study can be summarized as follows.\nUnder various conditions,\n-\t8 sources show technique A-5-1 (for non-CA) or B-1-1 (for CA) of SSB- and/or SIB1-less operation in two carriers deployment could achieve BS energy savings by 0.3%~98.4% in range on the energy saving cell/carrier and if more information, such as system information, needs to be transmitted at the anchor carrier then 2.3%~18.9% BS energy increases on the associated cell/carrier, meanwhile the UPT/UE power consumption is not negatively impacted while 1 source shows slightly increased UPT and 1 source shows reduced SCell activation delay, assuming UE sync is based on SSB from anchor carrier and UE measurement is not considered,\n-\tA cell without SSB (or SIB1) cannot be operated as PCell/PSCell/inter-band SCell (or PCell for SIB1-less) for legacy UEs. Mobility performance impact(s) (for techniques A-5-1 of SSB-less operation in non-CA), or performance impact(s) due to lack of AGC and cell measurement (for techniques B-1-1 of SSB-less operation in CA) is not provided. For non-CA operation with both SSB-less and SIB1-less, comparison to CA is not provided.\n-\t1 source shows technique B-1-2 of dynamic UE-group PCell switching could achieve BS energy savings by 5.8%~37.5% in range, meanwhile UPT degrades by 14% if one SCell goes to dormant state.\n-\t1 source shows technique B-2 of statically BWP adaptation of BW reduction for multiple UEs within a carrier could achieve BS energy savings by 17.4%~52.2% in range, while the reported UPT loss ranges from 6.1%~28.2%.\n-\t2 source show technique B-3 of BW adaptation of multiple UEs within a BWP could achieve BS energy savings by up to 1.75%, and 1 source shows negative energy saving gains (i.e. energy consumption increase) up to 75.4% with significant UPT loss (up to 88%).\n-\tEvaluation of all techniques is based on the baseline BS power model in Clause 5.\n-\tFrom RAN2 perspective, technique A-5-1/B-1-1 of SCell without SSB in inter-band CA and NES cell without SSB/SIB may need more detailed study in normative phase (if supported) with feasibility up to RAN1. From RAN2 perspective, techniques B-2 is not considered.\nBased on the study and summary, from time and frequency domain,\n-\tTechnique A-4 of adaptation of DTX/DRX, including the alignment of Cell DTX/DRX with UE DRX, is beneficial for network energy savings.\n-\tAdaptation/reduction/elimination of common channels/signals (UE WUS can also be considered) in single or multi-carrier operation are beneficial for network energy savings.\nFor techniques in spatial domain, over baseline of 32/64 TxRU for a gNB/TRP, the study can be summarized as follows,\n-\t12 sources show technique C-1 of adaptation of spatial elements could achieve BS energy savings by 0~48.2% in range, with legacy UE co-existence, at the expense of small (less than 10% for dynamic adaptation with multi-CSI) to large (up to 87.08% for static adaptation) negative impact on UPT. 4 sources provide evaluation results for dynamic adaptation while 9 sources provide evaluation result for static adaptation.\n-\t3 sources show technique C-2 of TRP muting in multi-TRP operation could achieve BS energy savings by 19.7%~41.6% in range, at the expense of UPT loss of 7.27%~22% for static TRP muting. 1 source provides evaluation results for dynamic adaptation while 2 sources provide evaluation results for static adaptation.\nBased on the study, at least a technique based on C-1 is beneficial for network energy savings, and can be recommended. Technique C-2 also has the potential to provide large network energy saving gain.\nFor techniques in power domain, the study can be summarized as follows,\n-\t10 source show technique D-1 of transmission power reduction on PDSCH could achieve BS energy savings by 2.3%~51.5% in range, with legacy UE co-existence, with UPT loss of 0~19.49%/latency increment of up to 24.21%/UE power consumption increment of up to 14.78%. 2 sources provide evaluation results for dynamic adaptation while 8 sources provide evaluation results for static adaptation.\n-\t1 source shows technique D-2 of over the air digital pre-distortion, technique D-3 of channel aware tone reservation, and technique D-5 of UE post-distortion, could achieve BS energy savings by 8.9%, by 2.1%~9.5%, and by 16.1% respectively, with no/negligible negative impact on UPT/UE power consumption, with PA scaling values not covered by the scaling of power model in clause 5.\nBased on the study, at least a technique based on D-1 is beneficial for network energy savings.\nFor other higher layer aspects for network energy savings, from their perspective, the study can be summarized as follows.\n-\tIt is feasible to handle legacy UEs and NES-capable UEs via cell (re-)selection techniques. It is also feasible and possible to enhance the CHO framework to handover UEs faster.\n-\tGroup HO is not considered.\n-\tInter-node beam activation and paging enhancement need more study in normative phase, if supported.\n-\tA means that one can prevent legacy UEs from camping on NES cells (of which definition can be left to WI phase), and/or allow NES-capable UEs to (down-)prioritize specific NES cell(s) on specific frequency, is needed, which is left to the WI phase depending on whether the existing mechanism for cell (re)selection is sufficient according to the NES techniques specified.\nIt is recommended that the normative phase includes not only energy saving techniques (the necessary enhancements would need to be further identified during the normative phase) but also the mitigation of their impacts when network applies network energy savings technique(s).\nFor FR1, at least urban macro is prioritized. Urban micro can be optionally considered. For FR2, urban micro is prioritized.\nFTP3 (0.5MB as packet size, 200ms as mean inter-arrival time), FTP3 IM (0.1MB as packet size, 2s as mean inter-arrival time) and VOIP can be considered in the evaluation. It is up to company report which traffic model is used among the agreed three traffic models in their evaluations. Other models may be used as well, and parameter (e.g. packet size and arrival rate) adjustment can be optionally considered and reported.\nIn the evaluation,\n-\ta load (L)% of a cell is a percentage of resources used for UE specific PDSCH/PUSCH.\n-\tThe following load scenarios are considered.\nTable A-1\n\nIt is up to company report the use of UE C-DRX.\n-\tthe baseline configuration (for alignment/calibration) for C-DRX, if reported, can be as below;\n-\tOther inactivity timer values can be optionally reported.\nTable A-2\n\nFor FR1, the baseline SLS assumptions is provided as below.
