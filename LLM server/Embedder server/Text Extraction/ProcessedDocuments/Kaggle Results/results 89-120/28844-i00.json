                    "text_content": "As described in TR 23.737 [8], there are two main categories of satellite payloads including transparent or re-generative. The implementation of the satellite access architecture can have several forms. The implementation of the transparent satellite is shown in Figure 4.2-1:\nFigure 4.2 illustrates a 5G network with transparent satellite enabled Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) Radio Access Network (RAN). The figure showcases the integration of satellite communication with terrestrial 5G infrastructure, enabling seamless connectivity across various geographical locations. The satellite communication is depicted as a transparent layer, allowing for uninterrupted data transmission without the need for complex network reconfiguration. The figure highlights the importance of this technology in bridging the digital divide, particularly in remote and hard-to-reach areas. The integration of satellite communication with 5G NR-RAN ensures high-speed, low-latency connectivity, which is crucial for emerging applications such as remote healthcare, smart agriculture, and disaster management.\nFigure 4.2-1: 5GS with transparent satellite enabled NR-RAN\nThe transparent satellite access network is composed of:\n-\tSatellite enabled UEs, such as IoT devices, broadband vehicular or fixed terminals.\n-\tSatellite is equivalent to a Radio Frequency (RF) Remote Unit, and is full transparent to the New Radio protocols, including the physical layer.\n-\tRemote Radio Unit, including gateways and gNBs.\n-\t5G CN is accessing these gNBs and DN.\nFor the case of re-generative mode, the satellite may have some functions of 5GC. One implementation is shown in Figure 4.2-2, where the satellite payload may implement a full gNB supporting a satellite enabled NR-RAN. A Satellite Radio Interface (SRI) transports the N1/N2/N3 interfaces between the on-ground 5G CN and the on-board gNB-CU.\nFigure 4.2 illustrates a 5G network with regenerative satellite capabilities and an on-board gNB, showcasing the integration of NR-RAN and satellite technology. The figure depicts the network architecture, including the gNB, eNB, and the satellite communication link. The satellite is shown as a secondary communication path, enabling coverage extension and backup for remote areas. The figure emphasizes the seamless integration of terrestrial and satellite networks, highlighting the advanced communication capabilities of 5G technology.\nFigure 4.2-2: 5GS with regenerative satellite enabled NR-RAN and on-board gNB\nAnother implementation in Figure 4.2-3 can note that with a regenerative implementation (either with distributed gNB or not) a 5GS can have a global coverage, providing a single 5G CN with global or regional (continental or sub-continental) coverage as well. The Inter-Satellite Links (ISL) can be used between the satellites.\nFigure 4.2-3 illustrates a 5G network with regenerative satellite capabilities enabled through NR-RAN, utilizing ISL (Inter-Satellite Links) for regional or global coverage. The figure showcases the integration of satellite communication with terrestrial networks, enabling seamless connectivity across diverse geographical locations. The diagram highlights the role of satellite terminals, terrestrial base stations, and the core network in facilitating high-speed data transmission and coverage extension. The figure emphasizes the importance of efficient resource management and network orchestration to ensure optimal performance and reliability in such hybrid network environments.\nFigure 4.2-3: 5GS with regenerative satellite enabled NR-RAN, with ISL for regional or global coverage\nIn the existing 5G satellite access network, the satellite works in transparent mode.

The figure depicts the base stations (BSs) and user equipment (UEs) connected through terrestrial infrastructure, while also highlighting the role of satellites in extending coverage to remote areas. The satellite backhaul is represented by the dotted lines connecting the BSs and satellites, emphasizing the crucial role of these high-altitude platforms in enhancing 5G network coverage and capacity. The figure emphasizes the complexity and interdependence of various components in a 5G network, including the core network, radio access network, and satellite systems, highlighting the need for efficient resource management and coordination to ensure seamless connectivity and performance.\nFigure 4.3-1: 5G System with a satellite backhaul\nIn the existing 5G network with satellite backhaul, the satellite network acts as the transport network between gNB and 5GC.\nIn Rel-17, in order to imply different packet delivery latency of backhaul connections over satellite network, satellite backhaul category referring to the type of the satellite (i.e. GEO (Geostationary Orbit), MEO (Medium Earth Orbit), LEO (Low Earth Orbit) or OTHERSAT) have been defined in TS 23.501 [2]. In addition, it is assumed that all backhaul connections for a UE are over a single satellite.\nIn Rel-18, the satellite backhaul may involve multi-hops of ISL (Inter-satellite Link) or multi-types of backhaul connections are over different satellites as shown in the Figure 4.3-2. New satellite backhaul category refers to the type of the satellite (DYNAMIC_GEO, DYNAMIC _MEO, DYNAMIC _LEO, DYNAMIC _OTHERSAT) has been in TS 23.501 [2]. Only a single backhaul category can be indicated.\nFigure 4-3 illustrates the satellite backhaul via ISL (Inter-Satellite Link) or different satellites, showcasing the connection between the ground station and the satellite. The figure depicts the use of multiple satellites to enhance network capacity and redundancy. The ground station is connected to the ISL, which in turn is linked to the satellites. This design allows for efficient data transmission and ensures high availability in case of single satellite failure. The figure emphasizes the importance of satellite positioning and the use of ISL for optimal communication performance.\nFigure 4.3-2: Satellite backhaul via ISL or different satellites\nFor some deployments, UPF may be deployed on the satellite. In these cases, edge computing or local switch via UPF deployed on the satellite may be performed as specified in TS 23.501 [2].\nAs described in TR 23.737 [8], in order to enable GEO satellite edge computing in Rel-18, the UPF and Edge Application Servers (EAS) can be deployed on the satellite. The following figure shows the high level architecture of the Satellite Edge Computing via UPF on board.\nFigure 4-3 illustrates the utilization of Universal Point-to-Point Protocol (UPF) on-board for satellite edge computing. The figure showcases the integration of a satellite with a terrestrial network, enabling seamless communication between the two. The satellite is depicted as a key component, with the UPF on-board facilitating the exchange of data between the satellite and the terrestrial network. The figure emphasizes the importance of efficient data processing and transfer at the edge of the network, highlighting the satellite's role in enhancing connectivity and reducing latency.\nFigure 4.3-3: Satellite Edge Computing via UPF on-board\nAs specified in clause 6.2.3.2 of TS 23.548 [9], due to the IP address(es) of the EAS needs to be resolved by the DNS server that is on the ground first, a PDU session with the UPF on the ground needs to be established. Then, according to the EAS Deployment Information as described in clause 6.2.3.4 of TS 23.548 [9], the SMF selects the PSA UPF or UL CL/BP/local PSA on-board based on the DNAI corresponding to the GEO Satellite ID and other factors.\n",

The flowchart also highlights the importance of security measures, such as encryption and authentication, to protect sensitive data during the registration and charging procedures.\nFigure 5.1.4.1-1: Registration procedure message flow for satellite access charging --- PEC charging\n1.\tA UE is accessing to the network via satellite access and sends the registration request.\n2.\tThe RAN sends N2 message to AMF indicating the type of NR satellite access.\n3.\tFor NR satellite access, the AMF may verify the UE location and determine whether the PLMN is allowed to operate at the UE location\n4.\tRegistration procedure as described in clause 4.2.2.2.2-1 of TS 23.502 [3].\n5.\tAfter successful registration, the Registration Accept message is sent to the UE.

The CHF creates the CDR.\n5ch-c. The CHF acknowledges by sending Charging Data Response [Event] to the AMF.\nThis solution which relying on CHF/5G Converged Charging System for satellite access charging, addresses the Key Issue#1.1.\nAs specified in TS 23.501 [2] clauses 5.4.10 and 5.4.11, when UE is accessing to the network via satellite access, AMF determines the RAT type for NR satellite access, i.e. NR(LEO), NR(MEO), NR(GEO) and NR(OTHERSAT), and provides the indication of RAT type in the N2 interface.\nIn addition, the serving PLMN can enforce mobility restrictions for NR satellite access. N2 connection may be released with cause value indicating that the UE is not in the PLMN serving area. The AMF may initiate deregistration of the UE when an N2 UE Context Release Request is received with cause value indicating that the UE is not in PLMN serving area, as specified in TS 38.413 [13].\nThe AMF reports charging information to CHF about 5G network connection via satellite access, during three chargeable events:\n-\tService request (Start of N2 connection)\n-\tService release (End of N2 connection)\n-\tDe-registration (End of N2 connection with the cause value \"UE not in PLMN serving area\").\nThe service request message flow for satellite access charging, for PEC scenario as example, is shown in Figure 5.1.4.2-1. The message flow is similar to Figure 5.2.2.3.2.1 in TS 32.256 [12], with two enhancements:\n-\tFor NR satellite access, the AMF may decide to verify the UE location and determine whether the PLMN is allowed to operate at the UE location, as described in clause 5.4.11.4 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tThe AMF determines the RAT Type for NR satellite access, i.e. NR(LEO), NR(MEO), NR(GEO) and NR(OTHERSAT).\nThe service release message flow for satellite access charging is the same as Figure 5.2.2.3.4.1 in TS 32.256 [12].\nThe de-registration message flow for satellite access charging is described in the same as Figure 5.2.2.2.8.2 in TS 32.256 [12]. with a key difference:\n-\tThe AMF may deregister the UE when the UE context release request has the cause value specified as \"UE not in PLMN serving area\".\nFigure 5.1.4.2 -1 illustrates the service request message flow for satellite access charging, specifically focusing on the PEC charging model. The figure depicts the interaction between the service provider, the customer premises equipment (CPE), and the charging management entity (CME). The process begins with the customer initiating a service request, which is then forwarded to the CPE. The CPE sends a service request message to the CME, which in turn communicates with the service provider's network to ensure the requested service is available. Once the service is confirmed, the CME sends a confirmation message back to the CPE, which then communicates with the customer. This flow ensures a transparent and efficient billing process for satellite services.\nFigure 5.1.4.2-1: Service request message flow for satellite access charging --- PEC charging\n1.\tService request procedure initiated by UE, accessing to the network via satellite access.\n2.\tThe (R)AN sends N2 message to AMF, indicating the type of NR satellite access.

The figure depicts the process of a satellite user deregistering from the network, which is crucial for billing and resource management. The flow begins with the user equipment (UE) sending a deregistration request to the service provider. This request is then processed by the charging system, which calculates the final charge based on the user's consumption. The deregistration message is then sent back to the UE, completing the process. The figure highlights the importance of accurate billing and resource allocation in satellite communication networks.\nFigure 5.1.4.2-2: Deregistration message flow for satellite access charging --- PEC charging\n1.\tRelease initiated by the (R)AN. The (R)AN determines whether the UE is moving outside the PLMN serving area, based on the mobility restrictions for NR satellite access enforced by the serving PLMN. If the UE is outside the PLMN serving area, the N2 Context Release Request cause indicates the release is requested due to a UE using satellite access moved out of PLMN serving area with the case value specified as \"UE not in PLMN serving area\". As defined in TS 38.413 [13] Clause 9.3.1.2, the NAS cause \"UE not in PLMN serving area\" means that the release is due to the UE not being within the serving area of its current PLMN (for NTN).\n2.\tIf the UE is not in PLMN serving area, the AMF may deregister the UE as described in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.2.3.3 before continuing with the AN Release procedure.\n3ch-a.\tThe AMF sends Charging Data Request [Event] to CHF for the UE successful deregistration, triggered by the \"Deregistration\" trigger, defined in Table 5.2.1.2.1.1 TS 32.256 [12].\n3ch-b.\tThe CHF creates the CDR for this deregistration.\n3ch-c.\tThe CHF acknowledges by sending Charging Data Response [Event] to the AMF.\n4.\tDeregistration procedures, described in step 3-5 in Figure 4.2.2.3.3-1 TS 23.502 [3].\nThis solution which relying on CHF/5G Converged Charging System for satellite access charging, addresses the Key Issue#1.1 and Key Issue#1.2.\nIn order to support the charging of data connectivity via satellite access, SMF needs to determine the service data flow accessed by the satellite and collects satellite access charging information. Therefore, the SMF(CTF) sends the Charging Data Request to CHF for the PDU session charging, which has the following charging information enhancements compared with the Table 6.2.1.2.1 in TS 32.255 [10]:\n-\tRAT type extends to include \"NR(LEO)\", \"NR(MEO)\", \"NR(GEO)\" and \"NR(OTHERSAT)\"\nThe message flow is similar to the message flows for PDU session establishment, modification and release in clause 5.2.2.2 in TS 32.255 [10].\n",

If AMF is aware that satellite backhaul category changes (e.g. at handover), the AMF reports the current satellite backhaul category and indicates the satellite backhaul category change to SMF.\nIf dynamic satellite backhaul is used, i.e. capabilities (latency and/or bandwidth) of the satellite backhaul change over time due to e.g. use of varying inter-satellite links as part of backhaul, the AMF notifies the SMF of the corresponding dynamic satellite backhaul category to serve the PDU Session.

If the UE is allowed to access the service(s) according to the EAS Deployment Information as described in clause 6.2.3.4 of TS 23.548 [9], the SMF selects the PSA UPF or UL CL/BP/local PSA based on DNAI corresponding to the GEO satellite ID and other factors. If the GEO satellite ID changes, the AMF may update the latest GEO Satellite ID to the SMF.\nSince the SMF may obtain GEO satellite backhaul category and GEO satellite ID from the AMF and select the UPF on-board to enable the UE accesses the EAS on-board, the SMF(CTF) can be used to provide the charging information to support the Edge Computing charging with satellite backhaul.\nIf the SMF obtains the GEO satellite backhaul category and GEO Satellite ID from the AMF, the SMF(CTF) sends the Charging Data Request to CHF for Edge Computing charging with satellite backhaul, which adds the following satellite backhaul charging information:\nTable 5.3.4.1.1-1: Extend to Common Structure of PDU Session Charging Information for Edge Computing charging with satellite backhaul (3GPP TS 32.255 [10] –Table 6.2.1.2.1)\n\nThe charging trigger conditions in SMF in TS 32.255 [10] have the following enhancements:\nTable 5.3.4.1.1-2: Extend to Default Trigger conditions in SMF for edge computing Satellite Backhaul (3GPP TS 32.255 [10] – Table 5.2.1.4.1)\n\nThe message flow is based on the charging principles for 5GS usage for Edge Computing specified in clause 5.1.2 of the 3GPP TS 32.257 [14] with the enhancement of the satellite backhaul information for the PDU session charging information.

In these architectures, it is assumed that the MnS producer, CHF, CEF and Billing Domain are owned by the same SSP (ECSP). The charging for EAS on-board deployment could be supported with CEF to enable the charging for MnS producer.\nSince the edge computing via the satellite backhaul only using GEO satellite backhaul category in this release, the SSP itself has the knowledge of all the satellite information, therefore, the EAS deployment charging information needs to add the satellite backhaul information:\nTable 5.3.4.2.1-1: Extend to Structure of EAS Deployment Charging Information \n(3GPP TS 32.257 [14] –Table 6.2.2.1.2-1)\n\nThe message flow is similar with the Figure 5.2.3.2 in TS 32.257 [14] with the enhancement of the EAS Deployment Charging Information.

The Local switching via UPF(s) deployed on satellite only applies on GEO satellite backhaul case and considers only DNNs and slices for 5G VN. The UPF deployed on satellite can act as UL CL/BP/local PSA UPF or act as PSA UPF. This case only supports for unicast traffic forwarding of a 5G VN in this release. The following figure shows the high level architecture of the SSC-to-SSC communications via satellite.\nFigure 5.4.1-1 illustrates the local data switching process within a User Plane Function (UPF) integrated on the network equipment. The figure showcases the interaction between the UPF and the Central Office (CO) through a series of logical and physical connections. The UPF, positioned at the edge of the network, is responsible for processing and forwarding data traffic, while the CO serves as the central hub for network management and control. The figure emphasizes the importance of efficient data processing and management within the network, particularly in scenarios where network resources are limited or latency is a critical factor. The visual representation of the UPF and CO interactions highlights the need for streamlined communication and coordination between these two key components of the network infrastructure.\nFigure 5.4.1-1: Local Data Switching via a UPF on-board\nFigure 5.4.1-2 illustrates the local data switching process within a network, utilizing multiple User Plane Functions (UPFs) on-board. The figure showcases the interaction between the UPFs, the Central Processing Unit (CPU), and the Network Processor (NPU), highlighting the parallel processing capabilities of the system. The UPFs are depicted as separate entities, each handling a specific portion of the data flow, while the CPU and NPU work in tandem to manage the overall processing. The figure emphasizes the efficiency and speed of data processing in this network architecture, which is crucial for handling the increasing volume of data in modern communication systems.\nFigure 5.4.1-2: Local Data Switching via multiple UPFs on-board\nThe VN group communication type(e.g. N6 based/N19-based/Local switch) can be supported by the UPF (s) deployed on satellite. The consumptions of network traffic in operator are different in three types of traffic forwarding methods. For Local switch, the traffic is locally forwarded by a single UPF on the satellite. N19 tunnel may be established between two UPFs deployed on different satellites for traffic between SSCs.

The present document also identified and documented the use cases and key issues, derived the corresponding potential requirements, and developed and evaluated the possible solutions (see clause 5) for satellite charging. The present document made conclusions on the following aspects:\n-\tSatellite access charging in clause 5.1.6.\n-\tSatellite backhaul charging in clause 5.2.6.\n-\tEdge Computing with satellite backhaul charging, including subscriber charging and inter-provider charging in clause 5.3.6; and\n-\tSSC-to-SSC communications via satellite backhaul charging in clause 5.4.6.\nTo support converged charging for satellite in normative work, the business relationships (e.g. SSC, SSP, SMNO) need to be specified, as requirements and solutions for the aspects mentioned above. Whether the User location information needs to be extended and alignment with the CT spec, will be addressed during the normative work on satellite access charging.\n\n\n\n\n",
