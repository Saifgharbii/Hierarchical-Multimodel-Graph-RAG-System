            "description": "The present document is part of a series of Technical Specifications (TSs) that specify charging functionality and charging management in GSM/US networks. The GSM/US core network charging architecture and principles are specified in document TS 32.240 [1], which provides an umbrella for other charging management documents that specify:\n-\tthe content of the CDRs per domain and subsystem (offline charging);\n-\tthe content of real-time charging messages per domain / subsystem (online charging);\n-\tthe functionality of online and offline charging for those domains and subsystems;\n-\tthe interfaces that are used in the charging framework to transfer the charging information (i.e. CDRs or charging events).\nThe complete document structure for these TSs is defined in TS 32.240 [1].\nThe present document specifies the offline and online charging description for MMS charging, based on the functional stage 2 descriptions of the MMS in TS 23.140 [201]. This charging description includes the offline and online charging architecture and scenarios specific to the MMS, as well as the mapping of the common 3GPP charging architecture specified in TS 32.240 [1] onto MMS. It further specifies the structure and content of the CDRs for offline charging, and the charging events for online charging. The present document is related to other 3GPP charging TSs as follows:\n-\tThe common 3GPP charging architecture is specified in TS 32.240 [1];\n-\tThe parameters, abstract syntax and encoding rules for these CDR types are specified in TS 32.298 [51].\n-\tA transaction based mechanism for the transfer of CDRs within the network is specified in TS 32.295 [54].\n-\tThe file based mechanism used to transfer the CDRs from the network to the operator's billing domain (e.g. the billing system or a mediation device) is specified in TS 32.297 [52].\n-\tThe 3GPP Diameter application that is used for MMS online charging is specified in TS 32.299 [50].\nAll terms, definitions and abbreviations used in the present document, that are common across 3GPP TSs, are defined in the 3GPP Vocabulary, TR 21.905 [100]. Those that are common across charging management in GSM/UMTS domains, services or subsystems are provided in the umbrella document TS 32.240 [1] and are copied into clause 3 of the present document for ease of reading. Finally, those items that are specific to the present document are defined exclusively in the present document.\nFurthermore, requirements that govern the charging work are specified in TS 22.115 [101].\n",

Application Data may be of any content type and format.\nbilling: function whereby CDRs generated by the charging function(s) are transformed into bills requiring payment.\nBilling Domain: part of the operator network, which is outside the telecommunications network, that receives and processes CDR files from the network charging functions. It includes functions that can provide billing mediation and billing or other (e.g. statistical) end applications. It is only applicable to offline charging (see \"Online Charging System\" for equivalent functionality in online charging).\nchargeable event: activity utilizing telecommunications network resources and related services for:\n-\tuser to user communication (e.g. a single call, a data communication session or a short message); or\n-\tuser to network communication (e.g. service profile administration); or\n-\tinter-network communication (e.g. transferring calls, signalling, or short messages); or\n-\tmobility (e.g. roaming or inter-system handover); and\n-\tthat the network operator may want to charge for.\nAs a minimum, a chargeable event characterises the resource / service usage and indicates the identity of the involved end user(s).\ncharged party: user involved in a chargeable event who has to pay parts or the whole charges of the chargeable event, or a third party paying the charges caused by one or all users involved in the chargeable event, or a network operator.\ncharging: a function within the telecommunications network and the associated OCS/BD components whereby information related to a chargeable event is collected, formatted, transferred and evaluated in order to make it possible to determine usage for which the charged party may be billed.\nCharging Data Record (CDR): a formatted collection of information about a chargeable event (e.g. time of call set-up, duration of the call, amount of data transferred, etc) for use in billing and accounting. For each party to be charged for parts of or all charges of a chargeable event a separate CDR shall be generated, i.e. more than one CDR may be generated for a single chargeable event, e.g. because of its long duration, or because more than one charged party is to be charged.\ncharging event: a set of charging information forwarded by the CTF towards the CDF (offline charging) or towards the OCS (online charging). Each charging event matches exactly one chargeable event.\ncharging function: entity inside the network domain, subsystem or service that is involved in charging for that domain, subsystem or service.\ncircuit switched domain: domain within GSM / US in which information is transferred in circuit switched mode.\nCredit-Control: mechanism which directly interacts in real-time with an account and controls or monitors the charges, related to the service usage. Credit-Control is a process of: checking if credit is available, credit reservation, deduction of credit from the end user account when service is completed and refunding of reserved credit not used.\ndelivery report: feedback information provided to an originator MMS User Agent by an MMS Relay/Server about the status of the delivery of an MM.\ndomain: part of a communication network that provides network resources using a certain bearer technology.\nforwarded MM: MM originally sent from a sender to an intended recipient which is then forwarded to other recipient(s) and to which a delivery report and/or read-reply report may refer and which may be subject to further forwarding.\nforwarding MMS User Agent: MMS User Agent that is the intended recipient of an MM and that requests forwarding of the MM for delivery to other recipient(s) without having to first download the MM.\nFully Qualified Partial CDR (FQPC): partial CDR that contains a complete set of the fields specified in the present document. This includes all the mandatory and conditional fields as well as those fields that the PLMN operator has provisioned to be included in the CDR. The first Partial CDR shall be a Fully qualified Partial CDR.\nmessage ID: unique identifier for an MM.\nmiddle tier TS: used for the 3GPP charging TSs that specify the domain / subsystem / service specific, online and offline, charging functionality. These are all the TSs in the numbering range from TS 32.250 [10] to TS 32.27x [3x], e.g. TS 32.250 [10] for the CS domain, or TS 32.270 [30] for the MMS service. Currently, there is only one \"tier 1\" TS in 3GPP, which is TS 32.240 [1] that specifies the charging architecture and principles. Finally, there are a number of top tier TSs in the 32.29x numbering range ([50] ff) that specify common charging aspects such as parameter definitions, encoding rules, the common Billing Domain interface or common charging applications.\nMMSE: collection of MMS-specific elements under the control of a single administration.\nMMS Relay/Server (MMS R/S): MMS-specific network entity/application that is under the control of an MMS service provider. \nAn MMS relay/server transfers messages, provides operations of the MMS that are specific to or required by the mobile environment and provides (temporary and/or persistent) storage services to the MMS.\nMMS User Agent: application residing on a user equipment, a mobile station or an external device that performs MMS-specific operations on a user's behalf and/or on another application's behalf. An MMS User Agent is not considered part of an MMSE.\nnear real-time: near real-time charging and billing information is to be generated, processed, and transported to a desired conclusion in less than one (1) minute.\noffline charging: charging mechanism where charging information does not affect, in real-time, the service rendered.\nonline charging: charging mechanism where charging information can affect, in real-time, the service rendered and therefore a direct interaction of the charging mechanism with bearer/session/service control is required.\nOnline Charging System: the entity that performs real-time Credit-Control. Its functionality includes transaction handling, rating, online correlation and management of subscriber accounts/balances.\noriginal MM: (initial) MM sent from a sender to a recipient and to which a delivery report and/or a read-reply report and/or a reply-MM may refer and/or which may be subject to being forwarded.\noriginator MMS User Agent: an MMS User Agent associated with the sender of an MM.\npacket switched domain: domain within GSM / US in which data is transferred in packet switched mode. Corresponds to the term \"GPRS\".\npartial CDR: CDR that provides information on part of a subscriber session. A long session may be covered by several partial CDRs. Two formats are considered for Partial CDRs. One that contains all of the specified fields (FQPC); the second has a reduced format (RPC).\nread-reply report: feedback information to an originator MMS User Agent by a Recipient MMS User Agent about the status of handling/rendering of an original MM in a Recipient MMS User Agent.\nreal-time: real-time charging and billing information is to be generated, processed, and transported to a desired conclusion in less than one (1) second.\nRecipient MMS User Agent: MMS User Agent associated with the recipient of an MM.\nreply-MM: in case of reply-charging the first reply accepted by the  Recipient MMS Relay/Server (after checking the reply charging limitations, such as the latest time of submission) is called a reply-MM.\nsettlement: payment of amounts resulting from the accounting process.\nsubscriber: a subscriber is an entity (associated with one or more users) that is engaged in a subscription with a service provider. The subscriber is allowed to subscribe and unsubscribe services, to register a user or a list of users authorized to enjoy these services, and also to set the limits relative to the use that associated users make of these services.\nuser: an entity, not part of the 3GPP System, that uses network resources by means of a subscription. The user may or may not be identical to the subscriber holding that subscription.\nUser Equipment (UE): a device allowing a user access to network services. For the purpose of 3GPP specifications the interface between the UE and the network is the radio interface. A User Equipment can be subdivided into a number of domains, the domains being separated by reference points. Currently defined domains are the USIM and ME Domains. The ME Domain can further be subdivided into several components showing the connectivity between multiple functional groups. These groups can be implemented in one or more hardware devices. An example of such a connectivity is the TE –  interface. Further, an occurrence of a User Equipment is an MS for GSM as defined in TS 24.002 [202].\n",

The CDF, in turn, generates CDRs which are then transferred to the CGF. \nFinally, the CGF creates CDR files and forwards them to the Billing Domain (BD).\nIn MMS, all charging functions (CTF, CDF and CGF) reside within the MMS R/S. I.e. the MMS R/S is connected directly to the BD via the Bm interface. Bm is the MMS specific variant of the common Bx interface and is functionally equivalent to MM8. This architecture implies that there exists no separate CDF and CGF for MMS, i.e. no corresponding open interfaces between any such functions, within the 3GPP standards.\nFigure 4.2.1 depicts the mapping of the 3GPP common charging architecture, as laid down in TS 32.240 [1], onto the MMS.\nFigure 4.2.1 illustrates the offline charging architecture for Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) in a telecommunications system. The figure showcases the various components involved, including the charging server, MMS server, and the client device. The charging server is responsible for processing the billing information, while the MMS server handles the delivery of multimedia messages. The client device interacts with both servers to send and receive MMS messages. The offline charging architecture ensures that the billing process is completed without the need for an active network connection, providing a reliable and efficient method for charging subscribers for their MMS usage.\nFigure 4.2.1: MMS offline charging architecture\nIn addition to the standard approach depicted in figure 4.2.1, vendors may choose to implement separate CDF and CGF for MMS. In that case, the interfaces between these functions should comply with the definition of the Rf and Ga interfaces (TS 32.299 [50] and TS 32.295 [54], respectively) as much as possible.\n",

The chargeable events that trigger the collection of charging information on the applicable reference points are identical for MMS offline and online charging and are specified below. The use of the events to generate CDRs (offline charging) or Credit-Ccontrol requests (online charging) are described in clause 5.2 for offline charging and in clause 5.3 for online charging, respectively.\nIn line with the requirements laid down in TS 22.140 [200] and TS 23.140 [201] the MMS R/S collects charging information such as:\n-\tthe destination and source addresses applied for an MM;\n-\tidentification of the MMS R/S(s) involved in the MM transaction;\n-\tthe amount and type of user data transmitted in MO and  directions for the transfer of MM; i.e. the size of the MM and its components;\n-\tstorage duration; i.e. the time interval when a MM is saved on a non-volatile memory media;\n-\tidentification of the bearer resources used for the transport of the MM; i.e. the identity of the network and the network nodes;\n-\tin scenarios involving a VASP, the charging information describes the identification of the VASP and the amount of user data sent and received between the MMS R/S and the VASP.\n-\tin scenarios involving the MSCF, additional information supplied by the MSCF.\nThe information listed above is captured for use cases in relation to:\n-\tMM submission;\n-\tMM retrieval;\n-\tMM forwarding;\n-\ttransactions involving the MMbox;\n-\ttransactions involving a VASP.\nRefer to TS 23.140 [201] for further details on the above MM transactions.\nThe following scenarios can be distinguished in MMS charging:\n-\tCombined Originator and Recipient MMS R/S. This scenario covers the case where the Originator MMS R/S and the Recipient MMS R/S are identical, which implies that that particular MMS R/S handles both MM submission and MM retrieval.\n-\tDistributed Originator and Recipient MMS R/S. This scenario covers the case of the Originator MMS R/S and the Recipient MMS R/S being two different entities, where the Originator MMS R/S handles MM submission and the Recipient MMS R/S handles MM retrieval.\n-\tMMBox management. MMBox is a logical entity of the MMS R/S that allow to support the persistent network-based storage of the MMs. This feature is an extension of the MM1 interface that enables a MMS User Agent to store, retrieve and delete incoming and submitted MMs.\n-\tVASP transactions. MMS VAS Application offers value added services to the MMS Users. The MMS VASP are able to interact with the MMS R/S via the MM7 interface using transactions similar to those of the MM1 interface i.e. submission, reception, delivery-report, read-reply report, etc.\nThese scenarios all pertain to atomic actions related to MMs, e.g. submission, retrieval, storage, deletion, etc., implying that MMS only uses event based charging, as specified in TS 32.240 [1] (i.e. session based charging is not applicable for MMS). The following subclauses further describe the above scenarios and illustrate the conditions for the various types of chargeable events based on MMs crossing the reference points identified in TS 23.140 [201] (MM1, MM4 and MM7). The labels in the message flows identify the chargeable events in relation to the particular reference point.\n",

In this scenario the Recipient MMS User Agent is the party to charge for the reception.\nThe given telecommunication figure illustrates the process of message retrieval in an IEC (Industrial Internet Consortium) system. The figure depicts the interaction between the MM1 (Message Manager 1) and the MM2 (Message Manager 2) in the event of a retrieval failure. If the MM1 is unable to retrieve a message due to an issue such as a lack of a MM1_retrieve_Ack response, it will initiate another MM1_retrieve_req request for the same message. The figure demonstrates the OCS (Out-of-band Control Service) logic in action, which determines whether subsequent requests for the same message are charged. The figure is crucial for understanding the system's response to retrieval failures and ensuring efficient message management.\nNOTE:\tFor IEC, if the retrieval process is not successful for any reason (e.g. MM1_retrieve_Ack is not received) and another MM1_retrieve_req is received for the same message (identified by the Message ID), it is OCS logic to determine whether the subsequent requests are charged.\n\nFigure 5.3.2.2.1 : MMS online charging for MM retrieval using IEC\nFigure 5.3.2.2.2: MMS online charging scenario for MM retrieval using ECUR\n\nEditor's note:\tThe completion of this clause is ffs.\nEditor's note:\tThe completion of this clause is ffs.\n\n",

In this case, the Originator address field specifies the address of the originator MMS User Agent of the original MM, whereas the address of the forwarding MMS User Agent is contained in the Forwarding address field.\nTable 6.1.1.2.1: Originator MM4 Forward Request record (O4FRq-CDR)\n\nIf enabled, an Originator MM4 Forward Response O4FRs-CDR shall be produced in the Originator MMS R/S if and when, after an MM has been forwarded with an MM4_forward.REQ to the Recipient MMS R/S, the Originator MMS R/S receives a corresponding MM4_forward.RES from the Recipient MMS R/S.\nTable 6.1.1.3.1: Originator MM4 Forward Response record (O4FRs-CDR)\n\nIf enabled, an Originator MM4 Delivery Report O4D-CDR shall be produced in the Originator MMS R/S if and when the Originator MMS R/S receives an MM4_delivery_report.REQ from the Recipient MMS R/S.\nTable 6.1.1.4.1: Originator MM4 Delivery Report record (O4D-CDR)\n\nIf enabled, an Originator MM1 Delivery Report O1D-CDR shall be produced in the Originator MMS R/S if and when the Originator MMS R/S sends an MM1_delivery_report.REQ to the originator MMS User Agent.\nTable 6.1.1.5.1: Originator MM1 Delivery Report record (O1D-CDR)\n\nIf enabled, an Originator MM4 Read Reply Report O4R-CDR shall be produced in the Originator MMS R/S if and when the Originator MMS R/S receives an MM4_read_reply_report.REQ from the Recipient MMS R/S.\nTable 6.1.1.6.1: Originator MM4 Read Reply Report record (O4R-CDR)\n\nIf enabled, an Originator MM1 ReadRreply Originator O1R-CDR shall be produced in the Originator MMS R/S if and when the Originator MMS R/S sends an MM1_read_reply_Originator.REQ to the originator MMS User Agent.\nTable 6.1.1.7.1: Originator MM1 Read Reply Originator record (O1R-CDR)\n\nIf enabled, an Originator MM Deletion OMD-CDR shall be produced in the Originator MMS R/S, after sending an MM1_submit.RES  to the originator MMS User Agent, if and when:\na)\tthe Originator MMS R/S decides to abandon processing of the MM at any point after receiving the corresponding MM1_submit.REQ; or\nb)\tthe Originator MMS R/S decides to delete the MM because of expiry of storage time, which may either be indicated in the submit request or governed by operator procedure (e.g. after successful MM delivery).\nAbandoning the processing of the MM, or deleting the MM, implies that there remains no knowledge of the MM in the Originator MMS R/S.\nThe status code indicates the precise reason for abandoning or deleting the MM with respect to the MMS transactions specified in TS 23.140 [201].\nThis CDR is created regardless of whether the Originator MMS R/S is also the Recipient MMS R/S or not.\nTable 6.1.1.8.1: Originator MM Deletion record (OMD-CDR)\n\n",
