As documented in TR 23.700-47 [2], the efficiency of resource utilization for the same broadcast content is studied. For the same broadcast content, the AF will set up multiple broadcast MBS sessions towards those CNs. Each CN will deliver the same content towards the same shared NG-RAN node. The NG-RAN node only delivers one copy of the broadcast content over the air.\nAs specified in clause W.4 of TS 33.501 [3], user-plane procedure is applicable for broadcast service. MBSTF may protect the traffic transmission with encryption and/or integrity. The security protection of MBS traffic is supported in service layer. In MOCN network sharing scenario, the multiple CNs may enable their own security towards the content. The UE will receive the MBS keys from their serving PLMN. However, the NR-RAN broadcasts only one copy of the content. The security impact needs analysis if security are activated for the same content to be provided to 5G MOCN network sharing scenarios. For example, UEs from PLMN1 may be unable to decipher the content if the NG-RAN node chooses to broadcast the ciphered content from the CN of PLMN2, since the MTK generated and distributed by the PLMN1 may be different from the MTK that will be used by the PLMN2 to protect the MBS traffic.\nIf the content is protected using CN-specific keys, which is not a serving PLMN for an UE in the shared RAN, then UEs not having the key will fail to properly process the content, should the network send only one of the copies.\n",

Therefore the UEs in a shared RAN even if the serving PLMN are different, will have the same MTK and UEs will be able to handle the protected content even if it is protected by the non-serving PLMN.\nThe security aspects of MOCN deployment scenario to be considered as multiple BM-SC deployment scenario detailed in clause 6.3.4 of TS 33.246 [8] for MBS key management.\nFigure 6.2.2-1 illustrates the process of Mobile Network Operator (MNO) Core Network (CN) generation and distribution for Multi-Operator Core Network (MOCN) deployment scenario. The figure showcases the interaction between the MNOs and the MOCN, highlighting the role of the MOCN in facilitating efficient network resource sharing. The diagram emphasizes the importance of seamless handover and efficient signaling between the MNOs and the MOCN, ensuring optimal performance and coverage for mobile users.\nFigure 6.2.2-1: MTK generation and distribution for MOCN deployment scenario\nFigure 6.2.2-1 includes only the relevant steps specified in TS 23.247 [6] for the AF to provide the MTK and to the NEF/MBSF and details of distribution of the MTK by the NEF/MBSF for MBS traffic protection. As shown in the Figure 6.2.2-1, the steps 1 to 6 are performed for the PLMN-1 and also for the PLMN-2 for the MBS session ID.\n0) The AF generates the MTK, MTK ID, MSK, MSK ID and selects the security algorithm for the MBS session ID. It is up to the AF implementation to select a MCC and MNC among the PLMNs for the Key Domain ID. As mentioned in clause 6.3.2.1 of TS 33.246 [8], the UE should not try to use the MCC and MNC in another context, e.g. the UE should not compare the received MCC || MNC to parameters in radio level.\n1) The AF provides the security data (MTK, MTK ID, MSK, MSK ID and selected algorithm(s)) to the NEF/MBSF.\n2-3) The MBSF includes the received security data in the multicast session security context and provides it to the MB-SMF. The SMF obtains the multicast session security context from the MB-SMF and provides it to the UE, as specified in TS 33.501 [3].\n4-5) The NEF/MBSF provides the received security data to the MBSTF. Upon receiving the security data from the NEF/MBSF, the MBSTF uses the provided MTK for MBS traffic protection, instead of deriving a MTK for the specified MBS session ID.\n6) The NEF/MBSF provides response for the received Nnef_MBSSession_Create request.\nThe UE registers to the MBS service and receives the MBS traffic as specified in TS 33.501 [3] with the following changes:\n- \tThe AF provides the MSK, MSK ID, MTK and MTK ID to the MBS Security Function (MBSSF) for the MBS session ID.\n- \tThe MBSSF uses the provided MSK for protection of the MTK and the provided MTK for MBS traffic protection, instead of deriving MSK and MTK for the specified MBS session ID.\n- \tThe MBSSF delivers the MSK, MSK ID, MTK and MTK ID received from the AF to the UE, as specified in TS 33.501 [3] appropriately.\nThe MTK is updated based on the change of the authorization information or based on the local policy (e.g. key lifetime expiration) as detailed in TS 33.501 [3]. In such cases, the MBSF or MB-SMF in PLMN1 triggers the MTK update procedure by requesting the AF to provide a fresh MTK. The key update request message includes the MBS session ID. If the AF has generated a fresh MTK, the AF provides the fresh MTK to the NEF/MBSF in the Nnef_MBSSession_Update request. Then the refreshed MTK is delivered to the UE as specified in TS 33.501 [3].\nAs both PLMN1 and PLMN2 supports MOCN, the MTK in PLMN2 should also be updated. Therefore, the AF initiates the MTK update procedure for the PLMN2 by sending the updated MTK to the NEF/MBSF in PLMN2, in the Nnef_MBSSession_Update request.\nIf MSK needs to be updated, then the AF provides the newly generated MSK along with the MTK and the associated MSK ID and MTK ID to the PLMNs. Then the refreshed MSK and MTK is delivered to the UE as specified in TS 33.501 [3].\n",

                            "text_content": "Figure 6.3.2.1-1 illustrates the Multi-Operator Core Network (MOCN) broadcast procedure, which involves the coordination of multiple core networks to facilitate seamless communication between different mobile network operators. The figure showcases the interaction between the Home Network (HN) and the Visiting Network (VN), highlighting the process of handover and the exchange of control and user plane information. The diagram emphasizes the importance of efficient network management and inter-operator collaboration in today's increasingly interconnected telecommunications landscape.\nFigure 6.3.2.1-1: MOCN broadcast procedure\nUE#1 belongs to PLMN A, UE#2 belongs to PLMN B, and UE #3 belongs to PLMN C. And corresponding MBSTF, MB-SMF, MB-UPF are independently present for each operator / PLMN A, B and C.\nStep 1. MOCN TMGI allocation is performed by MB-SMF. TS 23.247 [6] can be referred for normal TMGI allocation. Same procedure is followed but the TMGI structure used is MOCN TMGI shown in this document in section 6.3.2.2.\nStep 2. Separate service announcement is made for broadcast services to UE#1, UE#2 and UE#3 by respective PLMNs.\nStep 3. This step is without involving AF option. All operators use unique key id for MOCN and derive the keys for MSK, MTK which is common for MOCN broadcast scenario.\nStep 4. Traffic protection uses common one across all operators.\nStep 5. When the media stream from AF is received to each MB-UPF of PLMN A, B, C, each MB-UPF of each PLMN will forward the media stream to MOCN RAN.\nStep 6. MOCN RAN considers only one media stream content and ignores the rest of the media stream content received from rest of the TMGI. RAN decides based on the common MOCN TMGI ID used in media stream. Clause 6.3.2.2 describes possible ways to arrive at a common MOCN TMGI.\nStep 7. PTM transmission is made from MOCN RAN to all UE of different operators.\nCurrent Temporary Mobile Group Identity (TMGI) is used within MBMS to uniquely identify Multicast and Broadcast bearer services. But this ID is unique to a particular PLMN. Different PLMNs uses their own TMGI id for set of UEs belong to them.\nConsidering the MOCN for broadcast usecase in 5G, TMGI can’t be unique only to one operator and it has to be common across the different PLMNs. This solution proposes four possible ways to arrive at a common MOCN TMGI. Figure 1 illustrates these mechanisms.\nFigure 6.3.2.2-1 presents a schematic of possible mechanisms for a common Multi-Operator Core Network (MOCN) Transport and Multi-Operator Gateway Interconnect (TMGI) setup. The figure illustrates the interaction between multiple network operators, including the core network, the TMGI, and the associated signaling and control mechanisms. The diagram highlights the importance of efficient inter-operator communication and coordination for seamless service delivery and resource sharing. The figure also emphasizes the role of policy control and network management in ensuring interoperability and service quality across the multi-operator environment.\nFigure 6.3.2.2-1: Possible mechanisms for a common MOCN TMGI\n1)\tMBMS service ID and default MOCN MCC and MNC configured by the operators. Values for MCC and MNC can be reserved for MOCN usecase and used across different operators.\n2)\tMBMS service ID and AF ID instead of MNC, MCC. AF_ID is defined in TS 33.535 [7].\n3)\tAddition of new field to include AF_ID with MBMS service ID and with MCC=MNC=Zero.\n4)\tAddition of new field to include MOCN_ID with MBMS service ID and with MCC=MNC=Zero.\nNOTE: \tWhich of these mechanisms should be standardized is not addressed. This can be aligned with SA2.\nConsidering the MOCN for broadcast usecase in 5G, common mechanisms to derive MSK and MTK are required across the different PLMNs. This solution proposes three possible mechanisms for MOCN key identification. This proposal considers configurations of common fields for MOCN. For example, setting Key domain ID to a default value for all PLMNs involved in the MOCN. Figure 2 illustrates these proposed mechanisms.\nMOCN MSK\n1)\tKey domain can be set as default values or set to zero or new MOCN ID can be introduced instead of key domain ID. Differentiation bit needs to be set to show the difference between MOCN ID or key domain ID.MSK ID remains as before 4 bytes.\n2)\tKey domain ID can be set to Zero or default value. MSK ID can remain as before with 4 bytes. MOCN ID can be introduced, and range of values are defined. For many such MOCN use cases, where different broadcast cases of RAN sharing will be assigned a MOCN ID value. MSK ID remains as before 4 bytes.\n3)\tKey domain ID can be set to Zero or default value. MSK ID remains as before 4 bytes. AF ID is newly introduced and assigned the FQDN of AF & security protocol identifier. MSK ID remains as before 4 bytes.\nMOCN MTK\n1)\tKey domain can be set as default values or set to zero or new MOCN ID introduced instead of key domain ID. Differentiation bit needs to be set to show the difference between MOCN ID or key domain ID.MSK ID remains as before 4 bytes & MTK as 2 bytes.\n2)\tKey domain ID can be set to Zero or default.

The figure illustrates different configurations for interworking between different mobile network operators, showcasing the coexistence of different technologies such as GSM, UMTS, LTE, and 5G NR. The figure highlights the importance of efficient resource management and handover procedures to ensure seamless connectivity and optimal performance across various network domains.\nFigure 6.3.2.2-2: Possible options for MSK and MTK for MOCN\nNOTE 1: \tWhich of these mechanisms should be standardized is not addressed.\nNOTE 2: \tHow to derive the same key using common identifiers is not addressed.\nNOTE 3: \tNeed to coordinate with SA2 on proposed TMGI definition.\n",

The diagram emphasizes the importance of multi-operator collaboration in maintaining a secure and efficient communication environment for mobile users.\nFigure 6.4.2-1: Call flow of security protection for UEs in MOCN network sharing scenario\nAs shown in the Figure 6.4.2-1, the details of security protection is summarized as following:\n1.\tAF performs TMGI allocation and MBS session creation as specified in clause 7.1.1.2 or clause 7.1.1.3 of TS 23.247 [6]. The AF may include Associated Session Identifier in this step.\n2.\tNEF/MBSF checks authorization of AF. In addition, NEF/MBSF confirms the security activation status for the MBS session.

When the NG-RAN node receives the DL MBS data of the requested MBS session afterwards, it will not send the received data in the air interface if reusing the network resource. Otherwise, the NG-RAN node treat the session as the newly request session and creates new Broadcast MBS Session Context.\n8-9.\tContinue the procedure as specified in TS 23.247 [6].\n",
