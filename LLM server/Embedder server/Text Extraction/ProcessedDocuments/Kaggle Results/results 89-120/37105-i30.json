                    "text_content": "An AAS BS is distinguished from a non-AAS BS by including a dedicated antenna system in its design.\nThe transceiver to antenna RF interface of the AAS BS (referred to as the transceiver array boundary) comprises one or several TAB connectors. There is no general one-to-one relationship between non-AAS BS antenna connectors and AAS BS TAB connectors, but it can be expected the number of TAB connectors in AAS BS will be greater than or equal to the number of non-AAS BS antenna connectors for respective base stations with corresponding functionality.\nFor the conducted requirements, the AAS BS requirements are formulated in such a way that the impact of what they are meant to regulate is expected to be \"equivalent\" to the corresponding non-AAS BS requirements; i.e. the outside world sees the same level of emissions, power levels, or can expect the same demodulation performance at the UE from the AAS BS as it would from a non-AAS BS with equivalent functionality. All non-AAS BS RF requirements (referenced to the non-AAS BS antenna connector) have been adapted to AAS BS conducted requirements. Many requirements are also direct references to the non-AAS BS RF specifications 3GPP TS 25.104 [2], 3GPP TS 25.105 [3], 3GPP TS 36.104 [4] and 3GPP TS 37.104 [5].\nNOTE 1:\tApplying non-AAS BS antenna connector requirements directly to individual TAB connectors renders certain AAS BS requirements excessively strict from a system perspective.\nNOTE 2:\tBoth specific references and non-specific references occur.\nIn addition, some new OTA requirements are introduced. These requirements have no corresponding non-AAS BS requirements.\nFor a OTA AAS BS there are no conducted requirements. The radiated requirements have been derived based on the principle that they offer the same level of performance and protection as the hybrid AAS BS requirements. The radiated requirements therefore use the same equivalence to the non-AAS requirements. The non-AAS BS RF requirements have therefore been further adapted to apply to OTA metrics in the far field. Some requirements are direct references to the non-AAS BS RF specifications 3GPP TS 25.104 [2], 3GPP TS 25.105 [3], 3GPP TS 36.104 [4] and 3GPP TS 37.104 [5]. Some co-location requirements which have been developed from assumptions on BS-to-BS coupling do not have direct OTA equivalents. The radiated co-location requirements use the same scenarios used to develop the non-AAS RF requirements.\nIn this specification, the term \"requirements for single RAT operation\" refers to requirements that are derived from the 3GPP TS 25.104 [2], 3GPP TS 25.105 [3], or 3GPP TS 36.104 [4] specifications baseline, whilst \"requirements for MSR operation\" refers to requirements derived from the 3GPP TS 37.104 [5] specification baseline (including NR operation as part of MSR).\nNB-IoT in-band, NB-IoT guard band, or standalone NB-IoT operation is not supported by AAS BS. When referring to standalone E-UTRA requirements for single RAT operation in 3GPP TS 36.104 [4] or to E-UTRA requirements for MSR operation in 3GPP TS 37.104 [5], any requirements specified in those specifications for E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in-band or guard band) or for standalone NB-IoT, shall not be considered for the AAS BS. Unless otherwise stated, the exclusion of the NB-IoT requirements in this specification applies to all operation modes (i.e. in-band NB-IoT operation, guard band NB-IoT operation and standalone NB-IoT operation).NR requirements for single RAT operation are not specified in the present document because AAS RF requirements for single RAT NR are fully captured in the NR specification 38.104 [27].\nBand 46 operation and Band 49 operation is not supported by AAS BS. When referring to standalone E-UTRA requirements for single RAT operation in 3GPP TS 36.104 [4] or to E-UTRA requirements for MSR operation in 3GPP TS 37.104 [5], any requiremetns specified in those specifications for Band 46 or Band 49 operation shall not be considered for the AAS BS with E-UTRA.\n",

In addition, for a multi-band TAB connector the requirements apply inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap.\nThe unwanted emission basic limits in the part of the downlink operating band that falls in the spurious domain are consistent with ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 [14].\nEmissions shall use the basic limits specified in the tables below, where:\n-\tf is the separation between the channel edge frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.\n-\tf_offset is the separation between the channel edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.\n-\tf_offsetmax is the offset to the frequency ΔfOBUE  outside the downlink operating band.\n-\tfmax is equal to f_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\nFor a multi-band TAB connector inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gaps with Wgap < 2×ΔfOBUE MHz, a combined basic limit shall be applied which is the cumulative sum of the basic limits specified at the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges on each side of the Inter RF Bandwidth gap. The basic limit for Base Station RF Bandwidth edge is specified in the tables subclause 6.6.5.4.2 to 6.6.5.4.7 below, where in this case:\n-\tf is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.\n-\tf_offset is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.\n-\tf_offsetmax is equal to the Inter RF Bandwidth gap minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\n-\tfmax is equal to f_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\nFor multi-band TAB connector where multiple bands are mapped on the same antenna connector, the operating band unwanted emission basic limits apply also in a supported operating band without any carrier transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s) transmitted in other supported operating band(s). In this case where there is no carrier transmitted in an operating band, the operating band unwanted emission limit, as defined in the tables of the present subclause for the largest frequency offset (fmax), of a band where there is no carrier transmitted shall apply from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency, up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the supported downlink operating band without any carrier transmitted. And no cumulative basic limit is applied in the inter-band gap between a supported downlink operating band with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink operating band without any carrier transmitted.\nFor a multicarrier E-UTRA TAB connector or a TAB connector configured for intra-band contiguous or non-contiguous carrier aggregation the definitions above apply to the lower edge of the carrier transmitted at the lowest carrier frequency and the upper edge of the carrier transmitted at the highest carrier frequency within a specified frequency band.\nIn addition inside any sub-block gap for a TAB connector operating in non-contiguous spectrum, a combined basic limit shall be applied which is the cumulative sum of the basic limits specified for the adjacent sub blocks on each side of the sub-block gap. The basic limit for each sub block is specified in the tables subclause 6.6.5.4.2 to 6.6.5.4.7 below, where in this case:\n-\tf is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block edge.\n-\tf_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.\n-\tf_offsetmax is equal to the sub-block gap bandwidth minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\n-\tfmax is equal to f_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.\nFor an AAS BS of Wide Area BS class, the requirements of either subclause 6.6.5.4.2 (Category A limits) or subclause 6.6.5.4.3 (Category B limits) shall apply.\nFor an AAS BS of Local Area BS class, the requirements of subclause 6.6.5.4.4 shall apply (Category A and B).\nFor an AAS BS of Medium Range BS class, the requirements in subclause 6.6.5.4.5 shall apply (Category A and B).\nThe application of either Category A or Category B basic limits shall be the same as for Transmitter spurious emissions (Mandatory Requirements) in subclause 6.6.6.\nFor E-UTRA TAB connector operating in Bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 44, 68, 71, 72, 73, 85, 87, 88 the basic limits are specified in tables 6.6.5.4.2-1 to 6.6.5.4.2-3.\nTable 6.6.5.4.2-1: Wide Area BS operating band unwanted emission limits for 1.4 MHz channel bandwidth (E-UTRA bands <1GHz) for Category A\n\nTable 6.6.5.4.2-2: Wide Area BS operating band unwanted emission limits for 3 MHz channel bandwidth (E-UTRA bands <1GHz) for Category A\n\nTable 6.6.5.4.2-3: Wide Area BS operating band unwanted emission limits for 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz channel bandwidth (E-UTRA bands <1GHz) for Category A\n\nFor a E-UTRA TAB connector operating in Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 48, 50, 52, 54, 65, 66, 69, 70, 74, 75 emissions shall use the basic limits specified in tables 6.6.5.4.2-4 to 6.6.5.4.2-6:\nTable 6.6.5.4.2-4: Wide Area BS operating band unwanted emission limits for 1.4 MHz channel bandwidth (E-UTRA bands >1GHz) for Category A\n\nTable 6.6.5.4.2-5: Wide Area BS operating band unwanted emission limits for 3 MHz channel bandwidth (E-UTRA bands >1GHz) for Category A\n\nTable 6.6.5.4.2-6: Wide Area BS operating band unwanted emission limits for 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz channel bandwidth (E-UTRA bands >1GHz) for Category A\n\nFor Category B Operating band unwanted emissions, there are two options for the basic limits that may be applied regionally.

The mask is essential for ensuring that the system operates within legal and regulatory limits, as well as avoiding interference with other services. The mask is divided into different bands, each representing a specific range of frequencies. The upper and lower limits of each band are clearly marked, providing a visual representation of the system's operating spectrum. The mask also includes a legend that explains the symbols used, such as the solid and dashed lines, which indicate the allowed and restricted frequencies, respectively.

However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth can be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.\nThere is no spectrum emission mask requirement for a single RAT E-UTRA AAS BS.\n",

In some exceptional cases, requirements apply also closer than ΔfOBUE MHz from the downlink operating band; these cases are highlighted in the requirement tables in respective referenced UTRA, E-UTRA or MSR specifications. For operating bands supported by multi-band RIB each supported band including the ΔfOBUE around the band are excluded from the spurious emissions requirements.\nThe requirements applies for both single band RIBs and multi-band RIBs (except for frequencies at which exclusion bands or other multi-band provisions apply) and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's specification. Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power.\nFor operation in Region 2, where the FCC guidance for MIMO systems in [18] is applicable, the emissions limits are the same regardless of the number of transceiver units so the limits are equivalent to those for a single transceiver unit as specified in the as the corresponding applicable non-AAS BS per transmitter requirement specified in 3GPP TS 25.104 [2], 3GPP TS 25.105 [3], 3GPP TS 36.104 [4] or 3GPP TS 37.104 [5].

For a multi-band RIB, the exclusions and conditions in the Notes column of table 9.7.6.3.4.2-1 apply for each supported operating band.\nTable 9.7.6.3.4.2-1: UTRA AAS BS OTA Spurious emissions limits for AAS BS co-located with another BS\n\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this subclause, the co-location requirements in table 9.7.6.3.4.2-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a downlink operating band (see subclause 9.7.1). The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [12].\nNOTE 2:\tTable 9.7.6.3.4.2-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in subclause 9.7.1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tCo-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the same or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nThe minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA BS is the same as that defined for an MSR BS in subclause 9.7.6.2.1.1.\nThe TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in table 9.7.6.4.1.2-1\nTable 9.7.6.4.1.2-1: AAS BS OTA Spurious emissions limits, Category B\n\nThis requirement shall be applied for E-UTRA FDD operation in order to prevent the receivers of own or a different BS of the same band being desensitised by emissions from a OTA AAS BS.\nThe requirement is a co-location requirement. The power levels are specified at the co-location reference antenna output.\nThe power sum of any spurious emission is specified over all supported polarizations of the co-location reference antenna and shall not exceed the limits in table 9.7.6.4.2-1.\nTable 9.7.6.4.2-1: BS Spurious emissions limits for protection of the BS receiver\n\nThese requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating in frequency ranges other than the BS downlink operating band. The limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the same geographical area as the BS, or they may be set by local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an operating band. It is in some cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the present document is given in subclause 4.5.\nSome requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment (UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM/EDGE, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.\nAll additional spurious requirements are TRP unless otherwise stated.\nThe TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of table 9.7.6.4.3.2-1 for an AAS BS where requirements for co-existence with the system listed in the first column apply.

Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional requirements.\nNOTE 2:\tTable 9.7.6.2.3.2-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the frequency ranges in subclause 9.7.1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tFor the protection of DCS1800, UTRA Band III or E-UTRA Band 3 in China, the frequency ranges of the downlink and uplink protection requirements are 1805 – 1850 MHz and 1710 – 1755 MHz respectively.\nNOTE 4:\tTDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that are synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can transmit without additional co-existence requirements. For unsynchronized base stations (except in Band 46, or in Band 49), special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 6:\tFor Band 28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with Band 27 UL operating band.\nNOTE 7:\tFor Band 29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with UTRA Band XII or E-UTRA Band 12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 85 UL operating band.\nThe following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between ΔfOBUE below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band and ΔfOBUE above the highest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band.\nThe TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 9.7.6.4.3.2-2: AAS BS OTA Spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with PHS\n\nThe following requirement shall be applied to AAS BS operating in Bands 13 and 14 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 700 MHz public safety operations.

This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from ΔfOBUE below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to ΔfOBUE above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nThe TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 9.7.6.4.3.2-6: Additional AAS BS OTA Spurious emissions limits for Band 30\n\nThe following requirement may apply to AAS BS operating in Band 48 in certain regions. The TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 9.7.6.4.3.2-7: Additional AAS BS OTA Spurious emissions limits for Band 48\n\nIn addition to the requirements in subclauses 9.7.6.2.1, 9.7.6.2.2 and above in the present subclause, the AAS BS may have to comply with the applicable emission limits established by FCC Title 47 [15], when deployed in regions where those limits are applied, and under the conditions declared by the manufacturer.\nTable 9.7.6.4.3.2-8: Void\nThe following requirement shall be applied to AAS BS operating in Bands 13 and 14 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 700 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from ΔfOBUE below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to ΔfOBUE above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nThe TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 9.7.6.4.3.2-9: AAS BS OTA Spurious emissions limits for protection of 700 MHz public safety operations\n\nThe following requirement shall be applied to AAS BS operating in Band 26 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 800 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from ΔfOBUE below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to ΔfOBUE above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.\nThe TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed:\nTable 9.7.6.4.3.2-10: AAS BS OTA Spurious emissions limits for protection of 800 MHz public safety operations\n\nThe following requirement may apply to BS operating in Band 54 in certain regions, to be used together with other information about the site installation to verify the compliance.\nThe level of emissions in the 1541 – 1650 MHz band, measured in measurement bandwidth according to table 9.7.6.4.3.2-11 shall not exceed the maximum TRP limits indicated in the table.\nTable 9.7.6.4.3.2-11: Emissions levels for protection of the 1541-1650 MHz band\n\nNote:\tThe regional requirements specified in attachment to the FCC reference document, 0007135419,  are defined in terms of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The method outlined in annex B1 indicates how the limit in table 9.7.6.4.3.2-11 demonstrates compliance to the regional requirement.\n\nThese requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD E-UTRA BS and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.\nThe requirements assume with base stations of the same class.\nNOTE:\tFor co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on co-location with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.\nThe requirement is a co-location requirement. The power levels are specified at the co-location reference antenna output.\nThe power sum of any spurious emission is specified over all supported polarizations of the co-location reference antenna and shall not exceed the limits of table 9.7.6.4.4.2-1 for a AAS BS where requirements for co-location with a BS type listed in the first column apply, depending on the declared Base Station class. For a multi-band RIB , the exclusions and conditions in the notes column of table 9.7.6.4.4.2-1 apply for each supported operating band.\nTable 9.7.6.4.4.2-1: AAS BS OTA Spurious emissions limits for AAS BS co-located with another BS\n\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this subclause, the co-location requirements in table 9.7.6.4.4.2-1 do not apply for the ΔfOBUE frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a downlink operating band (see subclause 9.7.1). The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [12].\nNOTE 2:\tTable 9.7.6.4.4.2-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in subclause 9.7.1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tCo-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the same or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.\n",

Such requirements may be applied per antenna, per cell, or per base station. It shall be noted that the definition of BS or cell may differ between regulations. Where the regulator prescribes a method for EIRP calculation, that method supersedes the proposed assessment in this annex.\nThe regulations set an EIRP limit considering a passive antenna BS. Although the gain of passive antennas may vary somewhat, the gain variation is in the order of a few dBs. The instantaneous gain of an AAS BS may be much larger. However AAS unwanted emissions requirements are defined as TRP, since TRP impacts co-existence properties.\nIn order to relate the EIRP values in the specifications to TRP, a fixed assumption has been made on the gain of a typical passive BS antenna.\nThus, the maximum TRP can be estimated using the following formulas:\nTRP limit per antenna:\tPTRP, antenna = PEIRP - GAnt\nE-UTRA TRP limit per cell or per BS:\tPTRP =PTRP,antenna + 9dB\nUTRA TRP limit per cell or per BS:\tPTRP =PTRP,antenna + 6dB\nIt is noted that the AAS architecture assumes that a BS subject to OTA requirements will have at least 8 antennas.\nIn case the TRP requirement is set per polarisation, the summation shall be made per polarisation.\n\"PEIRP\" is the effective isotropic radiated power (or radiated power spectral density) set in the regulation (assuming a passive BS antenna) in dBm (or dBm/measurement BW).\n\"GAnt\" is the effective antenna gain, the antenna gain (dBi) is a fixed reference value of 17 dBi. Directivity value should be used in above equations, however with all antenna losses are assumed zero then we can use effective antenna gain.\n\n\n\n",
