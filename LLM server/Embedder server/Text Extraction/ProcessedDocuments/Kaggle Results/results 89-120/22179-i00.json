The MCPTT Service can be used for public safety applications and also for general commercial applications (e.g., utility companies and railways). The specifications contained within the present document can also form the basis for a non-mission critical Push To Talk service (called a PTT service).\nNote that further development of mission critical services beyond MCPTT (such as Mission Critical Video and Mission Critical Data) created an opportunity to re-use base functionality documented in the Stage 1 requirements for MCPTT. For example, the ability to communicate mission critical information to groups of users is a common need regardless of service type. Wherever originating MCPTT requirements were found to be in common with other mission critical services, those requirements were moved to a new Technical Specification (3GPP TS 22.280). Each requirement that was moved has been voided in this version of 3GPP TS 22.179, and an informative annex has been created at the end of this specification documenting the location of the originating 3GPP TS 22.179 requirement in 3GPP TS 22.280.\n",

                    "text_content": "A Push To Talk service provides an arbitrated method by which two or more users may engage in communication. Users may request permission to transmit (e.g., traditionally by means of a press of a button). The Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) service supports an enhanced PTT service, suitable for mission critical scenarios, based upon 3GPP system services. The requirements for Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) service defined within can also form the basis for a non-mission critical Push To Talk (PTT) service.\nThe MCPTT Service is intended to support communication between several users (a group call), where each user has the ability to gain access to the permission to talk in an arbitrated manner. However, the MCPTT Service also supports Private Calls between pairs of users. The MCPTT Service builds on the existing 3GPP transport communication mechanisms provided by the 3GPP architectures to establish, maintain, and terminate the actual communication path(s) among the users.\nThe MCPTT Service also builds upon service enablers: Group Communications System Enablers and Proximity Services. To the extent feasible, it is expected that the end user's experience to be similar regardless if the MCPTT Service is used under coverage of a 3GPP network or based on ProSe without network coverage. To clarify this intent, the requirements are grouped according to applicability to on-network use, off-network use, or both.\nThough the MCPTT Service primarily focuses on the use of the 3GPP system there might be users who access the MCPTT Service through non-3GPP access technology, dispatchers and administrators are examples of this. Dispatchers and administrators are special users who have particular admin and call management privileges which normal users might not have. In MCPTT dispatchers can use an MCPTT UE (i.e., 3GPP) or a non-3GPP access connection to the MCPTT Service based on a \"dispatcher and Administrator\" interface. Through this interface a user is able to access and manage the services related to on the network and those common to on the network and off the network.\nThe MCPTT Service allows users to request the permission to talk (transmit voice/audio) and provides a deterministic mechanism to arbitrate between requests that are in contention (i.e., Floor control). When multiple requests occur, the determination of which user's request is accepted and which users' requests are rejected or queued is based upon a number of characteristics (including the respective priorities of the users in contention). MCPTT Service provides a means for a user with higher priority (e.g., MCPTT Emergency condition) to override (interrupt) the current talker. MCPTT Service also supports a mechanism to limit the time a user talks (hold the floor) thus permitting users of the same or lower priority a chance to gain the floor.\nThe MCPTT Service provides the means for a user to monitor activity on a number of separate calls and enables the user to switch focus to a chosen call. An MCPTT Service user may join an already established MCPTT Group call (Late call entry). In addition the MCPTT Service provides the User ID of the current speaker(s) and user's Location determination features.\nThe users of an MCPTT Service may have more stringent expectations of performance than the users of a commercial PTT service.\nMCPTT is primarily targeting to provide a professional Push To Talk service to e.g., public safety, transport companies, utilities or industrial and nuclear plants. In addition to this a commercial PTT service for non-professional use (e.g., groups of people on holiday) may be delivered through an MCPTT system. Based on their operational model, the performance and MCPTT features in use vary per user organization, where functionality which is more mission critical specific (e.g., Ambient Listening and Imminent Peril Call) might not be available to commercial customers.\nMCPTT Users expect to communicate with other MCPTT Users as outlined above, however MCPTT Users also need to be able to communicate with non MCPTT Users using their MCPTT UEs for normal telephony services.\n",

                    "text_content": "NOTE:\tEven though this subclause is written from an organization specific perspective the text is illustrative for typical use of MCPTT Services by all MCPTT Users.\nPublic safety workers often operate in groups and perform different tasks during the day/week. Many tasks and operations are controlled, assisted and/or coordinated by a dispatcher.\nFor their communications public safety workers are organized in groups. People that are working together communicate in the same MCPTT Group, the group communication helping them to coordinate quickly.\nPeople with different tasks often communicate in separate MCPTT Groups.\nMany of the public safety tasks are routine tasks, that are handled by standard procedures and communication structures, using dedicated MCPTT Groups. Communication structures and MCPTT Groups are also prepared for the handling of large incidents and control of large events. Similarly there are MCPTT Groups and procedures for coordination with public safety workers from other organizations and/or other countries.\nThe standard procedures and communication structures help the public safety workers to do their work successfully. This results in a long list of (>100) MCPTT Groups available to a public safety worker, from which the correct one is selected depending on the task. To help the public safety worker to quickly find and select the correct MCPTT Group for the task, the MCPTT Groups in the radio are often structured in folders and/or accessible via key-shortcuts. In addition to pre-established MCPTT Groups that users select, there are also provisions in MCPTT systems to merge MCPTT Groups and to select on behalf of a user which group they should be using and for a dispatcher to push them onto it. The large number of MCPTT Groups provisioned on devices is helpful for the device to be able to operate on the network and off the network. However the ability to provision over the air is also seen as a very useful feature, as currently Land Mobile Radio devices often have to be locally re-programmed, rather than updated over the air.\n",

The figure 4.3.1, figure 4.3.2, and figure 4.3.3 indicate the high level flows, states and permissions associated with Group Calls and Private Calls. The diagrams apply to the on-network case and off-network case, as from a user perspective the service and concepts should appear similar on the network and off the network. From a technical perspective there might be differences between the on-network states and off-network states (e.g., off the network Affiliation might not require notifying an application server of a user's affiliation and there might also be other differences in the detail depending on the extent to which the off-network capabilities can match the on-network capabilities).\nIf an MCPTT User wants to communicate with an MCPTT Group they have to be allowed to access the MCPTT Group (i.e., be an MCPTT Group Member), they then have to affiliate and then can have an MCPTT Group as their Selected MCPTT Group. If an MCPTT User is only affiliated to a group this is so that they can receive from the group, however if an MCPTT User has a Selected MCPTT Group this is their group for transmitting on. The differences in states enable an MCPTT User to receive from multiple MCPTT Groups, but specify which MCPTT Group they would like to transmit on.\n\nThe given telecommunication figure illustrates a conceptual model of a wireless communication system, focusing on the signal transmission and reception process.

The diagram is not exhaustive and does not include all the different scenarios.\nFigure 4.3.3: MCPTT User state diagram- receive only for a particular MCPTT Group\nIt is possible for an MCPTT User to be affiliated with one or more MCPTT Groups. Normally, while in operation, an MCPTT User informs the MCPTT Service about which MCPTT Groups he would like to be affiliated to. These affiliations remain in effect until the MCPTT User removes them, or changes them, or signs out of the service. Some MCPTT Users have permanent affiliations to certain MCPTT Groups and those affiliations are set up implicitly (i.e., automatically) when operating on the network. For those users, the MCPTT Group affiliation starts when the MCPTT Service successfully signs in the user and ends when the MCPTT User's explicit or implicit (e.g., due to inactivity or the turning off of all its devices) request to sign out of the MCPTT Service is acknowledged.\nEvery time a PTT request is granted a user can start an MCPTT transmission or \"talk burst\". An MCPTT Group Call consists of one or more MCPTT transmissions. Whether two consecutive transmissions from same or different users are part of the same call, or the second transmission starts a new call, depends on the configurable maximum length of the inactivity period between the consecutive MCPTT transmissions. This inactivity period can be seen as a Hang Time that starts at the end of the preceding transmission. While this timer is running, the resources associated with the call stay assigned to the call (except in case of pre-emption), which could reduce the latency of future floor requests for this group versus groups who are not involved in a call. When a new transmission starts during the inactivity period, the timer is stopped, reset and restarted again at the end of that transmission.\nThe MCPTT Service recognizes a number of \"special\" group calls including: Broadcast Group Call, Emergency Group Call and Imminent Peril group call.\nA Broadcast Group Call can be seen as a special group call with only one MCPTT transmission.\nWhile the In-progress Emergency state or In-progress Imminent Peril state is active, the inactivity period is conceptually set to infinity; i.e., the resources assigned to calls during these states are never released (except in case of pre-emption). An MCPTT Emergency Group Call or an Imminent Peril group call can be seen as having an unspecified number of transmissions: essentially, all the transmissions to a group during In-progress Emergency state or In-progress Imminent Peril are part of the same MCPTT Group Call.\nConditions on starting (\"commencement\") and continuing an MCPTT call can be established. Usually at least the call initiator (but also other users) are kept informed via notifications of the starting, stopping, queuing, etc., of a call.\nIn general, commencement conditions are related to the presence on the call (i.e., participation) of certain members of the group, and/or of a minimum number of members, as well as on the availability of resources (e.g., GBR bearers) of proper ARP. If the commencement conditions are not met, the call does not start (it can be queued or rejected). Normally, commencement conditions are not checked for individual transmission within a call.\nContinuation conditions are similar (though not required to be identical) to commencement conditions and get re-evaluated when pre-emption, degradation of priority, motion out of communication range, de-selection of the group or de-affiliation (explicit or implicit) occur. If the continuation conditions are not met, the call stops.\n",

Conceptually, requests are accompanied by priority information that is used in the arbitration, in case of contention; see also subclause 4.6 for a brief explanation and examples on how priority processing is modelled.\nUpon arrival, a request is immediately granted, denied, or queued.\nIf queued, a request can be dropped due to queue overflow (i.e., too many items queued) or can be cancelled by an authorized user, who is usually the initiator of the request. Either way, the net result is that the request is denied.\nWhen a request denial is communicated, the request may be re-requested either manually by user action or automatically. In the automatic case, while the request remains denied, it may be automatically repeated a configurable number of times where a minimum time interval between re-transmissions may also be applied.\nThere are many \"queuing disciplines\" possible that govern the placement of items in a queue and their subsequent removal from the queue: e.g., FIFO, priority order. Assuming that the queuing discipline chosen places the highest priority requests towards the top of the queue, the granted request is either, depending on the design and configuration, the front-most entry in the queue or the first entry counting from the top that can be satisfied by the available resources. For example, if the topmost entry in the queue is awaiting for ten GBR bearers of given characteristics to become available and the second entry in the queue is waiting for seven GBR bearers to become available, and at some point in time eight GBR bearers become available, then it is possible that the second request is granted ahead of the first one, which continues to wait. Alternatively, neither the first request nor the second request is granted and the wait continues until at least ten GBR bearers become available, at which time the first request is granted while the second request continues to wait.\n",

The MCPTT User Profile contains important information related to the MCPTT User receiving the MCPTT Service, including the MCPTT User identity, which is globally unique and independent of the mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) assigned by a 3GPP network operator. Part of the content of the MCPTT User Profile (e.g., containing some display preferences, some UE audio settings, some address books) can be set/modified/updated by the MCPTT User, but significant portions might be set/modified/updated only by authorized persons. The MCPTT User Profile is stored permanently in database(s) associated with the infrastructure providing the MCPTT Service. Relevant parts of the profile might be downloaded to and cached temporarily or permanently on certain MCPTT UEs. When stored on an MCPTT UE, the MCPTT User Profile associated with an MCPTT User might be confidentiality and integrity protected, with the information available only to a trusted application client associated to the MCPTT User, upon authentication. The MCPTT User Profile information can be synchronized automatically or on demand between the cache on the MCPTT UE and the main copy held in the database(s) of the MCPTT Service infrastructure. The MCPTT User Profile is part of the MCPTT application service domain and forms the basis of MCPTT application layer security and identifies an MCPTT User to the MCPTT Service.\nEach MCPTT User has at least one MCPTT User Profile, and possibly several. Typically, one of the MCPTT User Profiles is designated as the default MCPTT User Profile, to be used unless an MCPTT User Profile is explicitly selected. In general, a user profile is associated with a specific device, with a specific mode of operation (i.e., on the network or off the network) and/or with a specific situation (e.g., user being off-duty, in a certain city, or playing a certain role). When an MCPTT User Profile is synchronized between the infrastructure and an MCPTT device, information could be downloaded to the device and updated, as necessary. Subsequently and subject to permissions, the MCPTT User might choose a different associated MCPTT User Profile to be downloaded and stored on the device. Only one MCPTT User Profile is active at a time. Authorized users are allowed to create, delete and alter MCPTT User Profiles for an MCPTT User and/or pre-stored MCPTT User Profiles.\nThe MCPTT Service supports MCPTT UEs which connect to the MCPTT Service. The capabilities of an MCPTT UE are specified in the present document. The MCPTT Application that is resident on the MCPTT UE establishes this connection, employing application layer security in its connection to the MCPTT Service.

A shareable MCPTT UE can be used by user who can gain access to the MCPTT client application stored on it and can become an authenticated MCPTT User. A shareable MCPTT UE can serve only one MCPTT User at a time. An MCPTT User who signs into a shareable MCPTT UE that is already in-use causes the sign-off of the previous MCPTT User.\nAn MCPTT User can simultaneously have several active MCPTT UEs, which, from an MCPTT Service point of view, are addressable individually and/or collectively within the context of their association to the MCPTT User.\nThe conceptual model for a gateway UE is that of a UE capable of providing service to an MCPTT User employing a non-3GPP device. A gateway UE is usable simultaneously by multiple MCPTT Users. Unlike a shareable MCPTT UE, if a new person enters his valid credentials towards signing in the MCPTT Service, his successful signing in and becoming an MCPTT User does not affect the initial MCPTT Users already served by the gateway UE.\nA gateway UE is typically installed in a vehicle (e.g., a police car, fire truck) and has wired and/or wireless connections to various devices in use by the MCPTT Users.\nA gateway UE differs functionally from a ProSe relay node. In the ProSe paradigm, the relay node and the devices served by it are all (ProSe enabled) 3GPP UEs, and are \"visible\" to the 3GPP system as UEs.

This model, effective and relatively straightforward for non-public safety users, falls short when it comes to the needs of the public safety applications.\nMCPTT Priority and QoS is situational. The MCPTT Service is intended to provide a real-time priority and QoS experience for MCPTT calls, as public safety users have significant dynamic operational conditions that determine their priority. For example, the type of incident a responder is serving or the responder's overall shift role needs to strongly influence a user's ability to obtain resources from the 3GPP system.\nAnother feature of a mission critical service is transparency of interactions between the users and the system. A first responder that needs to change the QoS of his communications is not to be distracted from his mission due to complicated UE behaviours or service interactions. Instead, the service acts in an anticipatory and adaptive manner to provide the proper quality of experience to the user, automatically, or with simple and minimal interaction.\nThe mission critical service is also expected to provide the ability to interface with public safety systems (e.g., Computer Aided Dispatch) in order to determine the user's state (e.g., incident severity), environment and conditions and to affect the most appropriate priority and QoS experience for the user.\nThe MCPTT Priority handling for on-network use for MCPTT Calls is conceptually modelled as shown in figure 4.6.1.1. The conceptual model identifies three areas of prioritization: prioritization between and within calls, inter-system prioritization, and prioritization at the transport layer (3GPP system and UE). At the Application Layer a generic, network side, functional entity, \"MCPTT Priority and QoS Control\", processes with each request static, preconfigured information about users and groups participating in MCPTT, as well as dynamic (or situational) information about them. Based on the results of this processing, the \"MCPTT Priority and QoS Control\" provides information to and directs interactions with other functional entities, systems, or layers to ensure, to the extent possible, that from a quality of experience point of view, calls and transmissions are handled properly in accordance to established policy rules.\nError! Objects cannot be created from editing field codes.\nFigure 4.6.1-1: A conceptual on-network MCPTT priority model\nThe User Static Attributes include information categorizing the user, possibly by several criteria (e.g., first responder, second responder, supervisor, dispatcher, administrator), as well as jurisdictional boundaries and possibly a preconfigured system-wide individual priority level.\nThe Group Static Attributes include information about the nature/type of the group and the owning organization(s), the jurisdictional boundaries for transmitters and receivers within the group, the normal hours of operation for the group, pre-emption dispositions relative to other groups, and the default minimum priority of the group, i.e., the minimum priority characteristics that are provided to all the Participants in a group call associated with this group, regardless of their individual priority characteristics.\nThe User Dynamic Attributes include the user/Participant's operational status (e.g., on/off duty), his location, the type of incident (e.g., MCPTT Emergency or Imminent Peril) he might be involved in and whether or not he initiated it, whether or not he is individually involved in a formally managed incident and if yes, the boundaries of the incident area, the incident severity and his assigned role in the resolution of the incident.\nThe Group Dynamic Attributes include the type of incident (e.g., MCPTT Emergency or Imminent Peril), if any, the group is currently handling and in case of involvement in a formally managed incident the boundaries of the incident area and the incident severity.\n",

The UEs are identified at the transport or network layer, but in some situations they might also be identified by the MCPTT Service. Each identifiable entity is distinct from all others and has an identifier (ID) associated to it, unique within a proximate identity domain. Those domains correspond to identifiable entities and can be nested within other domains in a multi-level hierarchical fashion. For example an MCPTT User might have an identifier unique within the domain corresponding to a Mission Critical Organization. The top-down concatenation of identifiers can generate unique identifiers within larger contexts, eventually leading to the identifiers being globally unique.\nEach identifier can be associated with one or more aliases, which can be used for displaying and selection purposes. Some aliases are shortened equivalents of the identifier used for efficient signalling and are not intended for human interactions. At a minimum, each entity has one alias (default) which is the alphanumeric representation of its identifier. Most entities have a main alias, which is the entity's name. Some aliases can be pictures, icons or other graphic representations. It is up to the implementation to decide if aliases have to be unique and if so, within which domain. Finally, some aliases are public, can be created/deleted only by authorized persons and are available to the MCPTT Service, while other aliases are private, can be created/deleted by their owners and might be residing only on certain UEs or be part of some private address books.\nIt is possible in principle for User IDs, Group IDs, as well as for aliases, to be defined system wide with certain values, but have different values for each application: e.g., the system wide User ID might be different from the MCPTT User ID and different from the video User ID for the same user. However, this type of separation might not be beneficial, and in practice only one identifier is likely to be used.\nFor simplicity, the term \"User ID\" is employed to identify an MCPTT User, without distinction of whether it is an identifier or an alias.\n",

The information gained by monitoring might be useful for the dispatcher to determine any actions to take or be useful later if the MCPTT User is deployed to provide additional support for that event. The MCPTT User might be assigned to support the activities of more than one MCPTT Group on the same shift. This means that the MCPTT User receives multiple MCPTT Groups.\nAn MCPTT User with limited speaker resources (e.g., a handheld UE) might find that playing out concurrent received audio from multiple active MCPTT Groups becomes confusing and could also cause undesired voice distortion for the receiving user. During periods of time when the MCPTT User is receiving audio from multiple MCPTT Groups, which MCPTT Group's audio is presented to the MCPTT User is determined by the MCPTT User's choice, the priority associated with the talker of the Selected MCPTT Group(s), other considerations or combinations of these. The MCPTT UE is aware of all the active groups to which the MCPTT User has affiliated or selected and the identity of the other active receiving groups is available for display on the MCPTT UE. When the receive activity from the Selected MCPTT Group stops, the MCPTT UE might present the audio from the next group per the MCPTT User's choice or by other means.\nIf none of the multiple groups to which the MCPTT User has affiliated or selected is active, the MCPTT UE would continue to monitor for activity by any of the multiple affiliated or Selected MCPTT Groups. Monitoring for activity of multiple MCPTT Groups is also known as scanning and the list of the multiple groups is also known as a scan list.\n",

Private Calls can use Floor control or not (i.e., be full voice duplex calls between users), though Private Calls without Floor control are only supported on the network.\nTwo commencement modes of Private Calls are supported: Manual Commencement Private Call and Automatic Commencement Private Call. The two commencement modes can be used in conjunction with Private Calls with/without Floor control.\nManual Commencement Private Calls mimic a telephone conversation where the called party receives a notification that they are being requested to join a Private Call, and the called party may accept, reject, or ignore the call request. Once the call setup is accepted, the Private Call is established and both Participants may communicate with each other.\nAutomatic Commencement Private Calls mimic the immediate setup and voice propagation of Group Call operation between two users where the calling party initiates an Automatic Commencement Private Call to another user and sends audio without any additional call setup delay beyond Group Calls. If available and able to accept the Private Call from the calling party, the called party immediately joins the Private Call and processes the calling party's audio.\n",

                            "text_content": "MCPTT Emergency Group Call and MCPTT Imminent Peril group call are MCPTT Group Calls that provide the MCPTT User elevated priority towards obtaining resources of the MCPTT system. The MCPTT Emergency Private Call similarly provides elevated priority to resources of the MCPTT system. The MCPTT Emergency Alert provides a notification of an MCPTT Emergency situation from an MCPTT UE, regardless if the user is signed in with the MCPTT Service or not.\nThe MCPTT Emergency Alert is initiated from an MCPTT UE to inform the MCPTT Service of the user's immediate need of assistance due to the user's personal, life-threatening situation. If the user is not properly authenticated, he is treated as a temporary MCPTT User with limited permissions. The user initiates this notification by actuating a user interface on the MCPTT UE. The notification to the MCPTT Service includes the MCPTT User's ID, potentially an MCPTT Group ID, the user's Mission Critical Organization name and the most current location available for the user's MCPTT UE.\nThe user profile/group configuration determines which MCPTT Group ID is used, if any. If the user profile indicates that a dedicated (i.e., not used for everyday traffic) MCPTT Emergency Group is to be used, then the MCPTT Emergency call traffic moves to a different group. MCPTT Users that support MCPTT Emergency situations are required to monitor the dedicated MCPTT Emergency Group(s) for call activity. If the user profile indicates that the selected (i.e., currently active) MCPTT Group is to be used, then its Group ID is used, unless no group is selected.\nAfter the MCPTT User has initiated an MCPTT Emergency Alert, MCPTT Emergency Private Call or MCPTT Emergency Group Call, the MCPTT User is considered to be in the MCPTT Emergency State. The user remains in the MCPTT Emergency State until the MCPTT User cancels the MCPTT Emergency State.\nAn MCPTT Group Call started by an MCPTT User while in the MCPTT Emergency State or previously started but followed by an MCPTT Emergency Alert becomes an MCPTT Emergency Group Call. The MCPTT Group ID used for the MCPTT Emergency Group Call is the same MCPTT Group ID included in the MCPTT Emergency Alert. An MCPTT User or dispatcher might initiate an MCPTT Emergency Group Call without an MCPTT Emergency Alert. The start of an MCPTT Emergency Group Call starts an In-progress Emergency condition for the MCPTT Group. Any subsequent MCPTT Group Call made by any MCPTT Group Member of an MCPTT Group which has an In-progress Emergency is treated as an MCPTT Emergency Group Call. MCPTT Emergency Group priority is removed when the In-progress Emergency for the group is cancelled.\nAn MCPTT Private Call started by an MCPTT User while in the MCPTT Emergency State becomes an MCPTT Emergency Private Call.\nMCPTT Imminent Peril group call is differentiated from MCPTT Emergency Group Call based on for whom the assistance is required. The MCPTT Emergency Group Call is initiated by an MCPTT User for assistance for the MCPTT Emergency condition involving that user. The MCPTT Imminent Peril group call is initiated by an MCPTT User for assistance to other MCPTT Users or persons of the general public observed to be in trouble and may soon need assistance.\nThere is no MCPTT Imminent Peril Alert and no MCPTT Imminent Peril State for MCPTT Users. The granting of an MCPTT Imminent Peril group call starts an In-progress Imminent Peril condition for the MCPTT Group. Any subsequent MCPTT Group Call made by any MCPTT Group Member of an MCPTT Group which has an In-progress Imminent Peril condition is treated as an MCPTT Imminent Peril group call. MCPTT Imminent Peril Group priority is removed when the In-progress Imminent Peril for the group is cancelled.\n",

of that MCPTT Group.\n[R-6.2.1-001a] The MCPTT Service shall be capable of allowing an MCPTT Group Call setup request to proceed only if a minimum number of MCPTT Group Members are currently affiliated.\n[R-6.2.1-001b] The MCPTT Service shall be capable of allowing an MCPTT Group Call setup request to proceed only if specific MCPTT Group Member(s) are currently affiliated.\n[R-6.2.1-002] An MCPTT User currently affiliated to an MCPTT Group shall acknowledge receipt of an MCPTT Group call setup request, if requested to do so by the MCPTT Service.\n[R-6.2.1-003] The MCPTT User's acknowledgement may require direct interaction of the MCPTT UE with the human user, or may be automatically executed by the MCPTT UE, in accordance with policy established by an MCPTT Administrator.\n[R-6.2.1-004] The MCPTT Service shall be capable of requiring that a minimum number of Affiliated MCPTT Group Members acknowledges receipt of the MCPTT Group call setup request before the audio transmission proceeds.\n[R-6.2.1-005] The MCPTT Service shall be capable of requiring that specific MCPTT Users acknowledge receipt of the MCPTT Group call setup request before the audio transmission proceeds, regardless of the affiliation state of those users.\nNOTE 1:\tIn this case the MCPTT Service affiliates the specific MCPTT Users who are not currently affiliated to the target MCPTT Group and then returns them to their previous affiliation state when the transmission ends.\n[R-6.2.1-006] The MCPTT Service shall be capable of requiring that all MCPTT Users that are both affiliated to the MCPTT Group and in a given geographical area acknowledge receipt of an MCPTT Group call setup request before the audio transmission proceeds.\n[R-6.2.1-007] The MCPTT Service shall provide a mechanism for an MCPTT Administrator to determine the subset of Affiliated MCPTT Group Members that shall acknowledge receipt of the MCPTT Group call setup request before the audio transmission proceeds.\nNOTE 2:\tIn the following requirements, the term, \"MCPTT Group Call setup request requires acknowledgement\" is used when one or more of the acknowledgement conditions defined above (i.e., [R-6.2.1-004], [R-6.2.1-005], [R-6.2.1-006], and/or [R-6.2.1-007]) applies.\n[R-6.2.1-008] If an MCPTT Group Call setup request requires acknowledgement from Affiliated MCPTT Group Members, and the required MCPTT Group Members do not acknowledge the call setup within a configured time (the \"acknowledged call setup timeout\"), the MCPTT Service may proceed with the call and then may notify the initiating MCPTT User that the acknowledgements did not include all required members.\n[R-6.2.1-009] If an MCPTT Group Call setup request requires acknowledgement from Affiliated MCPTT Group Members, and the required MCPTT Group Members do not acknowledge the call setup within a configured time, the MCPTT Service may abandon the call and then may notify the initiating MCPTT User that the acknowledgements did not include all required members.\n[R-6.2.1-010] If an MCPTT Group Call setup request requires acknowledgement from Affiliated MCPTT Group Members, the initiating MCPTT User shall at any time have the option of allowing the call to proceed regardless of the state of the acknowledgements (i.e., to \"convert\" the call to an unacknowledged call).\n[R-6.2.1-010a] If an MCPTT Group Call setup request requires acknowledgement from Affiliated MCPTT Group Members, and the required MCPTT Group Members did not acknowledge the call setup within a configured time, the MCPPT Service shall be able to provide the list of MCPTT Group Members who did not acknowledge the call to the initiating MCPTT User.\n[R-6.2.1-011] If an MCPTT Group Call setup request requires acknowledgement from Affiliated MCPTT Group Members, the acknowledged call setup timeout shall be established by an MCPTT Administrator.\n[R-6.2.1-012] If an MCPTT Group Call setup request requires acknowledgement from Affiliated MCPTT Group Members, the behaviour in response to the expiration of the acknowledged call setup timeout shall be established by an MCPTT Administrator.\n[R-6.2.1-013] If an MCPTT Group Call setup request requires acknowledgement from Affiliated MCPTT Group Members, the MCPTT Service shall support an indefinite (i.e., infinite) call setup timeout.\n[R-6.2.1-014] If the MCPTT Service has knowledge that some affiliated members of a group can not be Participants in an unacknowledged MCPTT Group Call, the MCPTT Service shall provide an indication to the requester that the call is proceeding without all affiliated members, and shall provide the list of the missing members based on policy established by the MCPTT Administrator.\n[R-6.2.1-015] If MCPTT User(s) are excluded from an MCPTT call as there is insufficient capacity to support their participation the MCPTT Service shall ensure that the MCPTT User(s) receive a notification that they have been excluded from the call for reasons of lack of capacity.\n",

transmit, an MCPTT User that is not allowed to transmit shall be given an indication that the permission to transmit was rejected or queued.\n[R-6.2.3.2-009] The MCPTT Service shall provide an indication to receiving Participants that the transmitting Participant is starting to transmit.\n[R-6.2.3.2-010] The MCPTT Service shall provide a mechanism for an MCPTT Participant to remove its MCPTT Request from the Floor control queue.\n[R-6.2.3.2-011] The MCPTT Service shall provide a mechanism for removal (i.e., request accepted, request denied, or expiration of a timer) of an MCPTT Request from the Floor control queue.\n[R-6.2.3.2-012] The MCPTT Service shall provide a mechanism for the MCPTT Administrator to configure the parameter(s) of the Floor control queue for an MCPTT Group (i.e., timer).\n[R-6.2.3.3.1-001] The MCPTT Service shall enable MCPTT Administrators to create a priority hierarchy for determining what Participants, Participant types, and urgent transmission types shall be granted a request to override an active MCPTT transmission.\n[R-6.2.3.3.1-002] The MCPTT Service shall enable an MCPTT Administrator to configure which MCPTT Group transmission a Participant(s) receives, overriding and/or overridden for cases where an authorized Participant overrides an MCPTT transmission.\n[R-6.2.3.3.1-003] The MCPTT Service shall enable the MCPTT Administrator to configure the MCPTT Group to allow only the overriding Participant to transmit or to allow both the overriding and overridden Participant to transmit.\n[R-6.2.3.3.1-004] The MCPTT Service shall provide a mechanism for an MCPTT Administrator to configure MCPTT Private Calls (with Floor control) to allow only the overriding Participant to transmit or to allow both the overriding and overridden Participant to transmit.\n[R-6.2.3.3.1-005] The priority hierarchy used for granting a request to override an active MCPTT transmission shall contain at least four (4) levels.\n[R-6.2.3.3.1-006] The transmitting Participant shall be determined by the relative Floor control priorities of the Participants and Call type based on priority (e.g MCPTT Emergency).\n[R-6.2.3.3.1-007] The MCPTT Service shall provide a mechanism for Participants, to override an active MCPTT transmission of a transmitting Participant when the priority level of the overriding Participant or Call type based on priority (e.g MCPTT Emergency) are ranked higher than the priority level of the transmitting Participant or Call type based on priority.\n[R-6.2.3.3.1-008] If an authorized Participant overrides an MCPTT transmission, the MCPTT Service shall provide a means of notifying the overridden Participant(s) that the transmission has been overridden.\n[R-6.2.3.3.2-001] If the MCPTT Group has been configured to only allow the overriding transmitting Participant, the MCPTT Service shall revoke the transmit permission of the overridden transmitting Participant.\n[R-6.2.3.3.3-001] If the MCPTT Group has been configured to allow both overriding and overridden transmitting Participants, authorized receiving Participants shall be enabled to listen to both the overriding and overridden Participant transmissions, dependent on configuration.\n[R-6.2.3.3.3-002] The MCPTT Service shall allow successive overrides of an MCPTT Group Call when the request to override is made by an MCPTT User having a higher Floor control priority than the currently transmitting Participants.\n[R-6.2.3.3.3-003] In the case of successive overrides, the MCPTT Service shall enable only two transmissions, one overriding transmission, from the highest priority MCPTT User, and one overridden transmission, chosen from among the two overridden Participants based upon configured rule(s). (i.e., this could be based simply on priority of user, it could be based on a policy that an overridden MCPTT Emergency transmission shall remain as the overridden transmission or a rule could be established that the MCPTT system shall not allow two dispatchers to be both the overriding and overridden transmitters.).\n[R-6.2.3.4-001] The MCPTT Service shall enable an authorized MCPTT User to terminate the permission to transmit of a transmitting Participant at any time.\n[R-6.2.3.4-002] A transmitting Participant shall be able to indicate to the MCPTT Service that the Participant no longer wants to transmit.\nNOTE:\tIn this case audio stops being transmitted to the receiver Participant(s) until an authorized Participant sends a subsequent request for permission to transmit.\n[R-6.2.3.4-003] The MCPTT Service shall provide an indication to receiving Participants that the transmitting Participant has finished transmitting.\n[R-6.2.3.5-001] The MCPTT Service shall enable an MCPTT Administrator to configure the limit for the length of time that a Participant transmits from a single request to transmit.\n[R-6.2.3.5-002] The Floor control functionality shall have a configurable limit for the length of time that a Participant transmits from a single request to transmit.\n[R-6.2.3.5-003] The Floor control functionality shall provide an indication to the transmitting Participant that the Participant is within a configurable amount of time before his transmit time limit is reached.\n[R-6.2.3.5-004] The Floor control functionality shall provide an indication to the transmitting Participant that the Participant's transmit time limit has been reached.\n[R-6.2.3.5-005] The Floor control functionality shall remove the permission to transmit from the transmitting Participant when the Participant's transmit time limit has been reached.\nThe audio cut-in feature applies to specially designated MCPTT Groups and results in Floor control for that group allowing any participant within the MCPTT Group to interrupt any other participant. In particular the audio cut-in feature means that the last Participant to request the floor is assigned the floor immediately and there is only ever one talker on the call at a particular point in time. Audio cut-in is often used for teams escorting VIPs where timeliness is essential to allow teams to react as quickly as possible.\nOther than the difference in floor control logic, the MCPTT Groups configured to support audio cut-in behave in the same way as other MCPTT Groups with group management, affiliation, selection of a group, requesting the floor, the notifications received related to Floor control etc working in the same way.\n[R-6.2.3.6.2-001] The MCPTT Group shall be configurable to allow audio cut-in.\nNOTE 1:\tMCPTT Groups configured for audio cut-in behave in the same way as MCPTT Groups not configured for audio cut-in in all other respects other than the Floor control logic described in this sub-clause.\n[R-6.2.3.6.2-002] When an MCPTT Group has been configured to support audio cut-in, the Floor control functionality shall give the floor to the MCPTT Group Member that has selected that MCPTT Group and made the most recent request to transmit in that MCPTT Group.\nNOTE 2:\tRequests to transmit that are received simultaneously will be addressed by manufacturer implementation.\n[R-6.2.3.6.2-003] When an MCPTT Group has been configured to support audio cut-in the Floor control functionality shall restrict the number of talkers in the group to one.\n[R-6.2.3.6.2-004] When an MCPTT Group has been designated to support audio cut-in the MCPTT Group shall not support any form of floor control queuing and associated functionality.\n[R-6.2.3.6.2-005] When the current talker is interrupted by a request to transmit on an MCPTT Group supporting audio cut-in, the talk request of the interrupted talker shall end.\nNOTE 3:\tThe interrupted talker must make a new request to transmit in order to transmit again.\n[R-6.2.3.6.2-006] Void\n[R-6.2.3.6.2-007] Void\n[R-6.2.3.6.3-001] An authorized Participant shall be able to request to transmit to an MCPTT Group configured to support audio cut-in.\n[R-6.2.3.6.3-002] At call setup the MCPTT Service shall provide a notification, for example audio and/or visual, to the MCPTT Group Member attempting to transmit that there are no other Group Members who have affiliated to the MCPTT Group configured to support audio cut-in.\n[R-6.2.3.6.3-003] Following an MCPTT Request for permission to transmit on the Selected MCPTT Group configured to support audio cut-in, the Affiliated MCPTT Group Member that made and was granted the request shall be given an indication of being allowed to transmit.\n[R-6.2.3.6.3-004] The MCPTT Service shall provide an indication to receiving Participants that the transmitting Participant is starting to transmit on a group configured for audio cut-in.\n[R-6.2.3.6.4-001] The MCPTT Service shall enable an authorized MCPTT User to terminate the permission to transmit of a transmitting Participant at any time on a group configured for audio cut-in.\n[R-6.2.3.6.4-002] A transmitting Participant shall be able to indicate to the MCPTT Service that the Participant no longer wants to transmit on a group configured for audio cut-in.\nNOTE:\tIn this case audio stops being transmitted to the receiver Participant(s) until an authorized Participant sends a subsequent request for permission to transmit.\n[R-6.2.3.6.4-003] The MCPTT Service shall provide an indication to receiving Participants that the transmitting Participant has finished transmitting on a group configured for audio cut-in.\n[R-6.2.3.6.5-001] The MCPTT Service shall enable an MCPTT Administrator to configure the limit for the length of time that a Participant transmits from a single request to transmit on a group configured for audio cut-in.\n[R-6.2.3.6.5-002] The Floor control functionality for a group configured for audio cut-in shall have a configurable limit for the length of time that a Participant transmits from a single request to transmit.\n[R-6.2.3.6.5-003] The Floor control functionality for a group configured for audio cut-in shall provide an indication to the transmitting Participant that the Participant is within a configurable amount of time before his transmit time limit is reached.\n[R-6.2.3.6.5-004] The Floor control functionality for a group configured for audio cut-in shall provide an indication to the transmitting Participant that the Participant's transmit time limit has been reached.\n[R-6.2.3.6.5-005] The Floor control functionality for a group configured for audio cut-in shall remove the permission to transmit from the transmitting Participant when the Participant's transmit time limit has been reached.\nThe multi-talker control applies to designated MCPTT Groups and results in allowing several Participants talking simultaneously within the MCPTT Group. For example, Multi-talker control is used by railway communication e.g. during shunting operation.\nExcept for Floor control as specified in clauses 6.2.3.1, 6.2.3.2, 6.2.3.3 and 6.2.3.6 all other requirements specified in 6.2.3 floor control are applicable to MCPTT Groups configured to support multi-talker control\nWhen an MCPTT Group is configured for multi-talker control, the requirements listed below apply.\n[R-6.2.3.7.2-001] An MCPTT Group shall be configurable to allow multi-talker control.\n[R-6.2.3.7.2-002] The MCPTT Service shall provide a mechanism for multiple MCPTT Users to talk simultaneously in an MCPTT Group configured for multi-talker control.\n[R-6.2.3.7.2-003] The MCPTT Service shall determine which Participant(s) are allowed to transmit to all other Participant(s) in an MCPTT Group configured for multi-talker control.\n[R-6.2.3.7.2-004] The MCPTT Service shall support all Participant(s) to receive audio from all other Participant(s) that are transmitting in an MCPTT Group configured for multi-talker control.\n[R-6.2.3.7.2-005] The MCPTT Service shall provide a mechanism for the MCPTT Administrator to configure the maximum number of simultaneous talkers in an MCPTT Group configured for multi-talker control.\n[R-6.2.3.7.2-006] The MCPTT Service shall allow an authorized MCPTT User to change the maximum number of simultaneous talkers at any time during a group call in an MCPTT Group configured for multi-talker control.\n[R-6.2.3.7.3-001] The MCPTT Service shall enable authorized Participants to request to transmit to an MCPTT Group configured for multi-talker control.\n[R-6.2.3.7.3-002] At call setup the MCPTT Service shall provide a notification, for example audio and/or visual, to the MCPTT Group Member attempting to transmit that there are no other Group Members who have affiliated to the MCPTT Group configured for multi-talker control.\n[R-6.2.3.7.3-003] The MCPTT Service shall determine the transmitting Participant(s) when there are simultaneous requests for permission to transmit within the same call for an MCPTT Group configured for multi-talker control.\n[R-6.2.3.7.3-004] Following an MCPTT Request for permission to transmit on the Selected MCPTT Group configured for multi-talker control the MCPTT Service shall provide an Affiliated MCPTT Group Member that made and was granted the request an indication of being allowed to transmit.\n6.2.3.7.4.1\tGeneral aspects\n[R-6.2.3.7.4.1-001] If the number of MCPTT Users requesting the permission to talk exceeds the maximum number of simultaneous talkers in an MCPTT Group configured for multi-talker control, the MCPTT Service shall apply the override mechanism.\n[R-6.2.3.7.4.1-002] The MCPTT Service shall enable MCPTT Administrators to create a priority hierarchy for determining what Participants, Participant types, and urgent transmission types shall be granted a request to override an active MCPTT transmission on an MCPTT Group configured for multi-talker control.\n\n[R-6.2.3.7.4.1-003] The priority hierarchy used for granting a request to override an active MCPTT transmission on a group configured for multi-talker control shall contain at least four (4) levels.\n[R-6.2.3.7.4.1-004] The transmitting Participant onan MCPTT Group a group configured for multi-talker control shall be determined by the relative priorities of the Participants and Call type based on priority (e.g MCPTT Emergency).\n[R-6.2.3.7.4.1-005] Transmission requests of Participants with insufficient relative priority shall be rejected.\n[R-6.2.3.7.4.1-006] The MCPTT Service shall provide a mechanism for Participants, to override an active MCPTT transmission of a transmitting Participant when the priority level of the overriding Participant or Call type based on priority (e.g MCPTT Emergency) are ranked higher than the priority level of the transmitting Participant or Call type based on priority for an MCPTT Group configured for multi-talker control.\n[R-6.2.3.7.4.1-007] If an authorized Participant overrides an MCPTT transmission, the MCPTT Service shall provide a means of notifying the overridden Participant(s) that the transmission has been overridden for an MCPTT Group configured for multi-talker control.\n[R-6.2.3.7.4.1-008] The MCPTT Service shall revoke the transmit permission of the overridden transmitting Participant on an MCPTT Group configured for multi-talker control.\n",

                            "text_content": "For MCPTT Users, one of the most important performance criteria is the MCPTT Access time (KPI 1). The MCPTT Access time is defined as the time between when an MCPTT User request to speak (normally by pressing the MCPTT control on the MCPTT UE) and when this user gets a signal to start speaking. This time does not include confirmations from receiving users.\nThe MCPTT Access time (KPI 1) does not include the time for an MCPTT User to affiliate to the group. This is a common scenario within public safety, meaning that affiliations to MCPTT Groups are long lived during several working hours. KPI 1 is applicable in both an MCPTT Group call setup request and subsequent MCPTT Requests that are part of the same call. KPI 1 for subsequent MCPTT Requests might take a slightly shorter time than the first MCPTT setup request of the same call due to its potential need of resource allocation in terms of bearer establishment. However from an end user perspective there is no need to differentiate required performance for an MCPPT Group call setup request and subsequent MCPTT Requests.\nThe End-to-end MCPTT Access time (KPI 2) is defined as the time between when an MCPTT User requests to speak (normally by pressing the MCPTT control on the MCPTT UE) and when this user gets a signal to start speaking, including MCPTT call establishment (if applicable) and possibly acknowledgement from first receiving user before voice can be transmitted. Group calls can be set up with or without acknowledgements from receiving users.\nFor MCPTT Private Calls (with Floor control), end-to-end MCPTT Access time (also KPI 2) is measured from the initiating client’s Private call request to reception of either a Private Call response for automatic commencement or the MCPTT ringing indication for manual commencement. End-to-end access time for both automatic and manual commencement private calls (KPI 2) is shown in Figure 6.15.3.1.1.\nNOTE:\tThe End-to-end MCPTT Access time (KPI 2) is not applicable for an MCPTT Group transmission call setup when no acknowledgement is requested from any Affiliated MCPTT Group Member.\nThe Mouth-to-ear latency (KPI 3) is the time between an utterance by the transmitting user, and the playback of the utterance at the receiving user's speaker.

The purpose of this feature allows the dispatcher to listen to activities at the Location of the remote MCPTT UE to find out what is happening around that MCPTT UE. This feature is also known as \"Remote Unit Monitoring\" in P25 systems.\nThere are two typical use cases for this feature.\nThe first one is the case where a user could have been incapacitated. This could be both accidentally, say a traffic accident, or deliberately, for example a violent attack. In both cases it would be necessary to remotely open the microphone of the MCPTT UE in order to allow another user or a group of users to listen to what is happening to prepare assistance. The communication that is set up is either a Private Call or a Group Call, and the call could optionally be visible to the remote MCPTT UE's user.\nThe second one is the case of a stolen MCPTT UE. Here it is just necessary to activate the radio so that a dispatcher can listen to any background noise or speech in order to make an analysis of the situation. In this situation, the initiation of the call from the remote MCPTT UE, typically a Private Call in that case, is not visible by that MCPTT UE's user.\nOther use cases, such as undercover operations, discreet surveillance of users or investigations, could exist depending on the missions of the critical communications users and on legislations.\nThe behaviour of the remotely initiated Call is not different from a normal call initiated by the local user. The same rules for resource allocation and interactions with other services apply, but the initiator of the feature can have the capability to request a pre-emptive or high priority for that Call to ensure it is set up even in case of resource congestion or to limit disturbance by other services.\n",

                    "summary": "",
                    "text_content": "The MCPTT Service while operating in off-network mode comprises a set or collection of functions necessary to provide Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) using a ProSe direct (UE-to-UE) Communication path (ProSe direct communication path) for transport. The ProSe direct communication path does not traverse the network infrastructure.\nUsers operating off the network are either out of network coverage (not served by a 3GPP network) (e.g., in a remote mountain area fighting a forest fire 20 miles from the nearest network) or have selected a ProSe direct communication path for MCPTT while in network coverage. MCPTT Users operating off the network need to be in ProSe direct communication range in order to communicate.\nNOTE 1:\tWhile the network is likely to be a primary, reliable transport of MCPTT communications, there are many situations where MCPTT communications are needed in areas where the network is not available, or coverage is not reliable.\nMCPTT Users outside of the coverage of the fixed network might be first responders in a rural area assisting in a response to a plane crash, fire fighters in a remote mountain area fighting a forest fire or police officers inside a residence responding to a domestic issue. Off-network MCPTT communications are expected to be immediately accessible to users in the absence of the network.\nMCPTT Users in network coverage might be working in a confined area, such as fire fighters fighting a structure fire where direct UE-to-UE communication is more desirable and reliable. Users can communicate directly with one another without having to overcome the resistance of a building and distance to the nearest base station to communicate with other members of their team inside the building that are nearby.\nTo operate off the network, an MCPTT UE is capable of automatically switching to a ProSe direct communication path for use of MCPTT when detecting an off-network (out of coverage) condition. In addition a mechanism is provided for an authorized user to select (manually switch to) a ProSe direct communication path for use of off-network MCPTT communications (e.g., while in network coverage).\nWhen operating off the network, the MCPTT Service is provided by the MCPTT application on the UE as compared to operations on the network, where the MCPTT Application on the UE interacts with an MCPTT server and the network to provide the MCPTT Service.\nNOTE 2:\tFor MCPTT UEs that have selected a ProSe Direct Communication path for use of MCPTT while in network coverage, signalling with the network and MCPTT Service might be available (e.g., radio resource allocation, MCPTT User Profile management updates and cryptographic key management updates), while the MCPTT User transmissions would be direct between the MCPTT UEs (e.g., not traversing the network).\nThe Off-Network MCPTT Service builds upon ProSe enablers to establish, maintain and terminate the signalling and communication path(s) among the off-network users. To the extent feasible, it is expected that the end user's experience is similar regardless if the MCPTT Service is used with a 3GPP network or based on the use of a ProSe direct communication path.\nThe Off-Network MCPTT Service is intended to support communication between a group of users (a group call), where each user has the ability to gain access to the permission to talk in an arbitrated manner. However, the MCPTT Service also supports Private Calls between pairs of users.\nWhen operating off the network the MCPTT Service allows users to request the permission to talk (transmit voice/audio) and provides a deterministic mechanism to arbitrate between requests that are in contention (i.e., Floor control).\nThe Off-Network MCPTT Service provides a means for a user with higher priority (e.g., MCPTT Emergency condition) to override (interrupt) the current talker. The Off-Network MCPTT Service also supports a mechanism to limit the time a user talks (hold the floor) thus permitting users of the same or lower priority a chance to gain the floor.\nThe Off-Network MCPTT Service provides the means for a user to monitor activity on a number of separate calls and enables the user to switch focus to a chosen call. An Off-Network MCPTT Service user might join an already established MCPTT Group call (Late call entry). In addition the Off-Network MCPTT Service supports User IDs, aliases and user Location determination features.\nFor operation off the network (e.g., when out of network coverage), an MCPTT UE is (pre-)provisioned by an MCPTT Administrator and/or authorized user with the following in order to use MCPTT:\nAn MCPTT User Profile associated with each of the intended MCPTT Users of the MCPTT UE that might be used for off-network operation;\nAn alphanumeric identifier (with a minimum length of N3) (i.e., alias) for each MCPTT User;\nA number of off-network MCPTT Groups for use by the MCPTT User;\nAn alphanumeric identifier (i. e., alias) for the authorized off-network MCPTT Groups;\nA Mission Critical Organization name if available, associated with each of the intended MCPTT Users or Administrator;\nA number of off-network MCPTT Users for Private Call for which the MCPTT User is authorized;\nAuthentication and end to end security keys.\nNOTE 3:\tMCPTT UEs can be provisioned for off-network use by either configuration outside of network coverage or by attaching to the network.\nAn MCPTT UE operating off the network is capable of transmitting the talker Location information, User ID, alias(es), off-network MCPTT Group ID, group alias and, if available, Mission Critical Organization name of the user who is talking (i.e., whose UE is transmitting) to all other users in a call including MCPTT UEs operating off the network that are late entering a call in progress.\nThe Off-Network MCPTT Service uses the capabilities defined in ProSe TS 22.278 [5], including the ProSe Relay capabilities defined in ProSe TS 22.278 [5] and GCSE_LTE TS 22.468 [6].\nNOTE 4:\tAs indicated in TS 22.278 [5] use of a ProSe Direct Communication path outside of network coverage is only applicable for Public Safety ProSe enabled UEs. For non-Public Safety ProSe enabled UEs the selection of the most appropriate communication path (ProSe Communication path (direct or routed via local basestation) or 3GPP network path) is under network control and based on operator preferences.\nMCPTT Service requirements specific to off-network use are defined in clause 7. Common MCPTT service requirements defined in clause 5 apply whether the MCPTT Service is in use on the network or off the network.\n",

The MCPTT Access time is defined as the time between when an MCPTT User requests to speak (normally by pressing the MCPTT control on the UE) and when this user gets a signal to start speaking. This time does not include confirmations from receiving users.\nThe Mouth-to-ear latency (KPI 3) is the time between an utterance by the transmitting user, and the playback of the utterance at the receiving user's speaker. Figure 7.11.1.1.1 illustrates the MCPTT Access time and Mouth-to-ear latency.\nFigure 7 illustrates the access time and mouth-to-ear latency of MCPTT (Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk) in a telecommunication context. The figure depicts the time it takes for a user to initiate a call and for the call to be received by the intended recipient, as well as the delay between speaking and the recipient hearing the message. The figure highlights the importance of low latency in mission-critical communication, emphasizing the need for quick and efficient call processing. Key components include the MCPTT server, the user's device, and the recipient's device, with the latency represented by the lines connecting them. The figure also shows the impact of various factors, such as network congestion and device capabilities, on the overall latency.\nFigure 7.11.1.1-1: Illustration of MCPTT Access time and Mouth-to-ear latency\nNOTE:\tThe MCPTT Access time and Mouth-to-ear latency for off-network use is FFS.\n",

The performance requirements for Late call entry time only applies to when there is ongoing voice transmitted at the time the MCPTT User joins the call.\nIn a Late call entry there might be an initial lost audio of the voice burst sent to the new Receiving MCPTT Group Member.\nNOTE:\tThe Late call entry time (KPI 4) for off-network use is FFS.\n",
