The framework is composed of various components, including the measurement data collector, data processing unit, and data storage system. The measurement data collector is responsible for collecting data from different sources within the system, while the data processing unit processes the collected data to extract meaningful insights. The data storage system is then used to store the processed data for future reference and analysis. The framework also includes interfaces for communication between the different components, ensuring seamless data flow and efficient data management.\nFigure 4.2-1: Management framework for measurement data collection\n",

Energy efficiency for mobile networks is very important, since 5G networks will consume more energy due to the vast number of mmWave small cells. The network energy saving use case in TR 37.817 [2] utilizes the AI/ML techniques with model training residing in OAM and model inference residing in the gNB, where OAM will need to collect input data from RAN nodes to enable the network energy saving model training, and then deploy the model to the gNB to perform the inference function that will determine the energy saving actions based on the input data received from the serving node.\nTherefore, to support the model training residing in OAM, 3GPP management service producer should be able to collect the following input data (see clause 5.1.2.4 in TR 37.817 [2]):\n-\tFrom serving node:\n-\tUE mobility/trajectory prediction.\n-\tCurrent/Predicted Energy efficiency.\n-\tCurrent/Predicted resource status.\n-\tFrom the UE:\n-\tUE location information (e.g. coordinates, serving cell ID, moving velocity) interpreted by gNB implementation when available.\n-\tUE measurement report (e.g. UE RSRP, RSRQ, SINR measurement, etc.), including cell level and beam level UE measurements.\n-\tFrom neighbouring NG-RAN nodes:\n-\tCurrent/Predicted energy efficiency.\n-\tCurrent/Predicted resource status.\n-\tCurrent energy state (e.g. active, high, low, inactive).\nTo optimize the performance of AI/ML-based network energy saving model, following feedback can be considered to be collected from NG-RAN nodes:\n-\tResource status of neighbouring NG-RAN nodes.\n-\tEnergy efficiency.\n-\tUE performance affected by the energy saving action (e.g. handed-over UEs), including bitrate, packet loss, latency.\n-\tSystem KPIs (e.g. throughput, delay, RLF of current and neighbouring NG-RAN node).\nNote: The data of resource status and energy efficiency are to be defined in the stage 2 and stage 3 solutions for Network energy saving use case.\n",

It is quite challenging to steer the traffic in a balanced distribution so that the network performance could be assured. Load balancing had been proposed to address the issue. The objective of load balancing is to distribute load evenly among cells and among areas of cells, or to transfer part of the traffic from congested cells or from congested areas of cells, or to offload users from one cell, cell area, carrier or RAT to improve network performance. This can be done by means of optimization of handover parameters and handover actions. AI/ML capabilities, e.g. traffic load prediction, prediction of selected UE and/or target cell for handover, could be introduced to improve the load balance performance, in terms of the quality user experience and system capacity. It also enables the network automation which would help to reduce human intervention in the network management and optimization tasks. To support the AI/ML based load balancing in RAN, the related AI/ML Model can be trained, validated and tested in OAM while AI/ML Model inference could be done in the gNB. In case of CU-DU split architecture, AI/ML Model Training can be located in the OAM and AI/ML Model Inference can be located in the gNB-CU.\nTo facilitate the AI/ML Model Training, validation and testing in OAM, 3GPP management service producer should be able to collect the input data, output data as well as the feedback of AI/ML based load balancing. (see clause 5.2.2. in TR 37.817 [2]). Note that the output data can be used as the label for the supervised learning. The feedback of AI/ML based load balancing data could be used to re-tune the AI/ML model and optimize the AI/ML model for load balancing.\nTo support the model training residing in OAM, 3GPP management service producer should be able to collect the following input data:\n-\tFrom serving node:\n-\tCurrent and predicted resource status.\n-\tUE trajectory prediction.\n-\tCurrent and predicted UE traffic.\n-\tPredicted resource status information of neighboring NG-RAN node(s).\n-\tInter-gNB conditional handovers.\n-\tIntra-gNB conditional handovers.\n-\tFrom neighbouring NG-RAN nodes:\n-\tCurrent and predicted resource status.\n-\tUE performance measurement at traffic offloaded neighbouring cell.\n-\tFrom the UE:\n-\tUE location information (e.g. coordinates, serving cell ID, moving velocity) interpreted by gNB implementation when available.\n-\tUE Mobility History Information.\n-\tUE measurement report (e.g. UE RSRP, RSRQ, SINR measurement, etc.), including cell level and beam level UE measurements.\nTo support the model training residing in OAM, 3GPP management service producer should be able to collect the following output data.

The gNB sends the RRCReconfiguration message with measConfig IE to determine the type of measurements to be collected by UE. UE returns the measurement in the MeasurementReport message.\nFigure 5.3.3.0 -1: UE measurement report configuration represents a detailed configuration of a user equipment (UE) measurement report, which is essential for network operators to monitor and analyze the performance of their mobile networks. The figure illustrates various parameters that are crucial for assessing the quality of service (QoS) and identifying potential issues in the network. These parameters include signal strength, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and handover metrics, among others. The configuration also highlights the importance of accurate and timely UE measurement reports in optimizing network performance and ensuring a seamless user experience.\nFigure 5.3.3.0-1: UE measurement report configuration\nTherefore, gNB already receives UE measurement report (e.g. RSRP, RSRQ, SINR, etc.) that can be used as input data for the model training without any additional trigger.\nFigure 5.3.3-2 shows that MnF of performance assurance management can be used to collect the UE measurements.
