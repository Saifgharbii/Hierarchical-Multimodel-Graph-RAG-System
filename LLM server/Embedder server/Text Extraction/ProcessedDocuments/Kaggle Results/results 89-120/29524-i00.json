Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced document.\nshould\tindicates a recommendation to do something\nshould not\tindicates a recommendation not to do something\nmay\tindicates permission to do something\nneed not\tindicates permission not to do something\nThe construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.\ncan\tindicates that something is possible\ncannot\tindicates that something is impossible\nThe constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and \"need not\".\nwill\tindicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document\nwill not\tindicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document\nmight\tindicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document\nmight not\tindicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document\nIn addition:\nis\t(or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of fact\nis not\t(or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of fact\nThe constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.\n",
