There are several general functions and entities (e.g. configuration, identity) which are used by the MC services. The general functional architecture to support MC services utilizes aspects of the IMS architecture specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 [2].\nAn MC service UE in the 5GS context obtains access to a MC service via 3GPP access (i.e., E-UTRA, 5G NR), wireless non-3GPP access (e.g. WLAN or Satellite) and/or wireline access using the 5GS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7]. Certain MC service functions such as dispatch and administrative functions can be supported using MC service UEs with 3GPP access and non-3GPP wireless/wireline access. External applications usage of MC services can be enabled via 3GPP access and/or non-3GPP access.\nNOTE:\tDispatch consoles and devices used by MC service administrators are considered as MC service UEs to support MC services.\n",

The architectural figures in this clause are aligned  with the 5GS architecture for MBS shown in Figure 5.1-2 of 3GPP TS 23.247 [15], which identifies both mandatory and optional functional entities and interfaces, in reference point representation, available for use by the MC services.\nMulticast and broadcast communication services in 5G for MC group communications rely on the creation and establishment of MBS sessions to deliver user data in downlink. Shared and individual delivery from the MC service server to multiple MC users (i.e., users affiliated to a certain MC group) is supported either as point-to-point or point-to-multipoint over the radio. The MBS sessions are either broadcast or multicast type and consist of one or multiple QoS flows for different service requirements. For the broadcast MBS session or local MBS session, the MBS service area is configured with the MBS session.\nNOTE 1:\tSupport of MBS and specific session types is an implementation choice.\nWithin this arrangement, the MC service server decides whether to create broadcast or multicast MBS sessions to be associated with certain MC groups. The 5GC adaptively decides whether to deliver the MBS traffic from the MB-UPF in the form of shared delivery or individual delivery, where the latter is applicable to multicast MBS sessions only. The NG-RAN decides to utilize point-to-point or point-to-multipoint delivery methods applicable for shared delivery only. MBS provides reliability enhancements and minimizes loss of information, e.g., due to mobility and handover.\nMBS group scheduling mechanism enables simultaneous reception of MBS and unicast user traffic by the MC service UEs. The UEs can receive broadcast MBS sessions irrespective of their RRC state (i.e., connected, inactive or idle) and multicast sessions only in RRC-CONNECTED and RRC-INACTIVE state.\nThe following capabilities (non-exhaustive list) provided by MBS could be used by MC service servers as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]:\n-\tMBS session creation;\n-\tMBS session update;\n-\tMBS session release;\n-\tMBS session ID allocation;\n-\tTransparent MBS Data forwarding;\n-\tDynamic PCC control for MBS session;\n-\tUE's MBS assistance information provision.\n",

                            "text_content": "This clause describes deployment scenarios in which different administration of MC service, SIP core and 5GS are described, together with the sensitivities of identities and other forms of signalling in those scenarios.\nIn each of these scenarios, the owner of the devices at each plane may be different from the organization that administers these devices. For example, the MC service provider may own some RAN components within the 5GS even when the 5GS is administered by the PLMN operator, and the MC service UE may be owned by an organization that is independent from PLMN and MC service providers.\nIn this scenario, all planes (application services layer, SIP core and 5GS) are administered by the same party. This is illustrated in figure 6.3.1.2-1 below.\nFigure 6.3.1.2-1 illustrates the common administration of all services by one operator, showcasing a centralized management system that oversees various network services. The figure depicts a hierarchy of network elements, including the core network, access network, and customer premises equipment, all interconnected through a unified control and management platform. This approach enables efficient resource allocation, service provisioning, and policy enforcement, ultimately improving the overall operational efficiency and user experience.\nFigure 6.3.1.2-1: Common administration of all services by one operator\nAlthough the identities in each plane are separate as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3], there is no particular sensitivity of identities and other information at the application plane, and these may be exposed to the SIP core and the 5GS.\nAll authorization and authentication mechanisms at each plane, i.e. the application services layer, SIP core and 5GS, shall be separate, but there may be no need for any restrictions in how these are stored and managed; for example the same entity could provide services to each of the application services layer, SIP core and 5GS.\nIn this scenario, as illustrated in figure 6.3.1.3-1, the MC service provider is separate and independent from the PLMN operator, and the MC service is administered independently of the 5GS and SIP core. The PLMN operator administers the 5GS and the SIP core.\nFigure 6.3.1.3-1 illustrates the separation of Multimedia Communication (MC) services from the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) core and 5G System (5GS) in the administration of service providers. The figure depicts the MC service as a distinct entity, managed independently from the SIP core and 5GS. This separation allows for more efficient management and control of MC services, enabling service providers to tailor their offerings to better meet the needs of their customers. The figure highlights the importance of clear demarcation between different types of services, emphasizing the need for a well-defined network architecture to support diverse communication requirements.\nFigure 6.3.1.3-1: MC service provider administers MC service separately from SIP core and 5GS\nThe MC service provider may require that all application services layer identities and other sensitive information are hidden both from the SIP core and the 5GS.\nWhen required by the MC service provider, all authentication and authorization mechanisms, including security roots, at the application services layer are hidden from and not available to the PLMN operator.\nIn this scenario, as illustrated in figure 6.3.1.4-1, the MC service provider administers the SIP core, and the MC services and SIP core are independent of the PLMN operator.\nFigure 6.3.1.4-1 illustrates the service provider's provision of SIP core, with a separate domain from 5G services. The figure depicts the core network elements, including the Session Border Controller (SBC), Multimedia Session Control Function (MSC), and Home Subscriber Server (HSS). The separation of the SIP core from 5G services is highlighted, emphasizing the importance of maintaining network integrity and security.\nFigure 6.3.1.4-1: MC service provider provision of SIP core, separate domain from 5GS\nThe MC service provider may require that all identities and other sensitive information at the application services layer are hidden from the 5GS. The MC service provider need not hide the identities and signalling at the application services layer from the SIP core. However, the MC service provider may require that identities and other sensitive information between SIP core and SIP client in the MC service UE are also hidden from the 5GS.\nAll authentication and authorization mechanisms, including security roots, at both application services layer and at SIP signalling plane may need to be hidden from, and not available to, the PLMN operator.\nIn this scenario, as illustrated in figure 6.3.1.5-1, the SIP core is partially administered by both parties, for example when the SIP core registrar is administered by the MC service provider, but the SIP core registrar finder and proxy is administered by the PLMN operator.\nFigure 6.3.1.5-1 illustrates a service provider's partial provisioning of the SIP core, with a separate domain dedicated to 5G services. The figure depicts the interconnection of multiple domains, including the 5G domain, which is highlighted in a distinct color. The 5G domain is connected to the legacy SIP core through a series of interfaces, emphasizing the coexistence of legacy and 5G services. The figure also shows the separation of the 5G domain from the rest of the network, highlighting the importance of isolating 5G services for efficient management and control.\nFigure 6.3.1.5-1: MC service provider partial provision of SIP core, separate domain from 5GS\nThe MC service provider may require that all identities and signalling at the application services layer are hidden from the 5GS, and may require identities and other sensitive information to be hidden from the PLMN operator administered part of the SIP core.\nAll authentication and authorization mechanisms, including security roots, at the application services layer may need to be hidden from, and not available to, the PLMN operator.\nIn this scenario, the PLMN operator administers the SIP core. However, the identities used by the SIP core (IMPI and IMPU) for MC service UEs served by the MC service provider are provided from the SIP database of the MC service provider.\nFigure 6.3.1.6-1 illustrates the process of a mobile network operator (MNO) providing identities to a mobile service provider (MSP) through the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) core. The figure depicts the interaction between the MNO's SIP core and the MSP's SIP core, highlighting the exchange of authentication and authorization information. The diagram emphasizes the secure and controlled sharing of subscriber data between the two networks, ensuring proper access control and service delivery.\nFigure 6.3.1.6-1: MC service provider provides identities to PLMN operator SIP core\nThe MC service provider may require that all identities and signalling at the application services layer are hidden from the SIP core and 5GS.\nWhen required by the MC service provider, all authentication and authorization mechanisms, including security roots, at the application services layer may need to be hidden from, and not available to, the PLMN operator.\nThe security roots (authentication keys) required for access to the signalling control plane are not available to the PLMN operator as these are held in the MC service provider's SIP database. However, derived parameters e.g. authentication vectors are provided to the SIP core to allow signalling control plane authentication to take place.\n",

The MC service server may consider the UE's capabilities and service related information e.g., UE's MBS capabilities, location, MBS listening status report sent by group members when it decides to create or use MBS sessions. The MC service server needs to interact with the 5GC for this matter. During the interaction, the necessary information related to the requested session is determined, e.g., MBS session mode (either a broadcast or a multicast session) and the required QoS profile. This interaction depends on the configuration option under consideration, i.e., whether the MC service server is in trusted domain (limited operations), and whether the session creation is done with or without a dynamic PCC rule.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is implementation specific whether the MC service server decides to use multicast or broadcast MBS sessions.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is implementation specific whether the MC service server decides to create (one or multiple) MBS sessions for MC media for MC group communications associated to a certain MC group or create (one or multiple) dynamic MBS sessions once the need has emerged, e.g., dynamic MBS sessions to be associated for an ad hoc group.\nNOTE 3:\tIt is implementation specific whether an MBS session is associated to one or multiple MC groups, and whether it is re-assigned to other MC groups.\nNOTE 4:\tHow the MC service server uses the UE's capabilities and service related information in order to create and use the MBS session is implementation specific.\nThe information elements describing the MBS session under consideration is then sent to the MC service clients via MBS session announcement, where the latter need to react according to the announced session mode.\nIf eMBMS and 5G MBS co-exist for MC services, the MC service server may decide to trigger the establishment of an eMBMS bearer to deliver the MC media associated to the MC service group communications, if the target MC service group(s) consists of members with eMBMS capable UE.

However, if dynamic PCC rule is considered, the MC service server defines these requirements at a later step, namely it sends an MBS authorization/policy create request towards PCF (either directly or to the NEF) indicating the QoS requirements.\nNOTE 1:\tIn case of LTE eMBMS and 5G MBS co-existence, the MC service server may trigger the establishment of eMBMS bearers as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3] (or it may establish a unicast bearer) based on the RAT capabilities supported by the affiliated members in the MC service group X. If MBSF and BM-SC are co-located, TMGI used by 4G eMBMS can be the same as the MBS session ID.\nNOTE 2:\tFor the case of multi carrier support for broadcast MBS sessions, the MC service server may indicate the frequencies within a broadcast MBS service area by providing the MBS frequency selection area ID(s) (MBS FSA ID(s)) to the MB-SMF, or indirectly, via NEF.\n2.\tThe MC service server provides the MC service clients affiliated to MC service group X with the information related to the created MBS session via the MBS session announcement. As described in table 7.3.2.1-1, the MBS session announcement includes information such as the MBS session ID, MBS session mode (broadcast or multicast service type) and SDP information related to the MBS session under consideration.\nNOTE 3:\tThe MC service server may send an MBS session announcement at an earlier step during the MBS session creation procedure towards the MC service clients once the MC group associated to the MBS session is known.\nOptionally, the MC service server includes the information elements related to the established eMBMS bearer once the MC service server has determined the need, as indicated in table 7.3.2.1-1. The MC service clients which camp on LTE will subsequently react to the information elements related to the eMBMS bearer as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3].\n3.\tMC service clients store and process the received MBS session information.\n4.\tMC service clients may provide an MBS session announcement acknowledgment to the MC service server to indicate the reception of the corresponding MBS session announcement.\n5.\tBased on the MBS session mode (either multicast or broadcast), the following actions take place:\n5a.\tFor multicast MBS sessions, MC service clients initiate a UE session join request towards the 5GC using the information provided via the MBS session announcement. Hence, upon the first successful UE session join request, the multicast is then established, and the radio resources are reserved, if the session is in an active state. The established session can either be in active or inactive state as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]. The MC service clients sends a UE session join notification towards the server. If indicated in the MBS session announcement information, MC service clients report the monitoring state (i.e., the reception quality of the MBS session) back to the MC service server; or\n5b.\tFor broadcast MBS sessions, if the MC service client is accessing over 5G, the session is established as part of the session creation procedures as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15], and the network resources are reserved both in 5GC and NG-RAN. The MC service clients start monitoring the reception quality of the broadcast MBS session. If indicated in the MBS session announcement information, MC service clients report the monitoring state (i.e., the reception quality of the MBS session) back to the MC service server.\nNOTE 4:\t\tIt is implementation specific whether the MBS session reception quality level is determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS flow level via e.g., measurements of radio level signals, such as the reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), or packet loss.\n6.\tThe MC service clients provide a listening status notification related to the announced session (multicast or broadcast session) in the form of an MBS listening status report.\n7.\tAn MC service group communication setup takes place as specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [6], 3GPP TS 23.281 [4], or 3GPP TS 23.282 [5]. The MC service server determines to use the pre-created MBS session for this group communication.\nIn this scenario, the group communication is already taken place and a unicast PDU session is utilized for MC DL transmission. When the MC service server decides to use an MBS session for the transmission under consideration, the MC service server interacts with 5GC to reserve the necessary network resources.\nNOTE 1:\tThe MC service server logic for determining when to create a dynamic MBS session is implementation specific.\nThe procedure in figure 7.3.3.1.3-1 shows one MC service client receiving the DL media. There might also be MC service clients in the same MC group communication session that receive the communication on an MBS session.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tMC service client is attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to a certain MC service group X.\n-\tThe MC service server is aware whether to request the creation of the MBS service server with or without dynamic PCC rule.\n-\tThe MC service server has performed MB-SMF discovery and selection either directly or indirectly, via NEF/MBSF, unless the corresponding information is locally configured.\n-\tNo MBS session exists, or the existing multicast MBS session fails to satisfy the QoS requirements.\nFigure 7.3.3.1.3-1 illustrates the utilization of dynamic Multi- BSS Session (MBS) in a telecommunication network, showcasing how multiple base stations (BSs) collaborate to manage sessions. The figure highlights the role of the Home Location Register (HLR) and the Mobility Management Entity (MME) in session establishment and maintenance. Key components include the Serving Mobile Switching Center (SMSC), Mobility Management Entity (MME), Home Location Register (HLR), and the Serving and Visiting Base Stations (BSs). The figure emphasizes the dynamic nature of session management, ensuring efficient resource allocation and seamless user experience.\nFigure 7.3.3.1.3-1: Use of dynamic MBS session.\n1.\tAn MC service group communication session is established as specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [6], 3GPP TS 23.281 [4], or 3GPP TS 23.282 [5].\n2.\tThe MC service server decides to create an MBS session. The MBS session creation procedure takes place as described in clause 7.3.3.1.\nNOTE 2:\tIn case of LTE eMBMS and 5G MBS co-existence, the MC service server may trigger the establishment of eMBMS bearers as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3] (or it may establish a unicast bearer) based on the RAT capabilities supported by the affiliated members in the MC service group X. If MBSF and BM-SC are co-located, TMGI used by 4G eMBMS can be the same as the MBS session ID.\nNOTE 3:\tFor the case of multi carrier support for broadcast MBS sessions, the MC service server may indicate the frequencies within a broadcast MBS service area by providing the MBS frequency selection area ID(s) (MBS FSA ID(s)) to the MB-SMF, or indirectly, via NEF.\n3.\tThe MC service server provides the MC service client with the information related to the created MBS session via an MBS session announcement. As described in table 7.3.2.1-1, the session announcement includes information such as the MBS session ID, MBS session mode (broadcast or multicast service type), and SDP information related to the MBS session.\nOptionally, the MC service server includes the information elements related to the established eMBMS bearer once the MC service server has determined the need, as indicated in table 7.3.2.1-1. The MC service clients which camp on LTE will subsequently react to the information elements related to the eMBMS bearer as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3].\n4.\tThe MC service client stores the MBS session ID and other associated information.\n5.\tThe MC service client may send an MBS session announcement ack back to the MC service server.\n6.\tBased on the MBS session mode (either multicast or broadcast), the following actions take place:\n6a.\tFor multicast MBS sessions, MC service client initiates a UE session join request towards the 5GC using the information provided via the MBS session announcement. Hence, upon the first successful UE session join request, the multicast is then established, and the radio resources are reserved, if the session is in active state. The established session can either be in active or inactive state as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]. The MC service client sends a UE session join notification towards the server. If indicated in the MBS session announcement information, MC service clients report the monitoring state (i.e., the reception quality of the MBS session) back to the MC service server; or\n6b.\tFor broadcast MBS sessions, if the MC service client is accessing over 5G, the session is established as part of the session creation procedures as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15], and the network resources are reserved both in 5GC and NG-RAN. The MC service clients start monitoring the reception quality of the broadcast MBS session. If indicated in the MBS session announcement information, MC service clients report the monitoring state (i.e., the reception quality of the MBS session) back to the MC service server.\nNOTE 4:\t\tIt is implementation specific whether the MBS session reception quality level is determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS flow level via e.g., measurements of radio level signalling such as the reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), packet loss.\n7.\tThe MC service clients provide a listening status notification related to the announced session (multicast or broadcast session) in the form of an MBS listening status report.\n8.\tAn MC service group communication via dynamic MBS session is established.\nThe MC service server can create one or several MBS sessions based on certain service requirements (e.g., QoS profile), a certain service area, or the activity status of multicast MBS sessions. However, during the life cycle of the MBS sessions, the MC service server may need to update the sessions to meet emerging needs, including the service requirements, service area related parameters, etc…, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].\nIn case of dynamic PCC rule, the MC service server needs to determine what aspects are needed to be updated (either service area related aspects/ multicast activation status, service requirements aspects, or both as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]) in order to interact with the required entity in the 5GC either directly, (in case the MC service server is in trusted domain), or indirectly via NEF/MBSF.\nThe procedure shown in figure 7.3.3.2.2-1 presents an MBS session update procedure triggered by the MC service server (either directly to the MB-SMF, or indirectly via NEF/MBSF). Within the update request, either the service requirements, MBS service area, activity status of multicast MBS session, or all three are done, as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe MC service clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to the same active MC service group.\n-\tThe MC service server has obtained the required information related to the MB-SMF, either locally configured or during initial session configuration.\n-\tThe MBS session is created with certain service requirements and optionally with a certain broadcast/multicast service area. The MBS session is announced to be associated with the MC service group for group communication purposes.\nFigure 7.3.3.2.2-1 illustrates the process of updating a Mobile Broadband Session (MBS) without the use of dynamic Packet Channel Control (PCC). The figure depicts the various stages of the session update process, including the initial setup, data transmission, and final confirmation. Key components such as the Mobile Switching Center (MSC), Home Location Register (HLR), and Packet Data Network (PDN) Gateway are shown, highlighting the interconnection and communication between them. The figure emphasizes the importance of efficient session management in mobile networks, ensuring seamless connectivity and optimal resource allocation.\nFigure 7.3.3.2.2-1: MBS session update without dynamic PCC.\n1.\tAn MBS session is established as described in in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15] (either a multicast or a broadcast session), and associated with a certain active MC group for group communication purposes. In the case of a multicast MBS session, the MC service clients have already joined the session.\n2.\tThe MC service server invokes an MBS session update request towards the 5GC (either directly to the MB-SMF or indirectly via NEF/MBSF) once the need has emerged to modify some aspects for the given MBS session under consideration. Hence, the MC service server sends the MBS session update request as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15] and either directly to the MB-SMF or indirectly via NEF/MBSF, indicating the MBS session ID to be updated. Along with the update request, the updated aspects are sent, which are either service requirements (required QoS), service area, or both. In case of multicast MBS sessions, the MC service server may as well update the status (active or inactive) of the multicast MBS session once needed within the update request.\nNOTE 1:\tThe updated service area information is required for local MBS and for broadcast MBS services.\n3.\tBased on the needed requirements, the corresponding MBS session is accordingly modified, as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]. The update may lead to QoS Flow(s) addition, modification, or removal.\n4.\tThe MC service server receives an MBS session update response as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15], once the requested modifications are performed, and the indicated MBS session is updated accordingly.\n5.\tThe MC service server may initiate a session announcement towards the MC service clients associated with the ongoing session in order to announce the updated information, if required, e.g., the updated service area or SDP information.\nNOTE 2:\tThe updated service area information is required for local MBS and for broadcast MBS services.\n6.\tThe MC service server sends an MapGroupToSessionStream over the configured MBS session providing the required information to receive the media related to the established MC service group communication.\n7.\tThe MC service clients process the received information over the MapGroupToSessionStream in order to receive the associated MC media over the specific MBS session stream.\n8.\tMC service client 1 sends media to the MC service server over unicast to be distributed for the established group communication.\n9.\tThe MC service server distributes the MC media to the MC services clients 2 to n over the indicated streams.\nThe procedure shown in figure 7.3.3.2.3-1 presents an MBS session update procedure triggered by the MC service server to the 5GC, either directly or via NEF/MBSF. Based on the required updates to be done, the MC service server needs to interact with the MB-SMF to update the MBS service area and multicast activity status, with the PCF to update the required QoS requirements, or sequentially both to update all the above, as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe MC service clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to the same active MC service group.\n-\tThe MC service server has obtained the required information related to the MB-SMF, either locally configured or during initial session configuration.\n-\tThe MBS session is created with certain service requirements and optionally with a certain broadcast/multicast service area. The MBS session is announced to be associated with the MC service group for group communication purposes.\nFigure 7.3.3.2.3 -1 illustrates the process of a Mobile-Broadband Session Update (MBSU) with dynamic PCC (Packet Classification Code) in a telecommunication network. The figure depicts the session update process, which involves the mobile device (UE) and the home location register (HLR) communicating to update the session parameters. The dynamic PCC is a crucial aspect of this process, as it allows for efficient classification and routing of data packets. The figure highlights the role of the home location register (HLR) and the mobile switching center (MSC) in coordinating the session update, ensuring seamless communication and optimal network performance.\nFigure 7.3.3.2.3-1: MBS session update with dynamic PCC.\n1.\tAn MBS session is established as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15] (either a multicast or a broadcast MBS session), and associated with a certain active MC group for group communication purposes. In the case of a multicast MBS session, the MC service clients have already joined the MBS session.\n2.\tThe MC service server, based on the update requirements (i.e., MBS service area and/or the multicast MBS session activity status as well as the service requirements), perform the MBS session update with PCC procedure towards the 5GS as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15] and/or the MBS session activate/deactivate procedure as described in clause 7.3.3.4.\nNOTE 1:\tThe updated service area information is required for local MBS and for broadcast MBS services.\n3.\tThe MC service server may initiate a MBS session announcement towards the MC service clients associated with the ongoing MBS session in order to announce the updated information if required, e.g., the updated service area or SDP information.\nNOTE 2:\tThe updated service area information is required for local MBS and for broadcast MBS services.\n4.\tThe MC service server sends an MapGroupToSessionStream over the MBS session providing the required information to receive the media related to the established MC service group communication.\n5.\tThe MC service clients process the received information over the MapGroupToSessionStream in order to receive the associated MC media over the specific MBS session stream.\n6.\tMC service client 1 sends media to the MC service server over unicast to be distributed for the established group communication.\n7.\tThe MC service server distributes the MC media to the MC services clients 2 to n over the indicated streams.\nThe MC service server can decide to release a certain MBS session once it is no longer further utilized for the associated MC service group communication, e.g., the MC service group is no longer active, the MC media transmission is over and no further MC media to be delivered, group communication is terminated. The MBS session deletion procedure leads to releasing the network resources associated to that MBS session.\nNOTE:\tIt is up to implementation of MC service server to decide whether to release the MBS session or re-use it for subsequent group operations.\nTo delete the MBS session, the MC service server sends an MBS session deletion request to the 5GS providing the corresponding MBS session ID. The MBS session deletion request is sent to the MB-SMF (directly or via NEF/MBSF) when PCC is not used. However, if dynamic PCC rule is utilized, a policy authorization deletion request is initially sent to the PCF. Further details are provided in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].\nMC service server further informs the MC service client with the MBS session de-announcement, so that the MC client UE stops monitoring the broadcast MBS session or leaves the multicast MBS session. This procedure is applied for both broadcast MBS session and multicast MBS session.\nThe procedure in figure 7.3.3.3.2-1 describes the MBS session deletion aspects for group communication.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tMC service clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to the same active MC service group.\n-\tAn MBS session is configured to address the corresponding MC service group with certain service requirements and optionally with a certain broadcast/multicast service area. The session is announced and established for group communication purposes for the MC service group.\nFigure 7.3.3.3.2-1 illustrates the step-by-step procedure for deleting a Mobile Broadband Session (MBS) in a telecommunication network. The figure begins with the initial state where an MBS session is established between the user equipment (UE) and the Mobile Switching Center (MSC). The process then shows the UE requesting the deletion of the session, which leads to the MSC notifying the Home Location Register (HLR) and the Authentication Center (AuC) of the session termination. The HLR then updates its records, and the AuC confirms the session deletion. The figure emphasizes the importance of coordination between various network components for a smooth and efficient session termination.\nFigure 7.3.3.3.2-1: MBS session deletion procedure.\n1.\tThe MC service server decides to delete the MBS session for the associated MC group communication, either multicast or broadcast session.\n2.\tThe MC service server sends an MBS session de-announcement message with the MBS session ID towards the MC service client(s). Upon receiving the MBS session de-announcement message, either 3a or 3b is performed.\n3a.\tIf the MBS session identified by MBS session ID is a broadcast MBS session, the MC service client(s) stops monitoring the broadcast MBS session and removes the broadcast MBS session related information.\n3b.\tIf the MBS session identified by MBS session ID is a multicast MBS session, the joined MC service client(s) initiate an MBS session leave procedure to leave the indicated MBS session in order to release the respective network resources, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].\n4. Subsequently, the MC service clients may send an MBS session de-announcement acknowledgement message to the MC service server indicating the status of MBS session.\n5.\tThe MC service server initiates the MBS session deletion procedure with the 5GC (either directly or through NEF/MBSF) in order to stop using the configured MBS session and release the corresponding network resources. The MC service server indicates within the MBS session release request the corresponding MBS session ID. The MBS session deletion procedure can either be with or without a dynamic PCC rule, as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].\nIn case of multicast MBS sessions, the members affiliated to a certain MC group need to initiate a UE session join request towards the 5GC in order to receive the MC media sent via the associated MBS session. The UE session join request enables the reservation of NG-RAN resources for the members of the MC group. However, it is not necessary that the MC media is delivered over the whole time the multicast MBS session is associated to the group under consideration. Therefore, the MC service server is able to efficiently utilize and control the reservation of radio resources based on the availability of MC data to be delivered via the activation and de-activation procedure. This presents more flexibility and efficient use of resources different from LTE.\nThe most suitable scenario to activate/de-activate a certain multicast MBS session is based on whether there is an MC group call, e.g., MCPTT group call, taking place over that associated MBS session to the MC group. In this manner, the MC service server can activate the associated multicast session once an MC group call takes place, then deactivate it once the MC group call is over. Whether the multicast session is activated (i.e., in an active state), or de-activated (in an inactive state), the MC group is associated to the multicast session and its members are within a UE session join.\nThe MBS session update request with the requested MBS session status is triggered by the MC service server either directly towards the MB-SMF or indirectly via NEF/MBSF.\nNOTE:\tThe activation of de-activation procedure may also be triggered by MB-SMF based on receiving notification from MB-UPF based on the availability of MC data to be transmitted.\nThe procedure shown in figure 7.3.3.4.2-1 presents the multicast MBS session activation procedure triggered by the MC service server.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tMC service clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to the same MC service group X.\n-\tThe MC service server has directly performed (or via NEF/MBSF) an MB-SMF discovery and selection, unless the corresponding information is locally configured.\n-\tThe MC service server has decided to use a multicast MBS session for MC service group communications associated to MC service group X.\n-\tThe MBS session is created and announced to address MC group communication related to the associated MC service group X with certain service requirements and optionally with a certain service area.\n\nFigure 7.3.3.4.2-1 illustrates the multicast MBS session activation procedure, which involves the activation of a Multicast Base Station (MBS) session. The figure shows the process of session activation, including the involvement of the MBS, the Mobile Switching Center (MSC), and the Home Location Register (HLR). The figure highlights the role of the MBS in managing the session and the interaction between the MBS and the MSC, as well as the HLR's role in session management. The figure also shows the importance of the session context in the activation process, which is used to manage the session and ensure its proper functioning. The figure is a valuable resource for understanding the multicast MBS session activation procedure and its role in the overall network.\nFigure 7.3.3.4.2-1: Multicast MBS session activation procedure.\n1.\tThe multicast MBS session is established as the first UE session join request, which is initiated by the first MC service UE towards 5GC, is granted. At this stage, the multicast MBS session is established with an inactive state.\n2.\tThe MC service server decides to activate the multicast MBS session as MC data is needed to be transmitted over the MBS session to the MC group X, as an MC group communication (e.g., MCPTT group call) is to take place over the associated MBS session.\n3.\tThe MC service sends an MBS session update request towards the 5GC, either directly to the MB-SMF or via NEF/MBSF, indicating the MBS session ID to be activated as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].\n4.\tThe 5GC changes the MBS session status to \"active\" and finds the list of joined MC service UEs associated with the MBS session and activates the NG- RAN resources for MC data delivery as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].\n5.\tThe 5GC may send an MBS session update response to the MC service server indicating that the requested multicast MBS session has been activated as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].\nThe procedure shown in figure 7.3.3.4.3-1 presents the multicast MBS session activation procedure triggered by the MC service server.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tMC service clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to the same MC service group X.\n-\tThe MC service server has directly performed (or via NEF/MBSF) an MB-SMF discovery and selection, unless the corresponding information is locally configured.\n-\tA multicast MBS session is created and announced to address the corresponding MC service group with certain service requirements and optionally with a certain multicast service area.\n-\tThe MC service clients have already joined the multicast MBS session and are able to receive the MC data over the associated MBS session.\nFigure 7.3.3.4.3-1 illustrates the multicast MBS session deactivation procedure, which involves the MBS, SBS, and UE. The figure shows the process of deactivating a multicast session, including the steps of session deactivation request, session deactivation response, and session deactivation confirmation. The figure highlights the role of the MBS in managing the session and the interaction between the MBS and SBS, as well as the UE's response to the deactivation request. The figure is essential for understanding the process of session deactivation in a multicast MBS environment.\nFigure 7.3.3.4.3-1: Multicast MBS session deactivation procedure.\n1.\tThe group communication associated with MC service group X takes place, and the corresponding MC data is delivered over the associated multicast MBS session, hence the MBS session has an active state.\n2.\tThe MC service server decides to deactivate the multicast MBS session, as no further MC data to be delivered to the associated group, as the MC group call is over, and no further MC media is to be delivered.\n3.\tThe MC service server sends an MBS session update request towards the 5GC, either directly to the MB-SMF or via NEF/MBSF, indicating the MBS session ID to be deactivated as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].\n4.\tThe 5GC changes the MBS session state to \"inactive\" and deactivates the radio resources associated with the joined MC service UEs as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].\n5.\tThe 5GC may send an MBS session update response to the server indicating that the requested multicast MBS session has been inactivated as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].\nThe MC service server can decide to configure an MBS session per MC service group to transmit the media related to the corresponding MC service group communications. Such group communications can comprise different service requirements. For that, multicast and broadcast MBS sessions need to be configured with multiple MBS QoS flows to address different service requirements, e.g., different required QoS, provided by the MC service server. For instance, application-level control messages or media associated to a group communication can comprise different QoS requirements. Also, different type of group communications can comprise different QoS requirements, e.g., emergency group calls should be handled with a higher priority than normal group calls.\nThe configuration of multiple MBS QoS flows to address different service requirements is associated to the assignment of different streams (e.g., different ports) within an MBS session.\nThe established multicast MBS session can either be in active or inactive state, where the former indicates the activation of radio resources hence transmitting the MC media to the associated MC service group, and the latter indicates their deactivation as no MC media is being transmitted. The MC service server may trigger the activation of multicast MBS sessions once the MC service group is established and active, as well as once the MC media is available for transmission. For this purpose, the MC service server sends a multicast MBS session activation request towards the 5GC indicating the MBS session ID to be activated.\nSimilar to the use of eMBMS, the MC service server shall provide the associated information between a specific group communication and the stream to be used within an MBS session. This information could be sent in advance in an MBS session announcement or could be provided on demand in an additional signalling message for the MBS session, e.g., MapGroupToSessionStream (similar to the MapGroupToBearer in eMBMS).\nThe procedure in figure 7.3.3.5.2-1 describes how media related to a specific group communication can be distributed over a configured MBS session which consist of multiple QoS flows, i.e. addressing different service requirements. The procedure is applicable for both the pre-created MBS session case as described in clause 7.3.3.1.2 and the dynamic MBS session case as described in clause 7.3.3.1.3. For simplicity, the figure 7.3.3.5.2-1 shows that the MBS session is pre-created prior to the group communication establishment.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tMC service clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to the same MC service group X.\n-\tThe MC service server has decided to use an MBS session for MC service group communications associated to MC service group X.\nFigure 7.3.3.5.2 -1 illustrates the media transmission over Multi-Carrier (MC) service group sessions in a Mobile Broadband System (MBS) context. The figure depicts the process of data transmission through multiple carrier services, emphasizing the efficient use of spectrum resources. Key components include the MC service group, MBS sessions, and the underlying network infrastructure. The figure highlights the importance of carrier aggregation and resource allocation in delivering high-speed mobile broadband services.\nFigure 7.3.3.5.2-1: MC service group media transmission over MBS sessions\n1.\tThe MC service server creates a multicast or a broadcast MBS session targeting group communications associated to MC service group X, as being specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]. Therefore, the MC service server can provide default service requirements to be addressed by the MBS session, e.g. associated to MC 5QIs and specific allocation and retention priority (ARP) to transmit the media associated to MC service group communications.\nThe MBS session is announced and received by MC service client 2 to n. The MC service server has identified that MC service clients 2 to n can receive media over the MBS sessions, e.g. based on a notification from the MC service clients indicating the successful join of the multicast MBS session or a monitoring report of the broadcast MBS session (similar to the listening status report used for eMBMS).\n2.\tA new MC service group communication is established for the MC service group X consisting of a specific required QoS, e.g. an MC service emergency group communication. The group communication setup can be done over unicast.\n2a. For broadcast MBS sessions, the session is established upon sending a session start request as part of the MBS session creation procedure, which is described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].\n2b. For multicast MBS session, the session is established upon the acceptance of the first UE session join request initiated from the MC service UE towards the 5GS, as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]. The multicast session can then have either an active or an inactive state.\n3. \tThe MC service server may send a multicast MBS session activation request towards the 5GC in order to activate the multicast MBS session in case the session has an inactive state. For this purpose, the MC service server indicates the MBS session ID to be activated.\n4.\tConsidering that the established group communication requires a specific QoS, e.g. an MC service emergency group communication which requires higher priority (i.e. better ARP), the MC service server requests an MBS session update to the 5GS to provide the new required QoS, if not done during the MBS session creation in step 1. The MBS session should then be updated and an additional QoS flow may be configured.\n5.\tThe MC service server sends a MapGroupToSessionStream to MC service clients 2 to n over the configured MBS session providing the required stream information to receive the media related to the specific established MC service group communication within the MBS session.\n6.\tMC service clients process the MapGroupToSessionStream information to receive the related media over the specific MBS session stream.\n7.\tMC service client 1 sends media to the MC service server over unicast to be distributed for the established group communication.\n8.\tThe MC service server distributes the media to MC service clients 2 to n over the indicated stream within the established MBS session.\nNOTE:\tThe MC service server can stop the unicast delivery (if ongoing) towards the MC service clients considering the UE session join notification or the MBS listening status report.\n9.\tThe MC service server may send a multicast MBS session deactivation request towards the 5GC in order to deactivate the multicast MBS session. For this purpose, the MC service server indicates the MBS session ID to be deactivated.\n10.\tThe MC service server may further trigger the UE to leave multicast MBS session.\nThe MC service server may use an 5G MBS session for application level control signalling. An 5G bearer for application level control signalling is typically used for the purposes beyond the benefit for using 5G for resource efficiency, e.g. for improved MC service performance (KPIs), handling of high load scenarios.\nSimilar to the usage of eMBMS, both broadcast and multicast 5MBS session for application level control signalling may be used to transmit the following messages,\n-\tTransmission control (e.g. call setup and floor control)\n-\tMBS session announcement for media sessions\n-\tGroup application paging\n-\tGroup dynamic data (e.g. status of the group)\n-\tGroup state (e.g. emergency alerts)\nSimilar to the usage of eMBMS bearer in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3], 5G MBS session for application level control signalling is created in a service area that is larger than the estimated service for media MBS session. The service area for the media sessions is mainly based on counting of group members in each defined service area. The MBS session for application level control signalling is also created with a QoS that is better than MBS media session since the packet loss requirements are much stricter.\nThe MC service client shall not send responses to group-addressed application level control signalling unless instructed or configured to respond.\nThe procedure in figure 7.3.3.6.2-1 shows only one of the receiving MC service clients using an 5G MBS session.\nFigure 7.3.3.6.2 illustrates the utilization of 5G Massive MIMO base stations (MBS) for application-level control signaling. The figure showcases the network architecture, highlighting the role of the MBS in managing and controlling the communication between devices. Key components include the MBS, user equipment (UE), and the control signaling paths. The figure emphasizes the efficiency and flexibility of 5G networks in terms of control signaling, enabling advanced features and services for end-users.\nFigure 7.3.3.6.2-1: Use of 5G MBS for application-level control signalling\n1.\tThe MC service server determines to create MBS session for application-level control signalling, The creation of the 5G MBS session is done according to 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].\n2.\tThe MC service server passes the 5G MBS session info for the service description associated with the 5G MBS session to the MC service client. The MC service client obtains the MBS session ID, from the service description.\nNOTE:\tFor 5G MBS and 4G eMBMS co-existence, the eMBMS bearers activation and MBS session announcement are performed as specified in the procedure for pre-created MBS session and session announcement.\n3.\tThe MC service client stores the information associated with the MBS session ID. The MC service client uses the MBS session ID and other 5G MBS session related information to enable monitoring of the 5G MBS session by the MC service UE. In the case of multicast, UE may execute network layer multicast MBS joining as defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].\n4.\tSteps 4 to 6 defined in clause 7.3.3.1.2 are performed.\n5.\tThe MC service server transmits MC application control messages over the MBS session.\nThe motivation and principle of supporting Multi-server MBS session coordination is exactly similar to Multi-server eMBMS bearer coordination as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3].\nNOTE:\tThe procedures in clause 7.3.3.7.2 are only used when MBS session sharing between multiple MC service servers is required. It is implementation specific whether MBS session is shared amongst multiple MC service servers.\nThe procedure in this sub clause applies to both multicast and broadcast MBS session. The principle and pre-condition is similar with eMBMS bearer coordination as defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3].\nThis procedure is used when two or more MC service servers are serving users in the same area and are configured to share 5G MBS sessions for that specific area. The MC service servers may be of the same kind or different kind. The MC service servers are not participating in the same group call, which means that each MC service server transmit media independently of each other.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tAll MC service servers are configured with the contact information of those MC service servers that are configured to take the MBS session control role.\nFigure 7.3.3.7.2.1 illustrates the process of multiple server MBS procedures that are independent of media. The figure depicts the flow of data between servers and MBS, highlighting the use of independent procedures to ensure efficient and reliable communication. The figure showcases the importance of separating media-independent procedures from media-dependent procedures, which can help in improving the overall performance and reliability of the system.\nFigure 7.3.3.7.2.1-1: Multiple server MBS procedure independent of media.\n1.\tThe MC service server 1 evaluates whether MBS transmission is desired for each service area in which MC service group members are located, based upon the locations, affiliation status and other factors.\n2.\tThe MC service server 1 determines whether another MC service server has already established an MBS session with coverage for the MBS service area where MBS transmissions are desired. To do this, the MC service server 1 consults a pre-configured list of MC service servers and sends them a discover MBS session request. This request may be sent to several MC service servers.\nNOTE:\tMC service servers of the same type can be configured to discover MBS sessions from a single server. The single server then becomes a centralized entity for MBS session control for the MC service. Similarly, all MC service servers of all types can be configured to discover MBS sessions from a single server. The single server then becomes a centralized MBS session controller for all MC services.\n3.\tThe MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) responds with a discover MBS session response indicating whether there is an MBS session available in the specific MBS service area with the requested bandwidth. The discover MBS session response message includes the MBS session ID of the MBS session that is shared between the MC service servers. If the MBS session of interest has insufficient bandwidth, the polling MC service server 1 may resort to unicast, or may allocate another MBS session for the congested area. If a duplicate MBS session is allocated for the same area, the MBS session should not be shared with other servers and may be torn down as soon as the congestion on the original MBS session clears up, in order to conserve resources.\nFor any MBS service areas not covered by another MC service server, the MC service server 1 prepares to distribute media to those MBS service areas by setting up an MBS session. The MBS session set up by the MC service server 1 may then become available for other MC service servers (controlling role) for other MC service groups.\n4.\t4a.The MC service server 1 performs the MBS session announcement towards MC client 1, as well as MBS notification handling, according to the relevant procedures specified in this specification. In case of multicast MBS sessions, the MC service UE subsequently initiates a UE session join towards 5GC, and may send a UE session join notification to MC service server 1 indicating it has successfully joined the multicast MBS session under consideration.\n4.b If the MC service server 2 is authorized to receive MBS related location information from the users utilizing the services from MC service server 1, the MC service server 2 may optionally do the MBS session announcement and handling of the notifications on behalf of MC service server 1. The notifications shall in this case be sent to both MC service server 1 and MC service server 2. In case of multicast MBS sessions, the MC service UE subsequently initiates a UE session join towards 5GC, and may send a UE session join notification to MC service server 2.\n5.\tThe MC service server 1 sends a media distribution request to the MC service server 2 (MBS session control role). The media distribution request is sent to reserve the specified capacity in the MBS session.\n6.\tMC service server 2 (MBS session control role) sends a media distribution response to the MC service server 1 indicating whether the request can be supported and supplies details about the MBS session.\n7.\tThe MC service server 1 establishes a group communication session via the MBS session, informing MBS session connected MC service clients 1 and 2 that a group communication session is about to start on the MBS session. This step is equivalent to MapGroupToSessionStream.\n8.\tMC service client 2 sends media on the uplink to the MC service server 1.\n9.\tThe MC service server 1 forwards the media to MC service server 2 (MBS session control role).\n10.\tThe MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) distributes the media to MC service client 1 with MBS capabilities over the MBS session.\n11.\tThe MC service server 1 sends a media distribution release request, informing the MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) to request the MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) to release the capacity that was reserved in step 5.\n12.\tThe MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) responds to the request by sending a media distribution release response.\nThe procedure in this subclause applies to both multicast MBS session and broadcast MBS session.\nThe principle is similar to eMBMS bearer coordination within one group call as the following:\n-\tIt may be used when two MC service servers are serving users in the same area and are configured to share MBS sessions for that specific area. The MC service servers are of the same kind, and the MC service servers may participate in the same group call, and by that have a need to deliver the same content.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tAll MC service servers are configured with the contact information of those MC service servers that are configured to take the MBS session control role.\nFigure 7.3.3.7.2.2 -1 illustrates the procedure for multiple server MBS within one group call, showcasing the establishment of a call between two users and the involvement of multiple base stations (MBS) to ensure seamless communication. The figure depicts the synchronization of the call through the use of signaling protocols, with each MBS taking on a specific role in managing the call resources. The figure emphasizes the importance of efficient resource allocation and coordination among base stations to maintain call quality and reliability.\nFigure 7.3.3.7.2.2-1: Multiple server MBS procedure within one group call\n1.\tThe MC service server 1 evaluates whether MBS based transmission is desired for each service area in which MC service group members are located, based upon the locations, affiliation status and other factors.\n2.\tThe MC service server 1 determines whether another MC service server has already established an MBS session with coverage for the MBS service area where MBS based transmission is desired. To do this, the MC service server 1 consults a pre-configured list of MC service servers and sends them a discover MBS session request. This request may be sent to several MC service servers.\nNOTE 1:\tMC service servers of the same type can be configured to discover MBS sessions from a single server. The single server then becomes a centralized entity for MBS session control for the MC service. Similarly, all MC service servers of all types can be configured to discover MBS sessions from a single server. The single server then becomes a centralized MBS session controller for all MC services.\n3.\tThe MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) responds with a discover MBS session response indicating whether there is an MBS session available in the specific MBS service area with the requested bandwidth. The discover MBS session response message includes the ID of the MBS session that is shared between the MC service servers. If the MBS session of interest has insufficient bandwidth, the polling MC service server 1 may resort to unicast, or may allocate another MBS session for the congested area. If a duplicate MBS session is allocated for the same area, the MBS session should not be shared with other servers and may be torn down as soon as the congestion on the original MBS session clears up, in order to conserve resources.\nFor any MBS service areas not covered by another MC service server, the MC service server 1 prepares to distribute media to those MBS service areas by setting up a MBS session. The MBS session created by the MC service server 1 may then become available for other MC service servers (controlling role) for other MC service groups.\n4a.\tThe MC service server 1 performs the MBS session announcement as well as the MBS listening reporting according to the relevant procedures specified in this specification. In case of multicast MBS sessions, the MC service UE(s) subsequently initiate a UE session join towards 5GC, and may send a UE session join notification to MC service server 1 indicating it has successfully joined the multicast MBS session under consideration.\n4b.\tIf the MC service server 2 is authorized to receive MBS related location information from the users utilizing the services from MC service server 1, the MC service server 2 may optionally do the MBS session announcement and handling the listening reports on behalf of MC service server 1. Listening reports shall in this case be sent to both MC service server 1 and MC service server 2. In case of multicast MBS sessions, the MC service UE(s) subsequently initiate a UE session join towards 5GC, and may send a UE session join notification to MC service server 2.\nNOTE 2:\tSteps 1-4 are also performed by MC service server 3, but is not shown in the procedure to make it easier to read.\n5.\tThe MC service client 2 initiates a group call that is subject for MBS transmission. In this scenario there are more than one MC service server (i.e., MC service server 1 and MC service server 3) that serve MC service clients that are affiliated to the group, and by that should receive the media in the group call.\n6a.\tThe MC service server 1 sends a media distribution request to the MC service server 2 (MBS session control role). The media distribution request includes the MC group identifier. This indicates that the media distribution request is used for this specific group call.\n6b.\tThe MC service server 3 sends a media distribution request to the MC service server 2 (MBS session control role). The media distribution request includes the MC group identifier. This indicates that the media distribution request is used for this specific group call.\n7a.\tThe MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) sends a media distribution response to the MC service server 1 indicating whether the request can be supported and supplies details about the MBS session. This also includes details on which media stream should be used for transmitting the media on the MBS session. This information is used in the MapGroupToSessionStream message sent by the MC service server when setting up the group call.\n7b.\tThe MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) sends a media distribution response to the MC service server 3 indicating that the group call is already transmitted on the MBS session by another MC service server. Based on the information, the MC service server 3 could decide to not transmit media if media is already transmitted.\n8a.\tThe media is sent from the MC service client 2 to MC service server 1, which is the participating server for the MC service group of the group call.\n8b.\tThe media is forwarded to all MC service servers that are serving users that take part in the group call.\nNOTE 3:\tThe figure above does not visualize the participating server for the MC service group and controlling server for the MC service group. The media is sent to all participating servers for the MC service group which are the servers that decide on unicast or MBS transmission.\n9.\tThe MC service server 1 forwards the media to MC service server 2 (MBS session control role).\n10.\tThe MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) distributes the media to MC service client 1 with MBS capabilities via MBS session.\n11.\tThe MC service server 1 sends a media distribution release request, to request the MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) to release the capacity that was reserved in step 5. The media distribution release request shall only be sent when the group call is terminated.\n12.\tThe MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) responds to the request by sending a media distribution release response.\nThis clause addresses the issue of MC service media delivery over MBS session, specifically, to maintain the service continuity when switching between 5G MBS delivery and unicast delivery.\nThe MC service client reports the broadcast reception quality to the MC service server which is used to make the decision whether to use the unicast delivery to the MC service UE(s) which are suffering bad broadcast reception quality due to e.g., move out of the broadcast service area.\nAn MC service client monitors the broadcast MBS session to receive MC service media. Based on the received quality (e.g., radio level quality, RTP packet loss), the MC service client needs to inform the MC service server that the MC service client is able to receive the MC service media on the broadcast MBS session with sufficient quality or not.\nThis estimation of the broadcast reception quality may be dependent on, for example, the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and measurements from the reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), RTP packet loss, BLER of the received media.\nThe procedure in figure 7.3.3.8.2.2.1-1 illustrates the UE which is receiving media via broadcast MBS session is switched to unicast delivery because the UE suffers from bad broadcast reception quality due to e.g., moving out of the broadcast service area. It shows only one of the receiving MC service clients receiving the broadcast MBS session.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MC group communication is ongoing and the MC service media (e.g., DL media, application layer control signalling) is transmitted via broadcast MBS session.\n2.\tThe MC service client is receiving the MC service media (e.g., DL media, application layer control signalling) via the broadcast MBS session.\n3.\tThe MC service client(s) already have the associated information (e.g., SDP) to receive the unicast delivery during the group communication establishment phase.\nFigure 7.3.3.8.2.1 -1: Service continuity from broadcast to unicast illustrates the process of transitioning from a broadcast transmission to a unicast transmission, ensuring that services remain uninterrupted during this change. The figure depicts the network infrastructure, including the source, intermediate nodes, and destination, highlighting the steps taken to maintain service continuity. This includes the use of multicast trees and unicast routing protocols, which are essential for maintaining the quality of service in a network. The figure also shows how traffic is efficiently managed and how resources are allocated to ensure that the service remains uninterrupted.\nFigure 7.3.3.8.2.2.1-1: Service continuity from broadcast to unicast\n1.\tAn MC service group communication session is ongoing and the DL media is transmitted over broadcast MBS session.\n2.\tThe MC service client detects that it suffers bad broadcast reception due to e.g., moving out of the broadcast service area of the announced MBS session ID (i.e., TMGI). The MC service client may determine the broadcast reception quality by using the BLER of the received media. When no media is received, the quality estimation can consider the reference signals and the modulation and coding scheme (MCS).\n3.\tThe MC service client sends MBS listening status report which indicates the broadcast reception quality associated with the MBS session ID is not sufficient to receive media. The MC service client may also map the determined broadcast reception quality to a broadcast reception quality level. The broadcast reception quality level indicates at which specific broadcast reception quality level the MC service media has been received.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is implementation that the broadcast reception quality level can be determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS flow level via e.g., measurements of radio level signalling such as the reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), packet loss.\nNOTE 2:\tThe set of MBS reception quality levels and the mapping of the determined broadcast reception quality to those levels are implementation.\nNOTE 3:\tThe frequency of MC service UE sending listening reports can be limited to prevent signalling congestion. E.g., the MC service UE can stop monitoring the broadcast reception quality and send the MBS listening status report only once when it moves outside of the broadcast service area.\n4.\tThe MC service server based on the report from the participant, determines that the UE is not able to receive the media or the QoS requirements is not satisfied. The MC service server determines to send the MC service media (e.g., DL media, application layer control signalling) via the unicast delivery to the reported MC service client.\n5.\tIf the unicast QoS flow is not satisfied, the MC service server interacts with the 5GC to update the QoS requirements.\n6.\tThe MC service server sends the MC service media via the unicast delivery towards the MC service client which suffers bad broadcast reception quality.\n7.\tThe MC service client then receives the DL MC service via both broadcast MBS session and unicast delivery.\nThe procedure in figure 7.3.3.8.2.2.2-1 illustrates the UE receiving media via unicast delivery being switched to broadcast MBS session as the UE enters the broadcast service area where the NG-RAN is broadcasting the MC service media of the ongoing group communication. The MC service client now is able to receive the broadcast media. Only one of the receiving MC service clients receiving the broadcast MBS session is shown.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MC group communication is ongoing and the MC service media (e.g., DL media, application layer control signalling) is transmitted via broadcast MBS session in the broadcast service areas.\n2.\tThe MC service client is receiving the MC service media (e.g., DL media, application layer control signalling) via the unicast delivery.\n3.\tThe MC service client has already received the broadcast MBS session announcement, MapGroupToSessionStream information and enters the broadcast service area.\nFigure 7.3.3.8.2.2. 2 - 1 illustrates the service continuity from unicast to broadcast, showcasing the transition of data transmission from a single recipient to a group of recipients. The figure depicts the process of data packet forwarding, starting from the source node, passing through intermediate nodes, and reaching the destination node. The transition from unicast to broadcast is marked by the change in the data packet's path, highlighting the importance of efficient data forwarding mechanisms in maintaining service continuity.\nFigure 7.3.3.8.2.2.2-1: Service continuity from unicast to broadcast.\n1.\tAn MC service group communication session is ongoing and the broadcast MBS session is used to deliver the MC service media of the group communication. The MC service client is receiving the MC service media via the unicast delivery.\n2.\tThe MC service client detects that it is able to receive the broadcast media due to e.g., moving into the broadcast service area of the announced MBS session ID. The MC service client may determine the broadcast reception quality by using the BLER of the received media. When no media is received, the quality estimation can consider the reference signals and the modulation and coding scheme (MCS).\n3.\tThe MC service client sends MBS listening status report which indicates the broadcast reception quality associated with the MBS session ID is sufficient to receive media. The MC service client may also map the determined broadcast reception quality to a broadcast reception quality level. The broadcast reception quality level indicates at which specific broadcast reception quality level the MC service media has been received.\nNOTE 1:\tThe set of MBS reception quality levels and the mapping of the determined broadcast reception quality to those levels are implementation.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is implementation that the broadcast reception quality level can be determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS flow level via e.g., measurements of radio level signals, such as the reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), or packet loss.\n4.\tBased on the MapGroupToSessionStream received before, the MC service client receives the DL MC service via both the broadcast MBS session and the unicast delivery.\nNOTE 3:\tIf any information about the broadcast MBS session stream has changed, the MC service server provides the MapGroupToSessionStream again.\n5.\tThe MC service server, based on the report from the participant, determines to stop sending the MC service media (e.g., DL media, application layer control signalling) via the unicast delivery to the reporting MC service client. After then, the MC service client receives the MC service media only via the broadcast MBS session.\n7.3.3.8.3.1\tGeneral\nThe MC service server may also switch between multicast and unicast by utilizing application layer mechanisms similar to switching between broadcast and unicast as specified in clause 7.3.3.8.2. If indicated in the MBS session announcement information, the MC service client reports the monitoring state (i.e., the reception quality of the MBS session) back to the MC service server.\nNOTE:\tOnce the MC service UE has successfully joined the multicast MBS session and started to receive the MC service media via the multicast MBS session, then the network mechanism specified in TS 23.247 [15] will deliver the media from the MC service server via the 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery method or the 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery method towards the MC service UE(s). The usage of 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery method or the 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery method is transparent to the MC service server.\nThe MC service communications over 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay is supported for unicast delivery.\nNOTE:\tIn this release of the specification, service continuity is supported for unicast PDU session over 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay, however it is not yet supported for multicast/broadcast MBS sessions for MC service communications.\nThe path switch procedures for MC service communications between MBS session and 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay is specified in this clause.\nThe architecture of MC service utilizing IMS service continuity is specified in Annex B.\nThis clause describes the procedures for path switch from MBS session to a 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay.\nFigure 7.3.3.8.4.2-1 illustrates the path switch procedure from MBS session to a 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay.\nFigure 7.3.3.8.4.2 -1 illustrates the path switch from the Mobile Base Station (MBS) session to a 5G ProSe User Equipment (UE) to network relay, showcasing the transition of the session from the MBS to the network. The figure highlights the role of the ProSe UE in facilitating communication between the MBS and the network, emphasizing the importance of this relay in 5G ProSe communication.\nFigure 7.3.3.8.4.2-1: Path switch from MBS session to a 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay.\n1.\tThe DL media is transmitted over an MBS session to a (remote) MC service client.\n2.\tThe MC service client sends an MBS listening status report indicating that the MBS reception quality associated with the MBS session ID is not sufficient to receive media. The MC service client may also map the determined MBS reception quality to an MBS reception quality level. The MBS reception quality level indicates at which specific MBS reception quality level the MC service media has been received.\n3.\tThe MC service server based on the report from the MC service client determines that the (remote) MC service UE is unable to receive the media or the QoS requirements are not satisfied. The MC service server determines to send the MC service communications (e.g., DL media, application layer control signalling) via the unicast delivery to the reported MC service client.\n4.\tThe MC service server sends the DL media to the (remote) MC service UE over a unicast PDU session.\nNOTE 1:\tSteps 2 to 4 may occur after step 6 if the MBS listening status report towards the MC service server has failed due to connection lost.\n5.\tThe remote MC service UE discovers and utilizes a 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay UE in its proximity once it has detected being out of the network coverage. This step applies to both 5G ProSe Layer-3 and Layer-2 UE-to-network relay.\nNOTE 2:\tAn NG-RAN based measurement report triggers the remote MC service UE to perform a 5G Prose UE-to-Network relay discovery over PC5, as indicated in 3GPP TS 38.331 [19]. The remote MC service UE establishes a secure point-to-point link with the relay UE in its proximity over PC5. As part of this process the remote MC service UE is mutually authenticated at PC5 layer with either the relay or with the network as specified in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17].\n6.\tFor the case of 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-network relay without the support of N3IWF, as described in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17], the remote MC service client performs SIP re-registration over the relay UE due to the change in IP address of the remote MC service UE and initiates IMS service continuity procedures as described in Annex B.\nNOTE 3:\tFor the case of 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network relay with the support of N3IWF, the relay UE performs registration and authentication procedures towards the 5GC to support the remote MC service UE with an end-to-end confidentiality and IP address reservation requirements, as described in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17].\nNOTE 4:\tFor the case of 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-network relay, the 5GC can provide the service continuity for the remote MC service UE with the UE's original IP address, as described in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17].\n7.\tThe MC service server sends the MC service communications using the unicast delivery via the 5G ProSe MC service UE-to-Network relay UE towards the remote MC service client. The MC service client then receives the DL MC service communication via the relay UE.\nThis clause describes the procedure for path switch from a 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay to MBS session.\nFigure 7.3.3.8.4.3-1 illustrates path switch from a 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay to MBS session.\nFigure 7.3.3.8.4.3-1 illustrates the path switch from a 5G ProSe User Equipment (UE) to a network relay, leading to a Mobile Base Station (MBS) session. The figure showcases the role of the path switch in managing and optimizing the communication between the UE and the MBS, ensuring a seamless and efficient connection. The path switch plays a crucial part in directing the signal through the network, taking into account factors such as signal strength, latency, and available resources. This helps in maintaining the quality of service for the MBS session and supports the overall performance of the 5G ProSe network.\nFigure 7.3.3.8.4.3-1 Path switch from a 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay to MBS session.\n1.\tThe remote MC service client is receiving the MC service media using the unicast delivery via a 5G ProSe UE-to-Network relay UE. This step applies to both 5G ProSe Layer 3 and Layer 2 UE-to-network relay.\n2.\tBased on the (remote) MC service UE`s path selection policies described in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17], and once the NG-RAN based measurement report discussed in 3GPP TS 38.331 [19] is triggered due to network coverage detection,the (remote) MC service UE connects to the network via the Uu-interface.\nNOTE 1:\tThe path selection policies may be pre-configured in the MC service UE or provided by the PCF, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17].\n3.\tFor the case of 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-network relay without the support of N3IWF, the (remote) MC service client performs SIP re-registration over Uu and initiates the IMS service continuity procedures as described in Annex B. Further, the MC service server sends MC service communications using unicast delivery which traverses over Uu to the remote MC service client.\nNOTE 2:\tFor the case of 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-network relay via the support of N3IWF, the (remote) MC service UE performs registration procedures towards the 5GS to establish the necessary resources over the Uu-interface.\nNOTE 3:\tFor the case of 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-network relay, the 5GC can provide the service continuity for the (remote) MC service UE with the UE's original IP address, as described in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17].\n4.\tThe MC service client receives the MC service communication over a unicast PDU session.\n5.\tOptionally, the MC service server may send the MBS session announcement to the (remote) MC service client with the information of the MBS session.\nNOTE 4:\tThe information of the MBS session can be available at the (remote) MC service client due to a previous MC service signalling via the relay UE.\n6a.\tIf a multicast MBS session has been announced, the MC service UE performs a UE session join towards the 5GC using the MBS session information, and the MC service client may send a UE session join notification towards the server.\n6b.\tIf a broadcast MBS session has been announced, the MC service client start monitoring the reception quality of the broadcast MBS session.\n7.\tThe MC service client sends an MBS listening status report which indicates the MBS reception quality associated with the MBS session ID is sufficient to receive media.\nNOTE 4:\tIt is implementation specific whether the MBS session reception quality level is determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS flow level via e.g., measurements of radio level signalling such as the reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), packet loss.\n8.\tBased on the report received from MC service client in step 7, the MC service server determines to stop sending the MC service communications (e.g., DL media, application layer control signalling) using the unicast delivery. Further, the MC server sends the MC service communications via the MBS session.\n9.\tThe MC service client receives the MC service communications from the MC service server via the MBS session.\nWhen working in transport only mode, the MC service server guides the MC service clients throughout the MC media transmission for switching between the LTE and 5G systems. For this purpose, the location management client sends location related information to the location management server, similar to the one defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3], which is triggered due to its location change – in this case due to Radio Access Technology (RAT) change, to inform the server hence the latter provides guidance related to how to receive the MC services after the location update.\nThe procedures cover both the deployment scenarios with/without MBSF/MBSTF. The procedures specify four inter-system switching related scenarios as follows:\n1.\tInter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE eMBMS bearer, as in 7.3.3.9.2\n2.\tInter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE unicast bearer, as in 7.3.3.9.3\n3.\tInter-system switching from LTE eMBMS to 5G MBS session, as in 7.3.3.9.4\n4.\tInter-system switching from LTE eMBMS to 5G unicast PDU session, as in 7.3.3.9.5\nIn all the inter-system switching related scenario described in 7.3.3.9.2, 7.3.3.9.3, 7.3.3.9.4 and 7.3.3.9.5, the functional entity that resides in 5GS may be NEF, or MBSF, or MB-SMF for session creation and together with PCF or PCC related interaction.\nNOTE:\tThere will be a service interrupt when the MC service server performs path switch between 5G and LTE bearers or sessions.\nThe procedure provided in figure 7.3.3.9.2-1 describes how the MC service server handles inter-system switching when the MC service UE switches from 5G to LTE network, where the MC service server is able to provide the MC services to the clients over eMBMS bearer(s).\nPre-conditions:\n-\tMC service clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to the same MC service group X.\n-\tThe MC services can be provided via both 5GS and EPS.\n-\tThe MC service client(s) is within the eMBMS service area.\n-\tIt is assumed that the MC service client(s) has not received the eMBMS bearer announcement while camping in 5GS.\n\nFigure 7.3.3.9.2 illustrates the inter-system switching process from a 5G Multi-Band Spectrum (MBS) session to an LTE e MBMS bearer. The figure depicts the transition of the 5G session to an LTE e MBMS bearer, highlighting the key components involved, such as the 5G Multi-Band Spectrum (MBS) session, the LTE e MBMS bearer, and the inter-system switching mechanism. The figure also shows the signaling and control plane interactions between the 5G and LTE networks, ensuring a seamless and efficient handover. This process is crucial for maintaining service continuity and providing a high-quality user experience across different network domains.\nFigure 7.3.3.9.2-1: Inter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE eMBMS bearer.\n1.\tAn MC service group communication takes place, and the MC media is delivered over 5G MBS session (either broadcast or multicast session mode), which is associated to the MC service group X.\n2.\tThe MC service UE performs handover to EPS.\n3.\tLocation information handling can be based on location reports provided by the MC service client, where the MC service UE`s location information is provided via the location management client, triggered by RAT change, to the location management server, where the latter provides the location information to the MC service server.\nAlso, location information handling can be based on notifications provided from the network to the MC service server related to 5GS supporting EPS interworking, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7], 3GPP TS 23.502 [10], and 3GPP TS 23.503 [9] and described in clause 7.4.3. For that, the MC service server can subscribe to receive notifications of specific events from the network. For instance, the MC service server can subscribe to PCF related notifications (via N5 or Rx) for specific events, e.g., access network information notification and change of access type. Also, when SCEF+NEF is deployed, the MC service server can subscribe to SCEF+NEF related notifications for specific events, e.g., core network (CN) type change.\n4.\tThe MC service server analyses the location information and decides how to serve the client. If the MC service server decides to serve the client via eMBMS bearer, it may send an eMBMS bearer announcement as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3]. This step is optional as the bearer announcement related information could be sent in advance (implementation specific).\n5.\tIf not already available, the MC service client stores the announced TMGI(s), service area, and any relevant information to the eMBMS, which is delivered via the bearer announcement. As a result, the MC service client starts monitoring the bearer.\n6.\tThe MC service client sends an eMBMS listening status report to inform the server of its ability of receiving MC media over the specified bearer.\n7.\tThe MC server sends the necessary information related to receiving the MC media in the form of the MapGroupToBearer.\n8.\tThe MC service group communication takes place over EPS, and the MC media is transmitted over an eMBMS bearer.\nThe procedure provided in figure 7.3.3.9.3-1 describes how the MC service server handles inter-system switching when the MC service UE switches from 5G to LTE network, where the MC service server is unable to provide the MC services to the client over eMBMS bearer.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tMC service clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to the same MC service group X.\n-\tThe MC services can be provided via both 5GS and EPS.\nFigure 7.3.3.9.3 illustrates the inter-system switching process from a 5G Multi-Band Small Cell (MBS) session to an LTE Unicast bearer. The figure depicts the transition from a 5G network to an LTE network, highlighting the seamless handover of sessions between the two systems. The figure shows the MBS session being transferred to an LTE Unicast bearer, with the 5G and LTE networks seamlessly integrated. The figure also shows the signaling and control mechanisms used to manage the handover process, ensuring a smooth transition between the two networks.\nFigure 7.3.3.9.3-1: Inter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE unicast bearer.\n1.\tAn MC service group communication takes place, and the MC media is delivered over 5G MBS session (either broadcast or multicast session mode), which is associated to the MC service group X.\n2.\tThe MC service UE performs handover to EPS.\n3.\tLocation information handling can be based on location reports provided by the MC service client, where the MC service UE`s location information is provided via the location management client, triggered by RAT change, to the location management server, where the latter provides the location information to the MC service server.\nAlso, location information handling can be based on notifications provided from the network to the MC service server related to 5GS supporting EPS interworking, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7], 3GPP TS 23.502 [10], and 3GPP TS 23.503 [9] and described in clause 7.4.3.

Also, when SCEF+NEF is deployed, the MC service server can subscribe to SCEF+NEF related notifications for specific events, e.g. core network (CN) type change.\n4.\tThe MC service server may interact with the EPC for providing the required media resources over the unicast bearer, if not already allocated.\n5.\tThe MC service group communication takes place over EPS, and the MC media is transmitted over a unicast bearer.\nThe procedure provided in figure 7.3.3.9.4-1 describes how the MC service server handles inter-system switching when the MC service UE switches from LTE network to 5G, where the MC service server is able to provide the MC services to the client over 5G MBS sessions (either broadcast or multicast).\nPre-conditions:\n-\tMC service clients are attached to the EPC and affiliated to the same MC service group X.\n-\tThe MC services can be provided via both 5GS and EPS.\n-\tThe MC service client(s) is within the service area (if the session is limited to an area), where the MBS session is configured.\n-\tIt is assumed that the MC service client(s) has not received the 5G MBS session announcement while camping in EPS.\n\nFigure 7.3.3.9.4 illustrates the inter-system switching process from an LTE e MBMS bearer to 5G MBS sessions, either in a broadcast or multicast mode. The figure depicts the transition from the legacy LTE network to the new 5G network, highlighting the seamless handover of media broadcast sessions. The diagram showcases the role of the eMBMS bearer, which is the foundation for the migration, and the 5G MBS sessions that will replace it. The figure also emphasizes the importance of maintaining a high level of service continuity during the transition, ensuring that users experience minimal disruption.\nFigure 7.3.3.9.4-1: Inter-system switching from LTE eMBMS bearer to 5G MBS sessions (either broadcast or multicast).\n1.\tAn MC service group communication takes place, and the MC media is delivered over eMBMS bearer, which is associated to the MC service group X.\n2.\tThe MC service UE performs handover to 5GS.\n3.\tLocation information handling can be based on location reports provided by the MC service client, where the MC service UE`s location information is provided via the location management client, triggered by RAT change, to the location management server, where the latter provides the location information to the MC service server.\nAlso, location information handling can be based on notifications provided from the network to the MC service server related to 5GS supporting EPS interworking, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7], 3GPP TS 23.502 [10], and 3GPP TS 23.503 [9] and described in clause 7.4.3.

If the MC service server decides to serve the client via 5G MBS session, it may send an MBS session announcement indicating information among others the session mode to serve the MC service client and the corresponding MBS session ID. This step is optional as the session announcement related information could be sent in advance (implementation specific).\n5.\tThe MC service UE acts according to the MBS session mode provided to receive the DL media.\n5a.\tIn case of multicast MBS sessions, the MC service UE performs a UE session join towards the 5GC indicating the MBS session ID to join. It may as well send a UE session join acknowledgement to the MC service server.\n5b.\tIn case of broadcast MBS sessions, the MC service UE starts monitoring the broadcast MBS session.\n6.\tThe MC service client sends an MBS listening status report to the server indicating its ability to receive media over the indicated MBS session.\n7.\tThe MC service server sends a MapGroupToSessionStream over the MBS session providing the required stream information to receive the media related to the group communication.\n8.\tThe MC service client processes the received information related to the MC media over the MBS session.\n9.\tThe MC service group communication takes place over 5GS, and the MC media is delivered over the broadcast or multicast MBS session.\nThe procedure provided in figure 7.3.3.9.5-1 describes how the MC service server handles inter-system switching when the MC service UE switches from LTE network to 5G, where the MC service server is able to provide the MC services to the client over 5G MBS sessions (either broadcast or multicast).\nPre-conditions:\n-\tMC service clients are attached to the EPC and affiliated to the same MC service group X.\n-\tThe MC services can be provided via both 5GS and EPS.\nFigure 7.3.3.9.5 illustrates the inter-system switching process from an LTE e MBMS bearer to a 5G unicast PDU session. The figure depicts the transition of the bearer from the LTE network to the 5G network, highlighting the key components involved, such as the eMBMS bearer and the unicast PDU session. The figure also shows the signaling and control mechanisms that enable this seamless transition, ensuring a smooth and efficient handover between the two systems.\nFigure 7.3.3.9.5-1: Inter-system switching from LTE eMBMS bearer to 5G unicast PDU session.\n1.\tAn MC service group communication takes place, and the MC media is delivered over eMBMS bearer, which is associated to the MC service group X.\n2.\tThe MC service UE performs handover to 5GS.\n3.\tLocation information handling can be based on location reports provided by the MC service client, where the MC service UE`s location information is provided via the location management client, triggered by RAT change, to the location management server, where the latter provides the location information to the MC service server.\nAlso, location information handling can be based on notifications provided from the network to the MC service server related to 5GS supporting EPS interworking, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7], 3GPP TS 23.502 [10], and 3GPP TS 23.503 [9] and described in clause 7.4.3.

One MBS session may be not permanently associated to one specific group or group call.\nNOTE:\tIt is implementation-specific that one MBS session can be re-assigned to different groups, or is associated to only one group.\nThe procedure in clause 7.3.3.10.2 requires that the group session is setup before the media transmission starts.

The diagram highlights the use of multicast MBS for efficient data transmission and the role of the MG in managing the call sessions. The figure emphasizes the importance of efficient call setup and management in modern telecommunication networks.\nFigure 7.3.3.10.2.2.1-1: Group call connect over broadcast and multicast MBS sessions.\n1.\tAn MBS session is configured with the required QoS requirements announced and established.\nNOTE:\tIn case of broadcast MBS sessions, the session is established as part of session configuration procedures as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]. In case of multicast MBS sessions, the session is established as specified in step 2.\n2.\tIn the case of multicast MBS sessions, the MCPTT UE initiates a UE session join towards the 5GS, based on the session information provided to the MCPTT UE during the session announcement step. This step is essential in order to receive the corresponding MC media. The multicast MBS session is hence established once the first initiated UE session join is accepted as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].\n3.\tMCPTT client 1 initiates a group call by sending an initial floor request over a unicast PDU session towards the MCPTT server.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server sends a MapGroupToSessionStream including the necessary stream information for the MCPTT clients 2 to n to receive the MC media related to the group call which is taken place within the associated MBS session.\n5.\tThe MCPTT clients 2 to n process the MapGroupToSessionStream information and may send a MapGroupToSessionStream Ack back to the MCPTT server if required.\n6.\tThe MCPTT server grants MCPTT client 1 the right to transmit media over the associated MBS session and sends a floor granted message to client 1 over a unicast PDU session.\n7.\tA floor taken message is sent from the MCPTT server to MCPTT clients 2 to n indicating the MCPTT ID of the transmitting client, i.e., MCPTT client 1 and the associated MCPTT group ID.

Prior to group session setup, the MBS session is activated and announced to the MCData clients.\nThe procedure specified in this clause is applicable (for the group communication establishment) for Group standalone short data service using media plane as described in clause 7.4.2.6 in 3GPP TS 23.282 [5] and for Group short data service session as described in clause 7.4.2.7 in 3GPP TS 23.282 [5].\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe MCData clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to the same MCData group X.\n-\tThe MCData server has directly performed (or via NEF/MBSF) an MB-SMF discovery and selection, unless the corresponding information is locally configured.\n-\tThe MCData server has decided to use an MBS session for the MCData service group communication associated with to the MCData group X.\nFigure 7.3.3.12.4.2 .1 -1: Group communication connect over broadcast and multicast MBS sessions illustrates a network topology where group communication is facilitated through a combination of broadcast and multicast Medium-Buffered Sockets (MBS) sessions. The figure showcases the various nodes and links involved, including the Medium Access Control (MAC) sublayer, the Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer, and the Network Layer (NLP) sublayer. The diagram emphasizes the efficient use of network resources and the distribution of communication among different nodes, ensuring reliable and high-speed data transmission within the network.\nFigure 7.3.3.12.4.2.1-1: Group communication connect over broadcast and multicast MBS sessions.\n1.\tAn MBS session is configured with the required QoS requirements announced and established.\nNOTE 1:\tIn case of broadcast MBS sessions, the session is established as part of session configuration procedures as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]. In case of multicast MBS sessions, the session is established as specified in step 2.\n2.\tIn the case of multicast MBS sessions, the MCData UE initiates a UE session join towards the 5GS based on the session information provided to the MCData UE during the session announcement step. This step 2 is essential in order to receive the corresponding MC media. The multicast MBS session is hence established once the first initiated UE session join is accepted as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].\n3.\tThe MCData client 1 initiates a group communication by sending a MCData group data request over a unicast PDU session towards the MCData server.\n4.\tMCData server initiates the MCData group data request towards each MCData clients 2 to n.\n5.\tThe receiving MCData clients 2 to n optionally notify the user about the incoming MCData session data request.\n6.\tThe receiving MCData client 2 to n accept or reject the MCData group data request and the corresponding result is in the MCData group data response towards MCData server.\n7.\tThe MCData server sends a MapGroupToSessionStream including the necessary stream information for the MCData clients 2 to n to receive the MC data related to the group communication which is taken place within the associated MBS session.\n8.\tThe MCData clients 2 to n process the MapGroupToSessionStream information and may send a MapGroupToSessionStream Ack back to the MCData server if required.\n9.\tMCData server forwards the MCData group data response received from MCData client 2 to n to the MCData user initiating the MCData session data request.\nNOTE 2:\tThe steps 4 to 6 and steps 7 to 8 can occur in any order, and prior to step 10 depending on the conditions to proceed with the data transmission.\n10.\tMCData client 1 sends the MC data over uplink unicast PDU session towards the MCData server.\n11.\tThe MCData server sends the MC data over the indicated stream within the associated MBS session to the MCData clients 2 to n.\nFigure 7.3.3.12.4.2.2-1 presents the procedure for a group communication disconnect over broadcast and multicast MBS sessions.\nFigure 7.3.3.12.4 . 2. 2 -1: Group communication disconnect over broadcast and multicast MBS sessions. This telecommunication figure illustrates the process of group communication disconnect over broadcast and multicast Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBS) sessions. The figure shows the various stages of the process, including the initial connection, the transmission of data, and the eventual disconnection. The figure also shows the role of the Media Independent Call Control (MICC) protocol in managing the communication between the different devices. The figure is a valuable resource for understanding the intricacies of group communication in a telecommunication network.\nFigure 7.3.3.12.4.2.2-1: Group communication disconnect over broadcast and multicast MBS sessions.\n1.\tThe MC group communication is taking place over the associated MBS session. MCData client 1 is sending the MC data over a unicast PDU session to the MCData server.\n2.\tThe MCData server sends the MC data over the associated MBS session to MCData clients 2 to n.\n3.\tAfter the MC data transmission is over, i.e., no further data to be sent over the group communication, the MCData server sends an UnMapGroupFromSessionStream to de-associate the group communication from the MBS session.\n4.\tThe MCData server may release the MBS session as described in clause 7.3.3.3.2.\nThe MCData service shall support the procedure for using pre-established MBS session, or dynamic MBS session as specified in clause 7.3.3.1.\nMCData may use MBS session for the different types of sub-services. Both SDS and FD can use the pre-established MBS session or dynamic MBS session for distributing the data.\nApplication layer FEC can be used to recover the packet losses when delivering a MC service over 5G MBS, to reach its required level of QoS.\nThe support of FEC is optional for the MC service servers and MC service clients. FEC can be optionally applied by the MBSTF, if required by the MC service server (as specified in clause 7.3.3.13.2), or directly by the MC service server (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3]).\nIn this procedure, depicted in figure 7.3.3.13.2-1, the MC service server asks the MBSF/MBSTF to apply FEC to a set of media, transported by a 5G MBS session, using the Setup FEC request.\nThis procedure can be applied when using pre-created MBS session and session announcement (as specified in clause 7.3.3.1.2) or using MBS session and session announcement (as specified in clause 7.3.3.1.3).\nPre-condition:\n1.\tThe MC service server has already configured and activated a 5G MBS session.\nFigure 7.3.3.13.2 presents the application of Forward Error Correction (FEC) by the Multirate Broadcast System Forwarding (MBSF) and Multirate Broadcast System Transport Forwarding (MBSTF) in a telecommunication system. The figure illustrates the process of data transmission, where FEC is applied to enhance the reliability of the signal. The MBSF and MBSTF are key components in the system, responsible for managing the data flow and ensuring error-free transmission. The figure highlights the importance of FEC in maintaining the quality of service in a telecommunication network.\nFigure 7.3.3.13.2-1: Application of FEC by the MBSF-MBSTF\n1.\tThe MC service server decides to set up FEC for a set of MC service media flows. It will send the FEC request to MBSF/MBSTF.\nIt includes the following elements: the MBS session ID of the MBS session transporting those media, the media descriptions (codecs, transport protocols, bitrates, destination IP addresses and ports), the identification of the FEC repair packet flow (IP destination and port), and an upper bound to the additional latency resulting due to FEC application. The MC Service server may perform this request several times to protect separately different sets of media transported within the same 5G MBS session.\n2.\tIf the MBSF can satisfy the request, the Setup FEC response includes a modified list of media information and FEC information. The response also includes an identifier of the corresponding FEC process instance, which can be used to release the application of FEC for these media flows.\nNOTE 1:\tSource media packets may be modified by the application of FEC (e.g., addition of a footer or header), leading to a modification of the delivery protocol to be announced within the media information.\nNOTE 2:\tThe Release FEC request is not shown in the figure.\n3.\tThe MC service server announces the 5G MBS session to the MC service client with the MBS session announcement procedure, including the modified list of media information and FEC information within the SDP information.\n4.\tWhen the MC service server decides to transmit the MC service media flow for a group communication, the MC service server sends to the group a message identifying the MC service media flow and the MBS session ID, such as the MapGroupToSessionStream message for MCPTT or MCVideo.\n5.\tThe MC service server sends the downlink media to the MBSTF over Nmb8.\n6.\tThe MBSTF performs FEC encoding of the downlink media in accordance with the announced FEC algorithm and parameters and delivers it over 5G MBS.\n7.\tThe MC service client performs FEC decoding of the encoded media flows in accordance with the announced FEC information and delivers the decoded flows to the media player.\n",

The figure depicts the network infrastructure, including the core network, access network, and the relay nodes that facilitate communication between the user equipment (UE) and the network. The core network is shown at the center, with the access network extending outward, and the relay nodes positioned at critical points to ensure seamless data transmission. The figure emphasizes the importance of these components in maintaining a robust and efficient network, particularly in the face of potential disruptions or outages.\nFigure B.1-1: Service continuity from on-network to UE-to-network relay\nThe details of MBS interfaces are specified in clause 4.7. The interaction between SIP core and 5GC is specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 [2]. The procedure for service continuity from on-network MCPTT service to UE-to-network relay MCPTT service is described in Annex B of 3GPP TS 23.280 [3].\nAs illustrated in figure B.1-1:\n-\tInitially UE-1 has a direct connection to the network via 5GS (on-network MCPTT service). It is registered with the SIP core and is engaged in a SIP session with the MCPTT Application Server (solid lines SIP-1 and MC[service]-1 in figure B.1-1).\n-\tWhen UE-1 realises that it is losing connection to the network, or after the connection to the network has been lost, UE-1 discovers a UE-to-network relay (UE-R) and establishes a PC5 connection with UE-R. UE-1 registers with the SIP core over the target access leg and enters UE-to-network relay MC service by transferring the media streams over the target leg (dashed lines SIP-1 and MC[service]-1 in figure B.1-1).\n-\tThe SIP session is anchored at a Service Centralisation and Continuity Application Server (SCC AS) before and after the handover, as described in 3GPP TS 23.237 [18].\n\n",
