The receiving node can accept or indicate failure to carry out the modification request. The E1 bearer context management function also supports the release of the bearer context previously established in the gNB-CU-UP. The release of the bearer context is triggered by the gNB-CU-CP either directly or following a request received from the gNB-CU-UP.\nThis function is used to setup and modify the QoS-flow to DRB mapping configuration. The gNB-CU-CP decides flow-to-DRB mapping and provides the generated SDAP and PDCP configuration to the gNB-CU-UP. The gNB-CU-CP also decides the Reflective QoS flow to DRB mapping. The function is also used to send to the gNB-CU-UP the alternative QoS Parameters Sets when available for a QoS flow. For each PDU Session Resource to be setup or modified, the S-NSSAI, shall be provided in the E1 bearer context setup procedure and may be provided in the E1 bearer context modification procedure by gNB-CU-CP to the gNB-CU-UP.\nThis function is also used to setup and modify the EPS bearer/E-RAB to DRB mapping configuration for the case of eNB-CP and eNB-UP separation. The eNB-CP decides EPS bearer/E-RAB-to-DRB mapping and provides the E-UTRAN/NR PDCP configuration to the eNB-UP.\nThis function is also used for the gNB-CU-UP to report the MT-SDT data size to the gNB-CU-CP.\nThis function is used for the gNB-CU-CP to send the security information to the gNB-CU-UP.\nThis function is used for the gNB-CU-CP to send to the gNB-CU-UP transport layer information to be used for data forwarding e.g., during handovers.\nThis function is used for the gNB-CU-CP to send the parameters for header compression for certain traffic types e.g., IP, Ethernet to the gNB-CU-UP.\nThis function is used for the gNB-CU-CP to send the uplink data compression parameters to the gNB-CU-UP for certain data radio bearer(s).\nThis function is used for the gNB-CU-UP to notify the event of DL data arrival detection to the gNB-CU-CP. With this function, the gNB-CU-UP requests gNB-CU-CP to trigger paging procedure over F1 or Xn to support RRC Inactive state. RRC Inactive state is not supported when this function is used between an eNB-CP and an eNB-UP.\nThis function is used for the gNB-CU-UP to notify the gNB-CU-CP that a DL packet including a QFI value not configured by the gNB-CU-CP or an UL packet including a QFI value in the SDAP header of the default DRB not configured by the gNB-CU-CP is received for the first time. The gNB-CU-CP can take further action if needed.\nThis function is used for the gNB-CU-UP to notify the gNB-CU-CP during the SDT procedure that the received DL SDT data crossed the data size threshold. The gNB-CU-CP can take further action if needed.\nThis function is used for the gNB-CU-UP to notify the event of user inactivity to the gNB-CU-CP. With this function, the gNB-CU-UP indicates that the inactivity timer associated with a bearer, a PDU session or a UE expires, or that user data is received for the bearer, the PDU session or the UE whose inactivity timer has expired. The gNB-CU-CP consolidates all the serving gNB-CU-UPs for the UE and takes further action.\nThis function is used for the gNB-CU-UP to report data volume to the gNB-CU-CP.\nThis function is used for the gNB-CU-CP to notify the suspension and resumption of bearer contexts to the gNB-CU-UP. Suspension and resumption of bearer contexts are not applicable to eNB-CP/eNB-UP and ng-eNB-CU-CP/ng-eNB-CU-UP.\nThis function also allows to support CA based packet duplication as described in TS 38.300 [6], i.e. one data radio bearer should be configured with at least two GTP-U tunnels between gNB-CU-UP and a gNB-DU.\nThis function is used to support the enhanced mobility operations as described in TS 38.300 [6] in the gNB-CU-UP.\n",

The application layer signalling protocol is referred to as E1AP (E1 Application Protocol).\nFigure 7.1-1 illustrates the interface protocol structure for E1, showcasing the various layers involved in the communication process. The figure displays the physical layer, which includes the electrical signals transmitted over the E1 interface. Above the physical layer, we can observe the data link layer, responsible for error detection and correction. The higher layers, such as the network layer and the transport layer, are also depicted, providing a comprehensive overview of the interface protocol structure for E1. This structure is crucial for understanding the communication process and ensuring efficient data transmission.\nFigure 7.1-1: Interface protocol structure for E1\n",
