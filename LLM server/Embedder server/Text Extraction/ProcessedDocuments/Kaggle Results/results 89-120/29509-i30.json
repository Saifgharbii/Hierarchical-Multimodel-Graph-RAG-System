The content of the resource will depend on the procedure and will be returned to the AMF.\nThis service operation \"Authenticate\" also permits the requester NF to initiate the Authentication of the FN-RG registration via W-AGF by providing the following information to the AUSF:\n-\tUE id (i.e. SUCI)\n-\tIndication that the W-AGF has authenticated the FN-RG\nThe AUSF retrieves the UE's SUPI, indication that authentication is not required for the FN-RG from the UDM, and AUSF shall not perform the authentication.\nThe service operation \"Authenticate\" also permits the requester NF to inform the AUSF to remove the UE authentication result in the UDM.\nIn this procedure, the NF Service Consumer (AMF) requests the authentication of the UE by providing UE related information and the Serving Network Name to the NF Service Producer (AUSF), which retrieves UE related data and authentication method from the UDM. In this case the retrieved authentication method is 5G AKA. The NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall then return to the AUSF the result received from the UE:\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2.2.2.2-1 illustrates the architecture of a 5G network, specifically focusing on the Access and Aggregation (AKA) layer. The figure showcases the interconnection of various network elements, including the gNodeB (gNB), eNB, and the AKA node. The AKA node serves as a crucial component in the network, facilitating the aggregation of user traffic and enabling efficient resource allocation. The figure also highlights the role of the eNB in providing local access to the network and the gNB in managing the overall network resources. The visual representation emphasizes the importance of these components in ensuring a seamless and efficient 5G network experience.\nFigure 5.2.2.2.2-1: 5G AKA\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall send a POST request to the AUSF. The content shall contain at least the UE Id and the Serving Network Name.\n2a.\tOn success, \"201 Created\" shall be returned. The content shall contain the representation of the resource created and the \"Location\" header shall contain the URI of the created resource (e.g. .../ue_authentications/{authCtxId}). The AUSF generates a sub-resource \"5g-aka-confirmation\". There shall be only one sub-resource \"5g-aka-confirmation\" per UE per Serving Network identified by the supiOrSuci and servingNetworkName in AuthenticationInfo. The AUSF shall provide an hypermedia link towards this sub-resource in the content to indicate to the AMF where it shall send a PUT for the confirmation.\n2b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table 6.1.3.2.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.2.3.1-3. If the serving network is not authorized, the AUSF shall use the SERVING_NETWORK_NOT_AUTHORIZED \"cause\".\n3.\tBased on the relation type, the NF Service Consumer (AMF) deduces that it shall send a PUT containing the \"RES*\" provided by the UE to the URI provided by the AUSF or derived by itself. The NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall also send a PUT containing null value in the RES* to indicate the failure to the AUSF for the following cases:\n-\tif the UE is not reached, and the RES* is never received by the NF Service Consumer (AMF);\n-\tthe comparation of the HRES* and HXRES* is unsuccessful in the NF Service Consumer (AMF);\n-\tthe authentication failure is received from the UE, e.g. synchronization failure or MAC failure;\n4a.\tOn success, \"200 OK\" shall be returned. If the UE is not authenticated, e.g. the verification of the RES* was not successful in the AUSF, the AUSF shall set the value of AuthResult to AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE.\nIn SNPN onboarding scenarios, if the UE is authenticated successfully, the AUSF may include in the response the FQDN(s) and/or IP address(es) of an onboarding Provisioning Server (PVS) to the NF Service Consumer (AMF); see 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], clause 5.30.2.10.\n4b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table 6.1.3.3.3.1-3 shall be returned.

EAP messages are exchanged between a UE acting as EAP peer, an NF Service Consumer (AMF/SEAF, NSWOF) acting as a pass-through authenticator and the AUSF acting as the EAP server.\n5.2.2.2.3.2\tEAP method: EAP-AKA'\nEAP-AKA' is the EAP method used in this procedure\n\nFigure 5.2.2.2.3-1 illustrates the EAP-based authentication process with the EAP-AKA method, showcasing the various stages of authentication including the initial connection, EAP-AKA handshake, and successful authentication. Key components include the client, server, and EAP-AKA parameters, which work together to ensure secure and efficient communication. The figure highlights the importance of strong authentication methods in maintaining network security.\nFigure 5.2.2.2.3-1: EAP-based authentication with EAP-AKA' method\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer (AMF, NSWOF) shall send a POST request to the AUSF. The content shall contain at least the UE Id, Serving Network Name. If the consumer is an NSWOF the NSWO Indicator shall be present in the content.\n2a.\tOn success, \"201 Created\" shall be returned. The content shall contain the representation of the resource generated and the \"Location\" header shall contain the URI of the generated resource (e.g. .../ue_authentications/{authCtxId}). The AUSF generates a sub-resource \"eap-session\". There shall be only one sub-resource \"eap-session\" per UE per Serving Network identified by the supiOrSuci and servingNetworkName in AuthenticationInfo. The AUSF shall provide a hypermedia link towards this sub-resource in the payload to indicate to the AMF or NSWOF where it shall send a POST containing the EAP packet response. The content shall also contain the EAP packet EAP-Request/AKA'-Challenge.\n2b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table 6.1.3.2.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.2.3.1-3. In particular, if the serving network is not authorized, the AUSF shall use the \"Cause\" SERVING_NETWORK_NOT_AUTHORIZED.\n3.\tBased on the relation type, the NF Service Consumer (AMF, NSOWF) shall send a POST request including the EAP-Response/AKA' Challenge received from the UE. The POST request is sent to the URI provided by the AUSF or derived by the NF Service Consumer (AMF, NSWOF).\n4a.\tOn success, and if the AUSF and the UE have indicated the use of protected successful result indications as in IETF RFC 9048 [17], the AUSF shall reply with a \"200 OK\" HTTP message containing the EAP Request/AKA' Notification and an hypermedia link towards the sub-resource \"eap-session\".\n4b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table 6.1.3.4.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.4.3.1-3.\nNOTE: Steps 4 to 5 are optional.\n5.\tThe NF Service Consumer (AMF, NSWOF) shall send a POST request including the EAP Response/AKA' Notification received from the UE. The POST request is sent to the URI provided by the AUSF or derived by the NF Service Consumer (AMF, NSWOF).\n6a.\tIf the EAP authentication exchange is successfully completed (with or without the optional Notification Request/Response messages exchange), \"200 OK\" shall be returned to the NF Service Consumer (AMF, NSWOF). The content shall contain the result of the authentication, an EAP success/failure and if the authentication is successful the Kseaf if the consumer is an AMF or the MSK if the consumer is a NSWOF (as indicated by the NSWO indicator received in step 1). If the UE is not authenticated, the AUSF shall set the authResult to AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE.\nIn SNPN onboarding scenarios, if the UE is authenticated successfully, the AUSF may include in the response the FQDN(s) and/or IP address(es) of an onboarding Provisioning Server (PVS) to the NF Service Consumer (AMF) ; see 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], clause 5.30.2.10.\n6b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table 6.1.3.4.3.1-3 shall be returned.

The corresponding stage 3 implementation is described in Annex B.\nThe EAP-TLS method is applicable for N5GC devices behind Cable RGs in private networks or in deployment scenarios with wireline access; see 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] Annex O.\n5.2.2.2.3.4\tEAP method: EAP-TTLS\nThe EAP-TTLS method can be used as an EAP method (see 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] Annex U) in case of UE access to SNPN using credentials from Credential Holder with AAA Server.\nIn this procedure, the NF Service Consumer (AMF) requests the authentication of the FN-RG registration via W-AGF by providing the SUCI of the FN-RG and the authenticated indication.\n\n\nFigure 5.2.2.2.4-1 illustrates the authentication process for a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) Resource Group (RG) in a network. The figure shows the flow of authentication requests, starting from the client device, passing through the Network Function (NF) Gateway, and finally reaching the Resource Group. Key components include the Network Authentication Server (NAS), Network Policy Server (NPS), and the FQDN RG. The figure highlights the use of Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for authentication, ensuring secure access to network resources.\nFigure 5.2.2.2.4-1: Authentication for FN-RG\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall send a POST request to the AUSF. The content shall contain at least the UE Id and the authenticated indication.\n2a.\tOn success, \"201 Created\" shall be returned.

For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.4.3.1-3.\nIn the case that the Purge of subscriber data in AMF after the UE deregisters from the network or the NAS SMC fails following the successful authentication in the registration procedure, the NF Service Consumer (AMF) requests the AUSF to inform the UDM to remove the authentication result:\n\nFigure 5.2.2.2.5-1 illustrates the process of removing authentication results using the 5G Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) method. The figure depicts the flow of data packets through the network, highlighting the removal of authentication results at the eMBMS (Evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service) stage. The figure emphasizes the importance of this step in ensuring secure and efficient data transmission in 5G networks.\nFigure 5.2.2.2.5-1: Authentication Result Removal with 5G AKA method\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall send a DELETE request to the resource URI representing the sub-resource \"5g-aka-confirmation\".

For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.3.3.2-3..\nIn the case that the Purge of subscriber data in AMF after the UE deregisters from the network or the NAS SMC fails following the successful authentication the registration procedure, the NF Service Consumer (AMF) requests the AUSF to inform the UDM to remove the authentication result:\n\nFigure 5.2.2.2.6-1 illustrates the process of removing authentication results using the EAP-AKA' method. The figure depicts the flow of packets through a network, starting with the client device sending an EAP-AKA' packet to the authentication server. The server responds with an EAP-AKA' response, which includes the authentication result. The client then removes the authentication result from the response and sends it back to the server. The server acknowledges the removal and sends a successful authentication result back to the client. The figure highlights the importance of this process in ensuring secure and efficient communication in a network.\nFigure 5.2.2.2.6-1: Authentication Result Removal with EAP-AKA' method\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall send a DELETE request to the resource URI representing the sub-resource \"eap-session\".

For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.4.3.2-3.\n\nThe Deregister service operation is used in the following scenario:\n-\tDeletion of security context in AUSF\nThe NF Service Consumer (e.g. UDM) uses this service operation to request the AUSF to clear the stale security context, after the UE has been successfully (re)authenticated in same or different Serving Network via another AUSF Instance, e.g. due to registration via another access-type; so as to ensure only latest Kausf is maintained in the network. The service may also be used by UDM when the UE is no longer registered via any access-type or serving-network. It is responsibility of NF Service Consumers to ensure that security context being deleted does not hold the latest Kausf if UE is also connected via another Serving-Network.\n\n\nFigure 5.2.2.3.1-1: UE Context Clean-up in AUSF illustrates the process of cleaning up user equipment (UE) contexts in the Authentication and Authorization Service Function (AUSF). The figure shows the interaction between the AUSF and the UE, highlighting the steps involved in context clean-up, including the release of temporary identifiers and the removal of associated data. This process is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of the network by ensuring that outdated or unnecessary UE contexts are removed, preventing potential security breaches and resource wastage.\nFigure 5.2.2.3.1-1: UE Context Clean-up in AUSF\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer (e.g. UDM) shall send a POST request to the AUSF that was used to authenticate the UE. The content shall contain the UE id (e.g. SUPI).\n2a.\tOn success, \"204 No Content\" shall be returned.\n2b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table 6.1.3.2.4.2.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.2.4.2.2-2.\n\nThe ProseAuthenticate service operation is used in the following scenario:\n-\tAuthenticate the 5G ProSe Remote UE in AUSF or 5G ProSe End UE\nThe NF Service Consumer (AMF) requests the authentication of the 5G ProSe Remote UE or the 5G ProSe End UE  by providing 5G ProSe Remote UE or the 5G ProSe End UE  related information (SUCI or CP-PRUK ID), the Relay Service Code and Nonce_1 to the NF Service Producer (AUSF) in the initial authentication request. When CP-PRUK ID is provided, the AUSF shall retrieve the CP-PRUK from PAnF; when SUCI is provided, the AUSF retrieves 5G ProSe Remote UE or the 5G ProSe End UE  related data and authentication method from the UDM. In this case the retrieved authentication method is EAP-AKA. The NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall then return to the AUSF the result received from the 5G ProSe Remote UE or the 5G ProSe End UE  to continue the authentication:\n\n\nFigure 5.2.2.4.1-1: ProSe Authentication illustrates the process of ProSe authentication in a telecommunication network. The figure depicts the interaction between the ProSe-enabled device and the network server, highlighting the exchange of authentication messages and the establishment of a secure connection. Key components include the ProSe device, network server, and authentication protocol. The diagram emphasizes the importance of secure communication in maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of data transmitted over the network.\nFigure 5.2.2.4.1-1: ProSe Authentication\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall send a POST request to the AUSF. The content shall contain the UE Id (SUCI) or CP-PRUK ID, Relay Service Code and Nonce_1.\n2a.\tOn success, \"201 Created\" shall be returned if UE Id (SUCI) is received. The content shall contain the representation of the resource generated and the \"Location\" header shall contain the URI of the generated resource (e.g. .../prose_authentications/{authCtxId}). The AUSF generates a sub-resource \"prose-auth\". There shall be only one sub-resource \"prose-auth\" per UE identified by the supiOrSuci in ProSeAuthenticationInfo. The AUSF shall provide a hypermedia link towards this sub-resource in the content to indicate to the AMF where it shall send a POST containing the EAP packet response. The content shall also contain the EAP packet EAP-Request/AKA'-Challenge.\n2b. On success, \"200 OK\" shall be returned if CP-PRUK ID is received. The payload body shall contain the KNR_ProSe and Nonce_2. Step 3 to 6 are skipped.\n2c.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table 6.1.3.2.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.2.3.1-3.\n3.\tBased on the relation type, the NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall send a POST request including the EAP-Response/AKA' Challenge received from the 5G ProSe Remote UE or the 5G ProSe End UE. The POST request is sent to the URI provided by the AUSF or derived by the NF Service Consumer (AMF).\n4a.\tOn success, and if the AUSF and the UE have indicated the use of protected successful result indications as in IETF RFC 5448 [9] (to be superseded by draft-ietf-emu-rfc5448bis [17]), the AUSF shall reply with a \"200 OK\" HTTP message containing the EAP Request/AKA' Notification and an hypermedia link towards the sub-resource \"prose-auth\".\n4b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table 6.1.3.4.3.1-3 shall be returned.

The POST request is sent to the URI provided by the AUSF or derived by the NF Service Consumer (AMF).\n6a.\tIf the ProSe authentication exchange is successfully completed (with or without the optional Notification Request/Response messages exchange), \"200 OK\" shall be returned to the NF Service Consumer (AMF). The content shall contain the result of the authentication, an EAP success/failure. The content shall also contain the KNR_ProSe, Nonce_2 and CP-PRUK ID if the authentication is successful. If the 5G ProSe Remote UE or the 5G ProSe End UE  is not authenticated, the AUSF shall set the authResult to AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE.\n6b.\tOn failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table 6.1.3.4.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.4.3.1-3.\nIn the case that the authentication of a 5G ProSe Remote UE or the 5G ProSe End UEfails, the NF Service Consumer (AMF) requests the AUSF to inform the UDM to remove the authentication result:\n\nFigure 5.2.2.4.2-1 illustrates the process of removing the result of ProSe authentication using the EAP-AKA' method. The figure depicts the interaction between the ProSe-enabled device and the network server, highlighting the authentication process and the removal of the authentication result. Key components include the ProSe device, network server, and EAP-AKA' method, which ensures secure and efficient communication between the two.

The figure shows the hierarchical organization of URIs, starting from the top-level domain and extending to specific resources. This structure is essential for efficient communication and management of resources within the API. The figure highlights the use of namespaces, which allow for the organization of URIs into logical groups, enabling developers to manage and access resources more effectively. Additionally, the figure demonstrates the use of relative URIs, which simplify navigation within the API and improve performance.

This procedure is described in Annex B.2.1 of 3GPP TS 33.501 [8].\nFigure B.2-1 illustrates the Enhanced Authentication Protocol (EAP) method used in wireless communication systems. The figure depicts the various stages of the EAP process, including the initiation of the authentication process, the exchange of authentication messages between the client and the authentication server, and the successful completion of the authentication process. The figure highlights the importance of secure authentication in wireless networks, as it ensures the integrity and confidentiality of data transmitted over the network. The EAP method is a crucial component of modern wireless communication systems, as it helps to prevent unauthorized access and protect against cyber threats.\nFigure B.2-1: EAP method\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall send a POST request to the AUSF.

The AUSF generates a sub-resource \"eap-session\". The AUSF shall provide a hypermedia link towards this sub-resource in the content to indicate to the AMF where it shall send a POST containing the EAP packet response.
