Radiated requirements are also referred to as OTA requirements. The (spatial) characteristics in which the OTA requirements apply are detailed for each requirement. For IAB type 1-H the requirements are defined for two points of reference, signified by radiated requirements at the RIB and the conducted requirements at transceiver array boundary (TAB). The OTA requirements of IAB type 1-H are tested in the far field (Fraunhofer) region.\nGeneral architecture and reference points of IAB type 1-H, IAB type 1-O and IAB type 2-O are presented on the following figures 4.2-1 and 4.2-2.\nFigure 4.2-1 illustrates the general architecture of an Integrated Access Backbone (IAB) type 1-H, which is a telecommunication system used for transmitting and receiving data. The figure shows the various components involved in the system, including the Optical Line Terminal (OLT), Optical Network Unit (ONU), and Optical Network Terminal (ONT). The OLT is responsible for transmitting optical signals to the ONU, which then converts the signals into electrical signals for distribution to the ONTs. The ONT is responsible for converting the electrical signals back into optical signals for transmission to the user's device. The figure also shows the various types of connections between the components, including point-to-point and point-to-multipoint connections. The architecture is designed to provide high-speed, reliable data transmission and is commonly used in telecommunications networks.\nFigure 4.2-1: General architecture of IAB type 1-H\nThe present document details only radiated test requirements and hence only requires the radiated reference points.\nFigure 4.2-2 illustrates the general architecture of an Integrated Access Backbone (IAB) type 1-O and IAB type 2-O. The figure showcases the various components involved in the network, including the Optical Line Terminal (OLT), Optical Network Unit (ONU), and Optical Network Terminal (ONT). The IAB type 1-O and IAB type 2-O are designed to provide efficient and reliable access to optical networks, with the IAB type 1-O focusing on point-to-point connections and the IAB type 2-O catering to multipoint connections. The figure highlights the importance of these components in delivering high-speed, high-capacity, and high-quality optical network services.\nFigure 4.2-2: General architecture of IAB type 1-O and IAB type 2-O\nThe transceiver unit array is part of the composite transceiver functionality generating modulated transmit signal structures and performing receiver combining and demodulation.\nThe transceiver unit array contains an implementation specific number of transmitter units and an implementation specific number of receiver units. Transmitter units and receiver units may be combined into transceiver units. The transmitter/receiver units have the ability to receive/send parallel independent modulated symbol streams.\nThe composite antenna contains a radio distribution network (RDN) and an antenna array. The RDN is a linear passive network that distributes the RF power between the transceiver array boundary and the antenna array, in an implementation specific way.\n",

Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.\nThe OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for the IAB-MT type 1-O.

Radiated performance requirements are specified at the RIB.\nRadiated performance requirements for the BS are specified for the fixed reference channels and propagation conditions defined in TS 38.174 [2] annex A and annex G, respectively. The requirements only apply to those FRCs that are supported by the IAB-DU.\nThe radiated performance requirements for IAB type 1-O and for the IAB type 2-O are limited to two OTA demodulations branches as described in clause 8.1.1.2. Conformance requirements can only be tested for 1 or 2 demodulation branches depending on the number of polarizations supported by the IAB-DU, with the required SNR applied separately per polarization.\nNOTE: \tIAB-DU can support more than 2 demodulation branches, however OTA conformance testing can only be performed for 1 or 2 demodulation branches.\nUnless stated otherwise, radiated performance requirements apply for a single carrier only. Radiated performance requirements for a IAB-DU supporting CA are defined in terms of single carrier requirements.\nThe method of synchronization with the TE is left to implementation. Neither the use of downlink signal configuration nor the use of proprietary means is precluded. In tests performed with signal generators a synchronization signal may be provided between the IAB-DU and the signal generator, or a common (e.g., GNSS) source may be provided to both IAB node and the signal generator, to enable correct timing of the wanted signal.\nThe SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and defined as:\nSNR = S / N\nWhere:\nS\tis the total signal energy in a slot on a RIB.\nN\tis the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission bandwidth over the duration of a slot.\nRadiated performance requirements are only specified for up to 2 demodulation branches.\nIf the IAB type 1-O, or the IAB type 2-O uses polarization diversity and has the ability to maintain isolation between the signals for each of the demodulation branches, then radiated performance requirements can be tested for up to two demodulation branches (i.e. 1RX or 2RX test setups). When tested for two demodulation branches, each demodulation branch maps to one polarization.\nIf the IAB type 1-O, or the IAB type 2-O does not use polarization diversity then radiated performance requirements can only be tested for a single demodulation branch (i.e. 1RX test setup).\nUnless otherwise stated, for a IAB-DU declared to support more than 2 demodulation branches (for IAB type 1-O and IAB type 2-O), the performance requirement tests for 2 demodulation branches shall apply, and the mapping between connectors and demodulation branches is up to BS implementation.\nThe tests requiring more than [20] dB SNR level are set to N/A in the test requirements.\n8.1.1.3.2.1\tApplicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings\nUnless otherwise stated, PUSCH requirement tests shall apply only for each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported (see D.7 in table 4.6-1).\nUnless otherwise stated, if IAB-DU supports more than one SCS then PUSCH requirement tests with highest modulation order (see D.109 in table 4.6-1) shall apply only with lowest supported SCS and PUSCH requirement tests with other modulation orders (see D.109 in table 4.6-1) shall apply only with highest supported SCS. Otherwise, all modulation orders are tested on supported SCS.\n8.1.1.3.2.2\tApplicability of requirements for different channel bandwidths\nFor each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported, the test requirements for a specific channel bandwidth shall apply only if the IAB-DU supports it (see D.7 in table 4.6-1).\nUnless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported, the tests shall be done only for the widest supported channel bandwidth. If performance requirement is not specified for this widest supported channel bandwidth, the tests shall be done by using performance requirement for the closest channel bandwidth lower than this widest supported bandwidth; the tested PRBs shall then be centered in this widest supported channel bandwidth.\n8.1.1.3.2.3\tApplicability of requirements for different configurations\nUnless otherwise stated, for IAB type 1-O, PUSCH requirement tests shall apply only for the mapping type declared to be supported (see D.100 in table 4.6-1). If both mapping type A and type B are declared to be supported, the tests shall be done for either type A or type B; the same chosen mapping type shall then be used for all tests.\nUnless otherwise stated, for IAB type 2-O, PUSCH requirement tests shall apply only for the additional DM-RS position declared to be supported (see D.101 in table 4.6-1). If both options (i.e., pos0 and pos1) are declared to be supported, the tests shall be done for pos1.\nUnless otherwise stated, for IAB type 2-O, PUSCH requirement tests with transform precoding disabled shall apply for the PT-RS option declared to be supported (see D.106 in table 4.6-1). If both PT-RS options (without and with PT-RS) are declared to be supported, the tests shall be done for either without or with PT-RS only; the same chosen option shall then be used for all tests.\nUnless otherwise stated, for IAB type 2-O, PUSCH requirement tests with transform precoding enabled shall be done for without PT-RS.\n8.1.1.3.2.4\tApplicability of requirements for uplink carrier aggregation\nThe tests for uplink carrier aggregation shall be carried out according to the declaration (see D.108 in table 4.6-1).\nUnless otherwise stated, the tests for uplink carrier aggregation shall apply only for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled, and shall be conducted on per component carrier basis.\n8.1.1.3.2.5\tApplicability of requirements for TDD with different UL-DL patterns\nUnless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported, if IAB-DU supports multiple TDD UL-DL patterns, only one of the supported TDD UL-DL patterns shall be used for all tests.\n8.1.1.3.2.6\tApplicability of requirements for transform precoding\nUnless otherwise stated, the tests with transform precoding enabled shall apply only, if the IAB-DU supports it (see D.110 in table 4.6-1).\n8.1.1.3.3.1\tApplicability of requirements for different formats\nUnless otherwise stated, PUCCH requirement tests shall apply only for each PUCCH format declared to be supported (see D.102 in table 4.6-1).\n8.1.1.3.3.2\tApplicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings\nUnless otherwise stated, PUCCH requirement tests shall apply only for each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported (see D.7 in table 4.6-1).

If performance requirement is not specified for this widest supported channel bandwidth, the tests shall be done by using performance requirement for the closest channel bandwidth lower than this widest supported bandwidth; the tested PRBs shall then be centered in this widest supported channel bandwidth.\n8.1.1.3.3.4\tApplicability of requirements for different configurations\nUnless otherwise stated, PUCCH format 3 requirement tests shall apply only for the additional DM-RS configuration declared to be supported (see D.104 in table 4.6-1). If both options (without and with additional DM-RS) are declared to be supported, the tests shall be done for either without or with additional DM-RS; the same chosen option shall then be used for all tests.\nUnless otherwise stated, PUCCH format 4 requirement tests shall apply only for the additional DM-RS configuration declared to be supported (see D.105 in table 4.6-1). If both options (without and with additional DM-RS) are declared to be supported, the tests shall be done for either without or with additional DM-RS; the same chosen option shall then be used for all tests.\n8.1.1.3.3.5\tApplicability of requirements for multi-slot PUCCH\nUnless otherwise stated, multi-slot PUCCH requirement tests shall apply only if the IAB-DU supports it (see D.107 in table 4.6-1).\n8.1.1.3.4.1\tApplicability of requirements for different formats\nUnless otherwise stated, PRACH requirement tests shall apply only for PRACH formats declared to be supported (see D.103 in table 4.6-1).\nFor IAB-DU declares to support more than one PRACH formats, limit the number of tests to any two cases chosen by the manufacturer. If IAB-DU declares to support more than one PRACH formats where formats for both long and short PRACH sequences are presented, require choosing formats with different sequences (see D.103 in table 4.6-1).\n8.1.1.3.4.2\tApplicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings\nUnless otherwise stated, for each PRACH format with short sequence declared to be supported, for each FR, the tests shall apply only for the smallest supported subcarrier spacing in the FR (see D.103 in table 4.6-1).\n8.1.1.3.4.3\tApplicability of requirements for different channel bandwidths\nUnless otherwise stated, for the subcarrier spacing to be tested, the test requirements shall apply only for anyone channel bandwidth declared to be supported (see D.7 in table 4.6-1).\n",

                            "text_content": "The performance requirement of PRACH for preamble detection is determined by the two parameters: total probability of false detection of the preamble (Pfa) and the probability of detection of preamble (Pd). The performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of detection, Pd of 99%. Pfa shall be 0.1% or less.\nPfa is defined as a conditional total probability of erroneous detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when input is only noise.\nPd is defined as conditional probability of detection of the preamble when the signal is present. The erroneous detection consists of several error cases – detecting only different preamble(s) than the one that was sent, not detecting any preamble at all, or detecting the correct preamble but with the out-of-bounds timing estimation value. For AWGN, TDLC300-100 and TDLA30-300, a timing estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than the time error tolerance values given in table 8.1.4.1.1-1.\nTable 8.1.4.1.1-1: Time error tolerance for AWGN, TDLC300-100 and TDLA30-300\n\nThe test preambles for normal mode are listed in table A.2.5-1 and A.2.5-2.\nWhich specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.3.4.\nFor IAB type 1-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 [2] clause 11.1.4.1.1 and 11.1.4.1.2.\nFor IAB type 2-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 [2] clause 11.1.4.2.1 and 11.1.4.2.2.\nThe test shall verify the receiver's ability to detect PRACH preamble under static conditions and multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.\n8.1.4.1.4.1\tInitial conditions\nTest environment:\tNormal, see clause B.2.\nRF channels to be tested:\tfor single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.\nDirection to be tested:\tOTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).\n8.1.4.1.4.2\tProcedure\n1)\tPlace the IAB DU with its manufacturer declared coordinate system reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test system, as shown in annex E.3.\n2)\tAlign the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the IAB DU with the test system.\n3)\tSet the IAB DU in the declared direction to be tested.\n4)\tConnect the IAB DU tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3.

This pattern is repeated as illustrated in figure 8.1.4.1.4.2-1. The preambles are sent with certain timing offsets as described below. The following statistics are kept: the number of preambles detected in the idle period and the number of missed preambles.\nFigure 8.1.4.1.4.2-1 presents a PRACH preamble test pattern, which is a crucial component in the 5G New Radio (NR) protocol. The figure illustrates the structure of the preamble, consisting of a cyclic prefix, a random access code (RAC), and a cyclic Reduced Instruction Set Computer (CR-I) code. The preamble is designed to ensure synchronization and reliable transmission between the base station and the user equipment (UE). The figure highlights the importance of the PRACH preamble in enabling efficient and accurate timing synchronization, which is vital for the performance of 5G NR systems.\nFigure 8.1.4.1.4.2-1: PRACH preamble test pattern\nThe timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format 0 is set to 50% of Ncs. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested range, which is 0.9us. Then the loop is being reset and the timing offset is set again to 50% of Ncs. The timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0 is presented in Figure 8.1.4.1.4.2-2.\nFigure 8.1.4.1.4.2-2 illustrates a timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0, which is crucial for efficient synchronization in a wireless communication system. The figure depicts the preamble structure, including the cyclic prefix and the timing offset, which helps in aligning the received signal with the transmitted signal. The timing offset is represented by the offset bits, which are used to adjust the timing of the preamble for optimal synchronization. The figure also shows the relationship between the preamble structure and the synchronization performance, highlighting the importance of accurate timing for reliable communication.\nFigure 8.1.4.1.4.2-2: Timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0\nThe timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format A1, A2, A3, B4, C0 and C2 is set to 0. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested range, which is 0.8us. Then the loop is being reset and the timing offset is set again to 0. The timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format A1, A2, A3, B4, C0 and C2 is presented in Figure 8.1.4.1.4.2-3.\nFigure 8.1.4.1.4.2-3 illustrates a timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format A1, A2, A3, B4, C0, and C2 in a telecommunication system. The figure depicts the synchronization of PRACH preambles with the help of a cyclic prefix and a cyclic Reduced Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) channel. The preambles are divided into different groups, each with its unique timing offset, to ensure efficient synchronization and reduce inter-symbol interference. The figure also shows the relationship between the preamble format and the timing offset, highlighting the importance of precise timing in maintaining signal integrity and quality in the telecommunication system.\nFigure 8.1.4.1.4.2-3: Timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format A1, A2, A3, B4, C0 and C2\n8.1.4.1.5.1\tTest requirement for IAB type 1-O\nPfa shall not exceed 0.1%.

This is connected to an environment control system which regulates the temperature inside the enclosure. The remaining equipment inside the OTA chamber (any suitable antenna test range chamber type is acceptable) is outside the environmental control and is at nominal temperature. Positioners, test antennas and all other OTA test equipment do not need to be specified over the extreme temperature range.\nFigure B.7.1-1 illustrates the measurement setup for extreme conditions, utilizing the direct far-field method to ensure high accuracy in determining the Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP). The setup consists of a transmitter, receiver, and various antennas positioned at different distances from the transmitter. The transmitter emits signals, which are received by the receiver and analyzed for EIRP. The antennas are strategically placed to capture signals from various angles, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of the EIRP under different conditions. The figure emphasizes the importance of precise measurements in evaluating the performance of telecommunication systems under extreme conditions.\nFigure B.7.1-1: Measurement set up for extreme conditions for EIRP accuracy using direct far field method\nThe presence of the environmental chamber inside the OTA chamber may affect the measurement accuracy due to additional reflections and refractions, also the loss through the environmental enclosure may not be consistent with direction as the path through the radome may vary with angle. Hence the system should be calibrated in all tested directions, frequencies and temperatures if necessary.\nNOTE:\tCurrently only a single direction is specified for extreme testing so a single calibration direction is sufficient.\nConformance may be demonstrated by measuring the difference between the nominal measurement and the extreme measurement (Δsample) or by measuring Pmax,c,EIRP, extreme directly.\nMeasure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2) and calculate total radiated transmit power for particular beam direction pair as EIRP = EIRPp1 + EIRPp2.\n",

The RF conditions inside the chamber are absorptive and capable of dissipating the power of the IAB when radiating. A sample antenna or RF probe are placed in a location which gives a sample of the main beam EIRP but does not have to accurately measure the EIRP directly, instead the near-field response is measured. For this method test components are exposed to the full temperature range for example the test antenna/probe, cables, absorbers etc. may change as a function of temperature.\nUsing the relative method it is also necessary to measure the EIRP under nominal conditions using an appropriately calibrated far field (or near filed) test range to obtain Pmax,c,EIRP.\nFigure B.7.2-1 illustrates the measurement setup for extreme conditions to assess the accuracy of EIRP (Effective Isotropic Radiated Power) using the difference method. The setup involves a transmitter, receiver, and various test antennas positioned at different distances from the transmitter. The goal is to measure the power levels at the receiver, comparing them to the expected values based on the transmitter's specifications. This method is crucial for ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and maintaining the integrity of the communication system under challenging conditions.\nFigure B.7.2-1: Measurement set up for extreme conditions for EIRP accuracy using difference method\nMeasurements from the test antenna/probe are taken under nominal conditions and extreme conditions to calculate (Δsample). The difference between the nominal and extreme conditions (Δsample) is then used along with the nominal EIRP measurement (Pmax,c,EIRP) made in the appropriate far field or near field chamber and compared against the extreme requirement. As follows:\nPmax,c,EIRP, extreme = Pmax,c,EIRP + Δsample.\nMeasure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2) and calculate total radiated transmit power for particular beam direction pair as EIRP = EIRPp1 + EIRPp2.\n\nThe test requirements explicitly defined in the present document have been calculated by relaxing the minimum requirements of the core specification TS 38.174 [2] using the test tolerances (TT) defined here. When the TT value is zero, the test requirement will be the same as the minimum requirement. When the TT value is non-zero, the test requirements will differ from the minimum requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation is given in the following tables.\nThe TTOTA values are derived from OTA Test System uncertainties, regulatory requirements and criticality to system performance. As a result, the TTOTA values may sometimes be set to zero.\nThe TTOTA values should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take account of commonly known OTA Test System errors (such as mismatch, cable loss, etc.).\nNote that a formula for applying TTOTA values is provided for all OTA tests, even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in the case where the OTA Test System uncertainty is greater than that allowed in clause 4.1.2. In this event, the excess error shall be subtracted from the defined TTOTA value in order to generate the correct tightened test requirements as defined in this annex.\n",

For the situation where the noise level is stable, the noise level change can be identified by a relative noise measurement method. This method measures the relative noise change extracted from when the test object is operating and when the power is disconnected.
