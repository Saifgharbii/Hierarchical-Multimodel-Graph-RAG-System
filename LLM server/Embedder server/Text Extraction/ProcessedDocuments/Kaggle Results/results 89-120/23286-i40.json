It utilizes the architectural reference model specified in clause 4.2 in 3GPP TS 23.285 [5] and clause 4.2 in 3GPP TS 23.287 [19] which have impact on the application layer support aspects.\nFigure 6.2-1 presents a simplified architectural model for the V2X application layer, illustrating the integration of various communication technologies and protocols. The figure showcases the interaction between vehicles, roadside units, and cloud-based services, emphasizing the role of 5G and C-V2X in enabling seamless communication and data exchange. Key components include the vehicle gateway, roadside units, and cloud infrastructure, which work together to facilitate real-time communication, traffic management, and safety applications. The figure highlights the need for efficient resource allocation and network slicing to support the diverse requirements of connected vehicles and smart transportation systems.\nFigure 6.2-1: Simplified architectural model for the V2X application layer\nThe V2X UE1 communicates with V2X application server over V1 reference point. The V2X UE1 and V2X UE2 communicate over V5 reference point. V2X UE1 can also act as a UE-to-network relay, to enable V2X UE2 to access the V2X application server over V1 reference point.\nThe reference point V1 supports the V2X application related interactions between V2X UE and V2X AS and is specified in 3GPP TS 23.285 [5] and 3GPP TS 23.287 [19]. This reference point is supported for both unicast and multicast delivery modes. The reference point V5 supports the interactions between the V2X UEs and is specified in 3GPP TS 23.285 [5] and 3GPP TS 23.287 [19].\nFigure 6.2-2 illustrates the detailed V2X application layer functional model. It enhances the simplified architectural model for the V2X application layer by specifying the functional entities at the V2X application layer.\nFigure 6.2-2 illustrates the V2X application layer functional model, which outlines the communication process between vehicles and their surroundings. The figure showcases the interaction between vehicles, roadside units (RSUs), and cloud-based servers. Key components include vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, which facilitates real-time data exchange between vehicles and infrastructure. The model highlights the role of the application layer in processing and forwarding data, ensuring efficient and secure communication for various V2X services, such as safety alerts and traffic management.\nFigure 6.2-2: V2X application layer functional model\nThe V2X application layer functional entities for the V2X UE and the V2X application server are grouped into the V2X application specific layer and the VAE layer. The VAE layer offers the VAE capabilities to the V2X application specific layer. The V2X application layer functional model utilizes the SEAL services as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6].\nThe VAE server is located in the VAE layer. The SEAL services utilized by VAE layer are location management, group management, configuration management, identity management, key management and network resource management. The V2X application specific layer consists of the V2X application specific functionalities.\nNOTE 1:\tThe functionalities of the V2X application specific layer are out of scope of the present document.\nThe V2X application server consists of the VAE server, the SEAL servers and the V2X application specific server. The VAE server provides the V2X application layer support functions to the V2X application specific server over Vs reference point. The SEAL server(s) provide the SEAL services to the V2X application specific server over SEAL-S reference point.\nThe V2X UEs consist of the VAE client, the SEAL clients and the V2X application specific client. The VAE client provides the V2X application layer support functions to the V2X application specific client over Vc reference point. The SEAL client(s) provide the SEAL services to the V2X application specific client over SEAL-C reference point.\nNOTE 2:\tIn some deployments, the client and server entities of SEAL can be part of VAE client and VAE server respectively.\nThe VAE client acts as a VAL client for its interaction with the SEAL clients as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6]. The VAE server acts as a VAL server for its interaction with the SEAL servers as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6].\nIn the VAE layer, the VAE client communicates with the VAE server over V1-AE reference point. In the V2X application specific layer, the V2X application specific client communicates with V2X application specific server over V1-APP reference point.\nNOTE 3:\tThe V1-APP reference point is out of scope of the present document.\nIn the VAE layer, the VAE client of V2X UE2 communicates with VAE client of V2X UE1 over V5-AE reference point. In the V2X application specific layer, the V2X application specific client of V2X UE2 communicates with VAE client of V2X UE1 over V5-APP reference point.\nNOTE 4:\tThe V5-APP reference point is out of scope of the present document.\nThe following SEAL services for V2X applications are supported:\n-\tLocation management as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6];\n-\tGroup management as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6];\n-\tConfiguration management as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6];\n-\tIdentity management as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6];\n-\tKey management as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6]; and\n-\tNetwork resource management as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6].\nThe VAE client interacts with SEAL clients over the SEAL-C reference point specified for each SEAL service. The VAE server interacts with SEAL servers over the SEAL-S reference point specified for each SEAL service. The interaction between the SEAL clients is supported by SEAL-PC5 reference point specified for each SEAL service. The interaction between a SEAL client and the corresponding SEAL server is supported by SEAL-UU reference point specified for each SEAL service.\nNOTE 5:\tThe SEAL-C, SEAL-S, SEAL-PC5, SEAL-UU reference points for each SEAL service is specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6].\nTo support distributed VAE server deployments, the VAE server interacts with another VAE server over VAE-E reference point.\nV2X UE1 can also act as a UE-to-network relay,\n-\tto enable VAE client on V2X UE2 to access VAE server over V1-AE reference point; and\n-\tto enable V2X application specific client on V2X UE2 to access V2X application specific server over V1-APP reference point.\nA V1-AE message can be sent over unicast, transparent multicast via xMB, transparent multicast via MB2. The non-transparent multicast via xMB (as specified in 3GPP TS 26.348 [11]) is triggered by a V1-AE message. Multicast distribution can be supported by both transparent and non-transparent multicast modes.\nThe VAE server interacts with the 3GPP network system over V2, MB2, xMB, Rx, T8, N5 and N33 reference points. The EPS and 5GS are considered as the 3GPP network system.\n",

However in some scenarios the V2X UEs are required to be determined dynamically (with the assistance of the V2X application server or independently by the V2X UEs when they are not connected to the network) during the operation. Also each V2X application group has to be mapped to a ProSe Layer-2 group ID in order to avoid any interference during PC5 communications for the V2X application groups.

The request includes the group-ID of the group for which group information update request is sent. The request also includes the updated group information (e.g. identity of V2X UE B as group leader ID) and other relevant information about the update (e.g. if the update to the group information are temporary and time bound or permanent).\n2.\tUpon receiving the Dynamic group information update request from VAE client A, the VAE server checks for the V2X user authorization to update the group information. If required, the VAE server also checks validity of the updated group information (e.g. if the request is to update the group leader ID to V2X UE B, the VAE server checks with V2X application specific server about the capabilities of the proposed group leader V2X UE B to ensure it is capable of sufficient fuel, sensors and applications to communicate and coordinate with other group members to act as group leader). If required, then the VAE server consults with V2X application specific server to ratify the updated group information or seek changes to the requested update (e.g. a different V2X UE as group leader). If the authorization fails or if the updated group information is not valid, then steps 3 to 6 are skipped.\n3.\tIf the request from the VAE client is authorized and the updated group information is valid, the VAE server acknowledges the VAE client A.\n4.\tIf the update in group information requires consent from other group member(s) (e.g. consent from the proposed new group leader, V2X UE B, to accept the role of group leader), then the VAE server obtains the consent from the user as specified in clause 9.12.6.4. This step is skipped if user consent is not required.\n5.\tThe VAE server sends the Dynamic group information update change response to VAE client A indicating success or failure. If:\n-\tthe request was authorized but the updated group information was not valid, as determined in step 2; or\n-\ta reject response to the Dynamic group information update consent request was received from VAE client B;\nthen, the VAE server may include suggestions for the updated group information (e.g. identity of the V2X UE C as potential group leader). These suggestions are based on consultation with the V2X application specific server.\n6.\tIf the group information update request was successful, the VAE server updates the group document.\n7.\tUpon successful update of the group document, the VAE server triggers a group information update notification to other group members and to the V2X application specific server.\nThe procedure for on-network dynamic group information (e.g. group leader) update is illustrated in figure 9.12.6.3-1.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe on network dynamic group has already been defined and V2X UE A and V2X UE B are members of the group;\n2.\tV2X UE A is the current group leader; and\n3.\tThe V2X application specific server has determined to update the group information (e.g., update group leader ID from identity of V2X UE A to identity of V2X UE B) and informed the updates and other relevant information about the update (e.g. if the update is temporary, like time bound, or permanent) to the VAE server to update the group information.\nFigure 9.12.6.3-1 illustrates the process of a VAE server initiating an update on network dynamic group information. The figure depicts the interaction between various network elements, including the VAE server, network dynamic group, and other network devices, during the update procedure. The VAE server plays a crucial role in managing and maintaining the network dynamic groups, ensuring efficient communication and resource allocation. The figure highlights the importance of real-time information exchange and coordination among network components to maintain network performance and reliability.\nFigure 9.12.6.3-1: VAE server initiated on network dynamic group information update procedure\n1.\tIf the update in group information requires consent from the group member(s) (e.g. consent from the proposed new group leader, V2X UE B, to accept the role of group leader), then the VAE server obtains the consent from the user as specified in clause 9.12.6.4. This step is skipped if user consent is not required.\n2.\tIf required (e.g. when group leader ID is being changed from V2X UE A to V2X UE B), the VAE server sends Dynamic group information update indication to the VAE client A about the possible update to group information.\nNOTE:\tStep 1 and step 2 can happen in parallel.\n3.\tUpon receiving the indication from the VAE server, the VAE client A notifies the V2X application specific client A about the possible update to group information.\n4.\tIf group leader information update request is successful, the VAE server updates the group document.\n5.\tUpon successful update of the group document, the VAE server triggers a Dynamic group information update notification to other group members and to the V2X application specific server.\nThe procedure for the VAE server to take consent form the user is illustrated in figure 9.12.6.4-1.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tVAE client A has initiated dynamic group information update procedure as specified in clause 9.12.6.2, or the V2X application specific server has determined to update the dynamic group information.\nFigure 9.12.6.4-1 illustrates the process of a VAE (Virtualized Access Edge) server obtaining consent from a user. The figure depicts the interaction between the VAE server and the user, highlighting the steps involved in obtaining consent, including authentication and authorization. The figure emphasizes the importance of secure and efficient communication between the VAE server and the user, ensuring that user data is protected and that access is granted only to authorized parties. The figure also highlights the role of the VAE server in managing network resources and providing a centralized point of control for user access.\nFigure 9.12.6.4-1: VAE Server taking consent from user procedure\n1.\tIf the update in group information requires consent from other group member(s) (e.g. consent from the proposed new group leader, V2X UE B, to accept the role of group leader), then the VAE server sends a dynamic group information update consent request to VAE client B. The request includes the group-ID of the group for which the request is sent. The request also includes other relevant information about the update (e.g. if the update to the group information are temporary and time bound or permanent).\n2.\tThe VAE client B notifies the V2X application specific client B about the Dynamic group information update consent request. The V2X application specific client or the V2X user decides to accept or reject the request.\n3.\tThe VAE client B sends a Dynamic group information update consent response to the VAE server. The response includes the decision whether the request is accepted or rejected.\n",

The figure showcases the server's role in the network, highlighting its interaction with various components such as the VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) and the VRU zone. The diagram emphasizes the server's ability to dynamically configure and manage network resources, ensuring efficient and secure access for VRU users.\nFigure 9.21.3-1: VAL server - triggered VRU zone configuration\n1.\tThe V2X application specific server sends a subscription request to manage the configuration of a new high-risk area zone and requires the VAE server support to translate it to a network-related zone configuration and provisioning to the UEs within the requested area.\n2.\tThe VAE server processes the request and stores the subscription. The processing includes the translation of the zone requirement of step 1 and determines a set of network-related zone parameters which indicates the configuration parameters.\n3.\tThe VAE sever sends a VRU zone management subscription response to VASS.\n4.\tThe VAE server initiates the SEAL LMS service for location tracking both for static location and dynamically changing location for all UEs within the VRU zone area. VAE server obtains and initiates tracking the V2X UEs location from the location management server 1 as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 (clause 9.3.12) or, for static area, it obtains location area monitoring information based on clause 9.3.10 of 3GPP TS 23.434.\n5.\tThe VAE server sends a notification message including the VRU zone configuration parameters. Parameters can be based on the parameters provided in step 2. This configuration will be provided to the V2X-UEs (and pedestrians) within the area that will be covered by the VRU zone.\n6.\tThe VAE server keeps monitoring the VRU zone area based on monitoring SEAL LMS events. This includes events on whether a UE (e.g. UE1) is moving in or out a target area of interest.\nThe VAE server translates the UE1 mobility event to an expected entrance to a VRU high risk zone, and based on the configuration of the zone, it identifies whether to generate and send a notification to the VASS on the expected entrance / leave of UE1.\n7.\tThe VAE server alerts the VASS that the UE1 is expected to move to the VRU zone area in a given time horizon and provides also information on its mobility as well as the UE1 capabilities (e.g. VRU capable).\n8.\tThe VAE server may also alert the VAE client (if deployed at the UE1) that it is expected to enter the VRU zone and requests the confirmation for allowing the push of VRU messages within the zone.\n",

One of the key V2P applications is the Vulnerable Road User Protection (VRUP) as specified in ETSI TS 103 300-2 [13]. VRUP provides warning to vehicles of the presence of vulnerable road users, e.g. pedestrian or cyclist, in case of dangerous situation. In VRUP, multiple V2X messages need to be exchanged between the pedestrian and the vehicular UEs, originating by one or more applications. Such messages can be standard VRU messages (e.g. VAM) and other V2X messages (CAM, DENM, BSM, CPM) and can be exchanged via different transmission modes (unicast, groupcast, broadcast).\nIn such scenario, one challenge is that a pedestrian UE might have a lower battery capacity and limited radio capability, and therefore may have to work in a low power consumption mode, e.g. not being able to send/receive V2X messages with the same periodicity as a Vehicular UE. Continuous sending/receiving V2X messages by the pedestrian UE would affect UE power efficiency. A further challenge is that multiple applications related to VRU may be deployed, which may have differentiated traffic/QoS requirements as well as transmission/reception schedules.\nThe VAE layer may provide support functionality for enabling V2P applications, by consolidating the V2P application requirements and aligning the communication traffic pattern with the PC5 QoS setting and the AS layer configurations (e.g. DRX cycles).\n",

The V2X application layer functional model as specified in clause 6 may be deployed in edge computing environment.\nFigure D-1 illustrates a V2X application layer deployment in edge computing environments.\nFigure D-1 illustrates the utilization of edge computing in a distributed network architecture, showcasing how data processing is offloaded from the central cloud to edge servers closer to the end-users. The figure depicts the flow of data from various devices, such as IoT sensors and mobile devices, to the edge servers, which are strategically placed at the network's periphery. These edge servers then process the data locally, reducing latency and bandwidth usage. The figure also highlights the role of network functions virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networking (SDN) in enabling flexible and scalable edge computing solutions.\nFigure D-1: Utilization of edge computing\nFigure D-1 illustrates the utilization of edge computing for V2X application layer based on edge enabler layer specified in 3GPP TS 23.558 [25].\nAt UE side, V2X Application Specific client(s) and VAE client interact with the Edge Enabler Client (EEC) via EDGE-5 reference point. In an Edge Data Network (EDN), V2X Application Specific Server and VAE server assume the role of EAS (Edge Application Server) and interacts with the Edge Enabler Server (EES) via EDGE-3 reference point, for instance, to register its profile into the EES. Upon service provisioning, the EEC interacts with the EES via EDGE-1 reference point, for instance, to discover V2X Application Specific Server(s) and VAE Server and further the EEC provides the discovered V2X Application Specific Server(s) and VAE server to the V2X Application Specific client and VAE client respectively. The interactions between the entities and 5GS are not shown for the sake of simplicity.\nIn an EDN, there could be several EES(s) provided by the same or different ECSP. The V2X application specific server(s), VAE server(s) and SEAL servers (e.g. GMS, NRMS, ADAES) shall be able to discover and register into an appropriate EES. If CAPIF is used, this can be done by utilizing the AEF serving area and/or the AEF location as described in 3GPP TS 23.222 [x]; otherwise, local configuration of the EES endpoint may be used.\nThe services provided by EES over EDGE-3 are not re-exposed by the VAE server or SEAL servers to the V2X application specific server but are directly consumed by the SEAL servers, VAE server and V2X application specific server(s).\nNOTE:\tThis clause illustrates an example edge deployment using edge enabler layer and there can be other valid edge deployments enabled for V2X application layer.\n\n",
