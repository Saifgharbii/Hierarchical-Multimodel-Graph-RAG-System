NSSAAF routes to the AAA-S based on the S-NSSAI, as specified in TS 33.501 [2], clause 6.13.\nThreat Reference: TBD\nTest Name: TC_NSSAAF_CORRECT_ROUTING\nPurpose:\nVerify that the NSSAAF forwards the NSSAA request to the right receiving end.\nPre-Conditions:\n-\tTest environment with AMF, AAA-S and AAA-P, which may be simulated. The NSAAF under test is connected with AMF, AAA-S and AAA-P.\n-\tA document describes the logic how the NSSAAF selects an AAA-S or AAA-P based on S-NSSAI.\n-\tPreconfigure the NSSAAF under test with two routing entries, each for a NSSAI. One of the slice is a part of MNO and the AAA-S can be directly found by the NSSAAF, while the other slice serves 3rd party and the AAA-P will be used for NSSAA procedure.\nExecution Steps\n1. The AMF sends Nssaaf_NSSAA_Authenticate Req to the NSSAAF including one of the S-NSSAI.\n2. The NSSAAF sends AAA message to an AAA-P.\n3. Repeat step 1 and 2 with the other S-NSSAI, and the NSSAAF sends AAA message to an AAA-S.\nExpected Results:\nThe NSSAAF forwards the NSSAA request to the correct AAA-S or AAA-P on the S-NSSAI.\nExpected format of evidence:\nSave the logs and the communication flow in a .pcap file.\n",

If success, the NSSAAF requests UDM for the AMF serving the UE using the Nudm_UECM_Get (GPSI, AMF Registration) service operation.
