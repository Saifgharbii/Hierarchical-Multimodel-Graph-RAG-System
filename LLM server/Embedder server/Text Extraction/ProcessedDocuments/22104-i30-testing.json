            "description": "The present document defines the principal purpose and use of different naming, numbering, addressing and identification resources (i.e. Identifiers (ID)) within the digital cellular telecommunications system and the 3GPP system.IDs that are covered by this specification includes both public IDs, private IDs and IDs that are assigned to MSs/UEs. Many of the IDs are used temporary in the networks and are allocated and assigned by the operators and some other IDs are allocated and assigned on either global, regional and national level by an administrator. See ITU-T Recommendation E.101 [122].NOTE:\tAllocation means the process of opening a numbering, naming or addressing resource in a plan for the purpose of its use by a telecommunication service under specified conditions. The allocation in itself does not yet give rights for any user, whether an operator, service provider, user or someone else, to use the resource. Assignment means authorization given to an applicant for the right of use of number, naming or addressing resources under specified conditions.The present document defines:0)\tthe principal purpose and use of International Mobile station Equipment Identities (IMEI) within the digital cellular telecommunications system and the 3GPP systema)  an identification plan for public networks and subscriptions in the 3GPP systems;b)\tprinciples of assigning telephone  numbers to MSs in the country of registration of the MS;c)\tprinciples of assigning Mobile Station (MS) roaming numbers to visiting MSs;d)\tan identification plan for location areas, routing areas, and base stations in the GSM system;e)\tan identification plan for MSCs, SGSNs, GGSNs, and location registers in the GSM/UMTS system;f)\tprinciples of assigning international mobile equipment identities;g)\tprinciples of assigning zones for regional subscription;h)\tan identification plan for groups of subscribers to the Voice Group Call Service (VGCS) and to the Voice Broadcast Service (VBS); and identification plan for voice group calls and voice broadcast calls; an identification plan for group call areas;i)\tprinciples for assigning Packet Data Protocol (PDP) addresses to mobile stations;j)\tan identification plan for point-to-multipoint data transmission groups;k)\tan identification plan for CN domain, RNC and service area in the UTRAN system.l)\tan identification plan for mobile subscribers in the WLAN system.m)\taddressing and identification for IMS Service Continuityn)\tan identification plan together with principles of assignment and mapping of identities for the Evolved Packet System; ando)\taddressing and identification for Proximity-based (ProSe) Services.p)\tan identification for Online Charging System (OCS).q)\tan identification plan together with principles of assignment and mapping of identities for the 5G System.The present document specifies functions, procedures and information which apply to GERAN Iu mode.

If so, the UDM derives the actual SUPI (IMSI) from the de-concealed SUCI (GLI/GCI).An anonymous SUCI is composed by setting the SUPI Type field to 1 (Network-Specific Identifier), using the null protection scheme, and where the scheme output corresponds to a username set to either the \"anonymous\" string or to an empty string (see IETF RFC 7542 [126], clause 2.4).The scheme output is formatted as a variable length of characters as specified for the username in clause 2.2 of IETF RFC 7542 [126].NOTE 2:\tIf the null protection scheme is used, the NFs can derive SUPI from SUCI when needed. The AMF derives SUPI used for AUSF discovery from SUCI when the Routing-Indicator is zero and the protection scheme is null.

It also allows the identification of the MME and network. It can be used by the network and the UE to establish the UE's identity during signalling between them in the EPS. See 3GPP TS 23.401 [72].The GUTI has two main components:-\tone that uniquely identifies the MME which allocated the GUTI; and-\tone that uniquely identifies the UE within the MME that allocated the GUTI.Within the MME, the mobile shall be identified by the M-TMSI.The Globally Unique MME Identifier (GUMMEI) shall be constructed from the MCC, MNC and MME Identifier (MMEI).The MMEI shall be constructed from an MME Group ID (MMEGI) and an MME Code (MMEC).The GUTI shall be constructed from the GUMMEI and the M-TMSI.For paging purposes, the mobile is paged with the S-TMSI. The S-TMSI shall be constructed from the MMEC and the M-TMSI.The operator shall need to ensure that the MMEC is unique within the MME pool area and, if overlapping pool areas are in use, unique within the area of overlapping MME pools.NOTE:\tIn some network sharing cases it is required that the MMEC and NRI values are coordinated between the sharing operators, as described in 3GPP TS 23.251 [101]. In order to achieve CS/PS coordination in shared GERAN/UTRAN networks, the MMEC included in the GUTI can be set to identify the CS operator serving the UE.The GUTI shall be used to support subscriber identity confidentiality, and, in the shortened S-TMSI form, to enable more efficient radio signalling procedures (e.g. paging and Service Request).The format and size of the GUTI is therefore the following:<GUTI> = <GUMMEI><M-TMSI>,where <GUMMEI> = <MCC><MNC><MME Identifier>and <MME Identifier> = <MME Group ID><MME Code>MCC and MNC shall have the same field size as in earlier 3GPP systems.M-TMSI shall be of 32 bits length.MME Group ID shall be of 16 bits length.MME Code shall be of 8 bits length.",

Hence, for a UE which may handover to GERAN/UTRAN (based on subscription and UE capabilities), the corresponding bits in the M-TMSI are set to '11' (see clause 2.8.2.1.3).3GPP TS 23.236 [23] specifies that the NRI field is of variable length and shall be mapped into the P-TMSI starting at bit 23 and down to bit 14. The most significant bit of the NRI is located at bit 23 of the P-TMSI regardless of the configured length of the NRI. To support mobility between GERAN/UTRAN and E-UTRAN,  the NRI length is limited to a maximum of 8 bits to be compatible for the mapping to MME Code within GUTI (see clause 2.8.2.2).The P-TMSI and NRI are defined elsewhere in this specification.In the case of a combined MME-SGSN node, the NRI of the SGSN part and the MME code of the MME part, refer to the same combined node. RAN configuration allows NAS messages on GERAN/UTRAN and E-UTRAN to be routed to the same combined node. The same or different values of NRI and MME code may be used for a combined node.This clause addresses the case when a UE moves from an MME to an SGSN. The SGSN may be either an S4 SGSN or a Gn/Gp SGSN.When a UE moves from an E-UTRAN to a GERAN/UTRAN, the UE needs to map the GUTI to an RAI, a P-TMSI and a P-TMSI Signature, for them to be sent to the SGSN. For GERAN, the TLLI is derived from the P-TMSI by the UE and is a foreign TLLI (see clause 2.6).The mapping of the GUTI shall be done to the combination of RAI of GERAN / UTRAN and the P-TMSI:E-UTRAN <MCC> maps to GERAN/UTRAN <MCC>E-UTRAN <MNC> maps to GERAN/UTRAN <MNC>E-UTRAN <MME Group ID> maps to GERAN/UTRAN <LAC>E-UTRAN <MME Code> maps to GERAN/UTRAN <RAC> and is also copied into the 8 Most Significant Bits of the NRI field within the P-TMSI;E-UTRAN <M-TMSI> maps as follows:-\t6 bits of the E-UTRAN <M-TMSI> starting at bit 29 and down to bit 24 are mapped into bit 29 and down to bit 24 of the GERAN/UTRAN <P-TMSI>;-\t16 bits of the E-UTRAN <M-TMSI> starting at bit 15 and down to bit 0 are mapped into bit 15 and down to bit 0 of the GERAN/UTRAN <P-TMSI>;-\tand the remaining 8 bits of the E-UTRAN <M-TMSI> are mapped into the 8 Most Significant Bits of the <P-TMSI signature> field.The UE shall fill the remaining 2 octets of the <P-TMSI signature> according to clauses 9.1.1, 9.4.1, 10.2.1, or 10.5.1 of 3GPP TS.33.401 [89] , as appropriate, for RAU/Attach procedures.For UTRAN, the 10-bit long NRI bits are masked out from the P-TMSI and are also supplied by the UE to the RAN node as IDNNS (Intra Domain NAS Node Selector) (see 3GPP TS 23.236 [23]). However, the RAN configured NRI length should not exceed 8 bits.A new SGSN attempts to retrieve information regarding the UE, e.g. the IMSI, from the old MME.  In order to find the UE context, the MME needs to map the RAI, P-TMSI (or TLLI) and the P-TMSI Signature (sent by the SGSN) to create the GUTI and compare it with the stored GUTI.The MME shall perform a reverse mapping to the mapping procedure specified in clause 2.8.2.1.2 \"Mapping in the UE\" (see 3GPP TS 29.060 [6] and 3GPP TS 29.274 [88] for specifics of the messaging). For the reverse mapping, the E-UTRAN <MME Code> within the GUTI shall be set either to bits 23 to 16 of the GERAN/UTRAN <P-TMSI> (i.e., the NRI field) or to the GERAN/UTRAN <RAC>. For GERAN TLLI, the old MME replaces the two topmost bits of TLLI, received from new SGSN via GTPv1, with '11' before mapping the TLLI to the GUTI used for looking up the \"UE Context\".This clause addresses the case when a UE moves from an SGSN to an MME (i.e. during a TAU or an Attach to MME). The SGSN may be either an S4 SGSN or a Gn/Gp SGSN.When the UE moves from the GERAN/UTRAN to the E-UTRAN, the UE needs to map the RAI and P-TMSI to a GUTI to be sent to the MME. The P-TMSI signature is sent intact to the MME.The mapping of P-TMSI (TLLI) and RAI in GERAN/UTRAN to GUTI in E-UTRAN shall be performed as follows:GERAN/UTRAN <MCC> maps to E-UTRAN <MCC>GERAN/UTRAN <MNC> maps to E-UTRAN <MNC>GERAN/UTRAN <LAC> maps to E-UTRAN <MME Group ID>GERAN/UTRAN <RAC> maps into bit 23 and down to bit 16 of the M-TMSIThe 8 most significant bits of GERAN/UTRAN <NRI> map to the MME code.GERAN/UTRAN <P-TMSI> maps as follows:-\t6 bits of the GERAN/UTRAN <P-TMSI> starting at bit 29 and down to bit 24 are mapped into bit 29 and down to bit 24 of the E-UTRAN <M-TMSI>;-\t16 bits of the GERAN/UTRAN <P-TMSI> starting at bit 15 and down to bit 0 are mapped into bit 15 and down to bit 0 of the E-UTRAN <M-TMSI>.The values of <LAC> and <MME group id> shall be disjoint, so that they can be differentiated.The most significant bit of the <LAC> shall be set to zero; and the most significant bit of <MME group id> shall be set to one. Based on this definition, the most significant bit of the <MME group id> can be used to distinguish the node type, i.e. whether it is an MME or SGSN. The UE copies the received old SGSN's <LAC> into the <MME Group ID> when sending a message to an MME, regardless of the value of the most significant bit of the <LAC>.\nIn networks where this definition is not applied (e.g. in networks already configured with LAC with the most significant bit set to 1 before LTE deployment), the information in the TAU/RAU request indicating whether the provided GUTI/P-TMSI  is \"native\" (i.e. no system change) or \"mapped\" (i.e. system change) can be used to distinguish the node type for UEs implemented according to this release of the specification (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [90] and 3GPP TS 24.008 [5]). Specific network implementations still satisfying 3GPP standard interfaces can be used for pre-Rel-10 UEs to distinguish the node type.NOTE 1:\tAs an example, at NAS level, the MME/SGSN can retrieve the old SGSN/MME by using additional GUTI/additional RAI/P-TMSI with double DNS query to solve the first time the UE moves between E-UTRAN and GERAN/UTRAN. As another example, the MME/SGSN can retrieve the old SGSN/MME by using double DNS query.In order to retrieve the UE's information, e.g. the IMSI, from the old SGSN, the new MME extracts only the RAI and P-TMSI from the GUTI via the reverse mapping procedure to that specified in clause 2.8.2.2.2. This is done in order to be able to include the mapped RAI and P-TMSI, along with the P-TMSI Signature received by the MME from the UE, in the corresponding message sent to the old SGSN (see 3GPP TS 29.060 [6] and 3GPP TS 29.274 [88] for specifics of the messaging). The old SGSN compares the received RAI, P-TMSI and P-TMSI Signature with the stored values for identifying the UE.",

It also allows the identification of the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) and network. It can be used by the network and the UE to establish the UE's identity during signalling between them in the 5GS. See 3GPP TS 23.501 [119].The 5G-GUTI has two main components:-\tone that identifies the AMF(s) which allocated the 5G-GUTI; and-\tone that uniquely identifies the UE within the AMF(s) that allocated the 5G-GUTI.Within the AMF(s), the mobile shall be identified by the 5G-TMSI.The Globally Unique AMF Identifier (GUAMI) shall be constructed from the MCC, MNC and AMF Identifier (AMFI).The AMFI shall be constructed from an AMF Region ID, an AMF Set ID and an AMF Pointer. The AMF Region ID identifies the region, the AMF Set ID uniquely identifies the AMF Set within the AMF Region, and the AMF Pointer identifies one or more AMFs within the AMF Set.NOTE:\tWhen the UE is assigned a 5G-GUTI with an AMF Pointer value used by more than one AMF, the AMFs need to ensure that the 5G-TMSI value used within the assigned 5G-GUTI is not already in use within the AMF's sharing that pointer value.The 5G-GUTI shall be constructed from the GUAMI and the 5G-TMSI.For paging purposes, the mobile is paged with the 5G-S-TMSI. The 5G-S-TMSI shall be constructed from the AMF Set ID, the AMF Pointer and the 5G-TMSI.The operator shall need to ensure that the combination of the AMF Set ID and AMF Pointer is unique within the AMF Region and, if overlapping AMF Regions are in use, unique within the area of overlapping AMF Regions.The 5G-GUTI shall be used to support subscriber identity confidentiality, and, in the shortened 5G-S-TMSI form, to enable more efficient radio signalling procedures (e.g. paging and Service Request).The format and size of the 5G-GUTI is therefore the following:<5G-GUTI> = <GUAMI><5G-TMSI>,where <GUAMI> = <MCC><MNC><AMF Identifier>and <AMF Identifier> = <AMF Region ID><AMF Set ID><AMF Pointer>MCC and MNC shall have the same field size as in earlier 3GPP systems.5G-TMSI shall be of 32 bits length.AMF Region ID shall be of 8 bits length.AMF Set ID shall be of 10 bits length.AMF Pointer shall be of 6 bits length.",

It is up to the operators to determine what labels shall precede the \"mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.gprs\" trailing labels (see clause 5.1.1.1 in TS 29.303 [73] and also clause 13.1 in TS 23.060 [3]).EXAMPLE 1:\tprovince1.mnc012.mcc345.gprsEXAMPLE 2:\tggsn-cluster-A.provinceB.mnc012.mcc345.gprsThe APN constructed using the APN-OI replacement field is only used for DNS translation.

A public service identity identifies a service, or a specific resource created for a service on an application server. The domain part is pre-defined by the IMS operators and the IMS system provides the flexibility to dynamically create the user part of the PSIs.The PSIs are stored in the HSS either as a distinct PSI or as a wildcarded PSI. A distinct PSI contains the PSI that is used in routing , whilst a wildcarded PSI represents a collection of PSIs. Wildcarded PSIs enable optimisation of the operation and maintenance of the nodes. A wildcarded PSI consists of a delimited regular expression located either in the userinfo portion of the SIP URI or in the telephone-subscriber portion of the Tel URI. The regular expression in the wildcarded PSI shall take the form of Extended Regular Expressions (ERE) as defined in chapter 9 in IEEE 1003.1-2004 Part 1 [60]. The delimiter shall be the exclamation mark character (\"!\"). If more than two exclamation mark characters are present in the userinfo portion or telephone-subscriber portion of a wildcarded PSI then the outside pair of exclamation mark characters is regarded as the pair of delimiters (i.e. no exclamation mark characters are allowed to be present in the fixed parts of the userinfo portion or telephone-subscriber portion).When stored in the HSS, the wildcarded PSI shall include the delimiter character to indicate the extent of the part of the PSI that is wildcarded.  It is used  to separate the regular expression from the fixed part of the wildcarded PSI.Example: The following PSI could be stored in the HSS - \"sip:chatlist!.*!@example.com\".When used on an interface, the exclamation mark characters within a PSI shall not be interpreted as delimiter..Example: The following PSIs communicated in interface messages to the HSS will match to the wildcarded PSI of \"sip:chatlist!.*!@example.com\" stored in the HSS:sip:chatlist1@example.comsip:chatlist2@example.comsip:chatlist42@example.comsip:chatlistAbC@example.comsip:chatlist!1@example.comNote that sip:chatlist1@example.com and sip:chatlist!1@example.com are regarded different specific PSIs, both matching the wildcarded PSI sip:chatlist!.*!@example.com.When used by an application server to identify a specific resource (e.g. a chat session) over Inter Operator Network to Network Interface (II-NNI), the PSI should be a SIP URI without including a port number.NOTE:\tBased on local configuration policy, a PSI can be routed over Inter Operator Network to Network Interface (II-NNI).

The value of the MCC is the same as the three digit MCC contained in the IMSI;-\tMobile Network Code (MNC) is a code identifying the PLMN in that country. The value of the MNC is the same as the two or three digit MNC contained in the IMSI;-\tTracking Area Code (TAC) is a fixed length code (of 2 octets) identifying a Tracking Area within a PLMN. This part of the tracking area identification shall be coded using a full hexadecimal representation. The following are reserved hexadecimal values of the TAC:-\t0000, and-\tFFFE.NOTE:\tThe above reserved values are used in some special cases when no valid TAI exists in the MS (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [90] for more information).A subdomain name can be derived from the TAI. This shall be done by adding the label \"tac\" to the beginning of the Home Network Realm/Domain (see clause 19.2) and encoding the TAC as a sub-domain. This is called the TAI FQDN..The TAI FQDN shall be constructed as follows:tac-lb<TAC-low-byte>.tac-hb<TAC-high-byte>.tac.epc.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3gppnetwork.orgThe TAC is a 16-bit integer. The <TAC-high-byte> is the hexadecimal string of the most significant byte in the TAC and the <TAC-low-byte > is the hexadecimal string of the least significant byte. If there are less than 2 significant digits in <TAC-high-byte> or <TAC-low-byte >, \"0\" digit(s) shall be inserted at the left side to fill the 2 digit coding.A Mobility Management Entity (MME) within an operator's network is identified using a MME Group ID (MMEGI), and an MME Code (MMEC).A subdomain name shall be derived from the MNC and MCC by adding the label \"mme\" to the beginning of the Home Network Realm/Domain (see clause 19.2).The MME node FQDN shall be constructed as:mmec<MMEC>.mmegi<MMEGI>.mme.epc.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3gppnetwork.orgWhere <MMEC> and <MMEGI> are the hexadecimal strings of the MMEC and MMEGI.An MME pool FQDN shall be constructed as:mmegi<MMEGI>.mme.epc.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3gppnetwork.orgIf there are less than 2 significant digits in <MMEC>, \"0\" digit(s) shall be inserted at the left side to fill the 2 digit coding. If there are less than 4 significant digits in <MMEGI>, \"0\" digit(s) shall be inserted at the left side to fill the 4 digit coding.The Routing Area Identity (RAI) consists of a RAC, LAC, MNC and MCC.A subdomain name for use by core network nodes based on RAI shall be derived from the MNC and MCC by adding the label \"rac\" to the beginning of the Home Network Realm/Domain (see clause 19.2).The RAI FQDN shall be constructed as:rac<RAC>.lac<LAC>.rac.epc.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3gppnetwork.org<RAC> and <LAC> shall be Hex coded digits representing the LAC and RAC codes respectively.If there are less than 4 significant digits in <RAC> or <LAC>, one or more \"0\" digit(s) is/are inserted at the left side to fill the 4 digit coding.Note:\tAbove subdomain is for release 8 core network nodes to allow DNS records other than A/AAAA records.  The subdomain name in Annex C.2 are still used for existing A/AAAA records for pre-Release 8 nodes and are also still used for backward compatibility.A specific SGSN within an operator's network is identified using the RAI FQDN (clause 19.4.2.5) and the Network Resource Identifier (NRI) (see 3GPP TS 23.236 [23]).  Such an identifier can be used by a target MME or SGSN node to connect to the source SGSN node.The SGSN FQDN shall be constructed as:nri-sgsn<NRI>.rac<RAC>.lac<LAC>.rac.epc.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3gppnetwork.org<NRI> shall be Hex coded digits representing the NRI code of the SGSN.If there are less than 4 significant digits in < NRI>, one or more \"0\" digit(s) is/are inserted at the left side to fill the 4 digit coding. Coding for other fields is the same as in Clause 19.4.2.5.When a target MME constructs the FQDN of the source SGSN in the case of SGSN pooling, it should derive the NRI from the 8-bit MME Code received in the GUTI from the UE. However, if the length of the NRI, e.g., X, which is configured in the MME is less than 8 bits, then the MME should use only the most significant X bits of the MME Code as the NRI within the SGSN FQDN.Note:\tAbove subdomain is for release 8 core network nodes to allow DNS records other than A/AAAA records.  The subdomain name in Annex C.2 are still used for existing A/AAAA records for pre-Release 8 nodes and are also still used for backward compatibility. .In the special case of  a UTRAN target RNC a possible SGSN that can control that RNC can be identified by RNC-ID.  This identifier can be used for SRNS relocation with a U-TRAN target RNC.A subdomain name for use by core network nodes based on RNC-ID  shall be derived from the MNC and MCC by adding the label \"rnc\" to the beginning of the Home Network Realm/Domain (see clause 19.2).The RNC FQDN shall be constructed as:rnc<RNC>.rnc.epc.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3gppnetwork.org<RNC> shall be Hex coded digits representing the RNC-ID code of the RNC.If there are less than 4 significant digits in <RNC>, one or more \"0\" digit(s) is/are inserted at the left side to fill the 4 digit coding.NOTE:\tAbove subdomain is for release 8 core network nodes to allow DNS records other than A/AAAA records.  The subdomain name in Annex C.3 are still used for existing A/AAAA records for pre-Release 8 nodes and are still used for backward compatibility. However, RNC-ID in Annex C.3 was originally intended for the case where only one SGSN controlled an RNC-ID and gave the SGSN IP address. The usage for the above RNC FQDN is potentially broader and can target an SGSN pool.The EPC nodes DNS subdomain (DNS zone) shall be derived from the MNC and MCC by adding the label \"node\" to the beginning of the Home Network Realm/Domain (see clause 19.2) and shall be constructed as:node.epc.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3gppnetwork.orgThis DNS subdomain is formally placed into the operator's control. 3GPP shall never take this DNS subdomain back or any zone cut/subdomain within it for any purpose. As a result the operator can safely provision any DNS records it chooses under this subdomain without concern about future 3GPP standards encroaching on the DNS names within this zone.The ePDG Fully Qualified Domain Name (ePDG FQDN), for non-emergency bearers services, shall be constructed using one of the following formats, as specified in clause 4.5.4 of 3GPP TS 23.402 [68]:-\tOperator Identifier based ePDG FQDN;-\tTracking/Location Area Identity based ePDG FQDN;-\tthe ePDG FQDN configured in the UE by the HPLMN.NOTE:\tThe ePDG FQDN configured in the UE can have a different format than those specified in the following clauses.The Visited Country FQDN is used by a roaming UE to determine whether the visited country mandates the selection of an ePDG in this country (see clause 4.5.4.5 of 3GPP TS 23.402 [68]). The Visited Country FQDN shall be constructed as specified in clause 19.4.2.9.4. The Replacement field used in DNS-based Discovery of regulatory requirements shall be constructed as specified in clause 19.4.2.9.5.The ePDG Fully Qualified Domain Name (ePDG FQDN) contains an Operator Identifier that shall uniquely identify the PLMN where the ePDG is located. The ePDG FQDN is composed of seven labels. The last three labels shall be \"pub.3gppnetwork.org\". The third and fourth labels together shall uniquely identify the PLMN. The first two labels shall be \"epdg.epc\". The ePDG FQDN shall be constructed as follows:\"epdg.epc.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.pub.3gppnetwork.org\"In the roaming case, the UE can utilise the services of the VPLMN or the HPLMN (see 3GPP TS 23.402 [68] and 3GPP TS 24.302 [77]). In this case, the Operator Identifier based ePDG FQDN shall be constructed as described above, but using the MNC and MCC of the VPLMN or the HPLMN.In order to guarantee inter-PLMN DNS translation, the <MNC> and <MCC> coding used in the \"epdg.epc. mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.pub.3gppnetwork.org\" format of the Operator Identifier based ePDG FQDN shall be:-\t<MNC> = 3 digits-\t<MCC> = 3 digitsIf there are only 2 significant digits in the MNC, one \"0\" digit shall be inserted at the left side to fill the 3 digits coding of MNC in the ePDG FQDN.As an example, the Operator Identifier based ePDG FQDN for MCC 345 and MNC 12 is coded in the DNS as:\"epdg.epc.mnc012.mcc345.pub.3gppnetwork.org\".The Tracking/Location Area Identity based ePDG FQDN is used to support location based ePDG selection within a PLMN.There are two Tracking Area Identity based ePDG FQDNs defined: one based on a TAI with a 2 octet TAC and a 5GS one based on a 3 octet TAC.1)\tThe Tracking Area Identity based ePDG FQDN using a 2 octet TAC and the Location Area Identity based ePDG FQDN shall be constructed respectively as:\"tac-lb<TAC-low-byte>.tac-hb<TAC-high-byte>.tac.epdg.epc.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.pub.3gppnetwork.org\"and\"lac<LAC>.epdg.epc.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.pub.3gppnetwork.org\"where-\tthe <MNC> and <MCC> shall identify the PLMN where the ePDG is located and shall be encoded as-\t<MNC> = 3 digits-\t<MCC> = 3 digitsIf there are only 2 significant digits in the MNC, one \"0\" digit shall be inserted at the left side to fill the 3 digits coding of MNC in the ePDG FQDN.-\tthe <TAC>, together with the <MCC> and <MNC> shall identify the Tracking Area Identity the UE is located in.\n\nThe TAC is a 16-bit integer.

A relay node vendor-specific OAM system within an operator's network is identified using the relay node type allocation code from IMEI or IMEISV (IMEI-TAC), MNC and MCC from IMSI and in some cases also tracking area code information associated to the eNB serving the relay node.A subdomain name for use by EUTRAN OAM system nodes shall be derived from the MNC and MCC by adding the label \"eutran\" to the beginning of the OAM System Realm/Domain (see clause 23.2).The vendor-specific relay node OAM system FQDN shall be constructed as following:-\ttac-lb<TAC-low-byte>.tac-hb<TAC-high-byte>.imei-tac<IMEI-TAC>.eutran-rn.oam.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3gppnetwork.orgThe IMEI-TAC is 8 decimal digits (see clause 6.2).NOTE:\tIMEI-TAC is used for the type allocation code from IMEI or IMEISV instead of TAC in this clause in order to separate it from the tracking area code (TAC).The TAC is a 16 bit integer. <TAC-high-byte> is the hexadecimal string of the most significant byte in the TAC and <TAC-low-byte > is the hexadecimal string of the least significant byte. If there are less than 2 significant digits in <TAC-high-byte> or <TAC-low-byte >, \"0\" digit(s) shall be inserted at the left side to fill the 2 digit coding.This clause describes the Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) used in Multi Vendor Plug and Connect (MvPnC) procedures (see 3GPP TS 32.508 [102]).The FQDNs used in MvPnC shall be in the form of an Internet domain name and follow the general encoding rules specified in clause 19.4.2.1.The format of FQDNs used in MvPnC shall follow the \"<vendor ID>.<system>.<OAM realm>\" pattern.NOTE: \"<vendor ID>.<system>.oam\" represents the <service_id> shown in the first row of table E.1.The <vendor ID> label is optional and is only used in the operator deployments where multiple instances of a particular network entity type are not provided by the same vendor.

In each cell the BSIC is broadcast in each burst sent on the SCH, and is then known by all MSs which synchronise with this cell. The BSIC is used by the MS for several purposes, all aiming at avoiding ambiguity or interference which can arise when an MS in a given position can receive signals from two cells using the same BCCH frequency.Some of the uses of the BSIC relate to cases where the MS is attached to one of the cells. Other uses relate to cases where the MS is attached to a third cell, usually somewhere between the two cells in question.The first category of uses includes:-\tThe three least significant bits of the BSIC indicate which of the 8 training sequences is used in the bursts sent on the downlink common channels of the cell. Different training sequences allow for a better transmission if there is interference. The group of the three least significant bits of the BSIC is called the BCC (Base station Colour Code).-\tThe BSIC is used to modify the bursts sent by the MSs on the access bursts. This aims to avoid one cell correctly decoding access bursts sent to another cell.The second category of uses includes:-\tWhen in connected mode, the MSs measure and report the level they receive on a number of frequencies, corresponding to the BCCH frequencies of neighbouring cells in the same network as the used cell. Along with the measurement result, the MS sends to the network the BSIC which it has received on that frequency. This enables the network to discriminate between several cells which happen to use the same BCCH frequency. Poor discrimination might result in faulty handovers.-\tThe content of the measurement report messages is limited to information for 6 neighbour cells. It is therefore useful to limit the reported cells to those to which handovers are accepted. For this purpose, each cell provides a list of the values of the three most significant bits of the BSICs which are allocated to the cells which are useful to consider for handovers (usually excluding cells in other PLMNs). This information enables the MS to discard information for cells with non-conformant BSICs and not to report them. The group of the three most significant bits of the BSIC is called the NCC (Network Colour Code).It should be noted that when in idle mode, the MS identifies a cell (for cell selection purposes) according to the cell identity broadcast on the BCCH and not by the BSIC.",

This usually holds for PLMNs in the same country), or2)\tThe PLMNS use different sets of NCCs, or3)\tBSIC and BCCH frequency planning is co-ordinated.Recognizing that method 3) is more cumbersome than method 2), and that method 1) is too constraining, it is suggested that overlapping PLMNs which use a common part of the spectrum agree on different NCCs to be used in any overlapping areas. As an example, a preliminary NCC allocation for countries in the European region can be found in clause A.3 of this annex.This example can be used as a basis for bilateral agreements. However, the use of the NCCs allocated in clause A.3 is not compulsory. PLMN operators can agree on different BSIC allocation rules in border areas. The use of BSICs is not constrained in non-overlapping areas, or if ambiguities are resolved by using different sets of BCCH frequencies.If the PLMNs share one or more cells with other PLMNs, the planning rule above should be applied also when the BCCH frequency is different. The rule should be respected by using different sets of NCCs. In addition to that, the PLMN sharing one or more cells with other PLMNs should use different NCCs for shared and non-shared neighbouring cells.",

            "description": "This clause describes a possible way to support inter-PLMN roaming.When an MS roams between two SGSNs within the same PLMN, the new SGSN finds the address of the old SGSN from the identity of the old RA. Thus, each SGSN can determine the address of every other SGSN in the PLMN.When an MS roams from an SGSN in one PLMN to an SGSN in another PLMN, the new SGSN may be unable to determine the address of the old SGSN. Instead, the SGSN transforms the old RA information to a logical name of the form:racAAAA.lacBBBB.mncYYY.mccZZZ.gprsA and B shall be Hex coded digits; Y and Z shall be encoded as single digits (in the range 0-9).If there are less than 4 significant digits in AAAA or BBBB, one or more \"0\" digit(s) is/are inserted at the left side to fill the 4 digit coding. If there are only 2 significant digits in YYY, a \"0\" digit is inserted at the left side to fill the 3 digit coding.As an example, the logical name for RAC 123A, LAC 234B, MCC 167 and MNC 92 will be coded in the DNS server as:\n\trac123A.lac234B.mnc092.mcc167.gprs.The SGSN may then acquire the IP address of the old SGSN from a DNS server, using the logical address. Introducing the DNS concept in GPRS enables operators to use logical names instead of IP addresses when referring to nodes (e.g. GSNs), thus providing flexibility and transparency in addressing. Each PLMN should include at least one DNS server (which may optionally be connected via the DNS service provided by the GSM Association). Note that these DNS servers are GPRS internal entities, unknown outside the GPRS system.The above implies that at least MCC || MNC || LAC || RAC (= RAI) is sent as the RA parameter over the radio interface when an MS roams to another RA.If for any reason the new SGSN fails to obtain the address of the old SGSN, the new SGSN takes the same actions as when the corresponding event occurs within one PLMN.Another way to support seamless inter-PLMN roaming is to store the SGSN IP addresses in the HLR and request them when necessary.If Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes (see 3GPP TS 23.236 [23]) is applied then the Network Resource Identifier (NRI) identifies uniquely a given SGSN node out of all the SGSNs serving the same pool area.If the new SGSN is not able to extract the NRI from the old P-TMSI, it shall retrieve the address of the default SGSN (see 3GPP TS 23.236 [23]) serving the old RA, using the logical name described earlier in this clause. The default SGSN in the old RA relays the GTP signalling to the old SGSN identified by the NRI in the old P-TMSI unless the default SGSN itself is the old SGSN.If the new SGSN is able to extract the NRI from the old P-TMSI, then it shall attempt to derive the address of the old SGSN from the NRI and the old RAI. NRI-to-SGSN assignments may be either configured (by O&M) in the new SGSN, or retrieved from a DNS server. If a DNS server is used, it shall be queried using the following logical name, derived from the old RAI and NRI information:nriCCCC.racDDDD.lacEEEE.mncYYY.mccZZZ.gprsC, D and E shall be Hex coded digits, Y and Z shall be encoded as single digits (in the range 0-9). If there are less than 4 significant digits in CCCC, DDDD or EEEE, one or more \"0\" digit(s) is/are inserted at the left side to fill the 4 digit coding. If there are only 2 significant digits in YYY, a \"0\" digit is inserted at the left side to fill the 3 digits coding.As an example, the logical name for NRI 3A, RAC 123A, LAC 234B, MCC 167 and MNC 92 will be coded in the DNS server as:\n\tnri003A.rac123A.lac234B.mnc092.mcc167.gprs.If for any reason the new SGSN fails to obtain the address of the old SGSN using this method, then as a fallback method it shall retrieve the address of the default SGSN serving the old RA.",

            "description": "This clause describes a possible way to support SRNS relocation.In UMTS, when SRNS relocation is executed, a target ID which consists of MCC, MNC and RNC ID is used as routeing information to route to the target RNC via the new SGSN. An old SGSN shall resolve a new SGSN IP address by a target ID to send the Forward Relocation Request message to the new SGSN.It shall be possible to refer to a target ID by a logical name which shall be translated into an SGSN IP address to take into account inter-PLMN handover. The old SGSN transforms the target ID information into a logical name of the form:rncXXXX.mncYYY.mccZZZ.gprsX shall be Hex coded digits; Y and Z shall be encoded as single digits (in the range 0-9). If there are less than 4 significant digits in XXXX, one or more \"0\" digit(s) is/are inserted at the left side to fill the 4 digits coding. If there are only 2 significant digits in YYY, a \"0\" digit is inserted at the left side to fill the 3 digit coding. Then, for example, a DNS server is used to translate the logical name to an SGSN IP address.As an example, the logical name for RNC 1B34, MCC 167 and MNC 92 will be coded in the DNS server as:\n\trnc1B34.mnc092.mcc167.gprsThere currently exists a private IP network between operators to provide connectivity for user transparent services that utilise protocols that rely on IP. This includes (but is not necessarily limited to) such services as GPRS/PS roaming, WLAN roaming, GPRS/PS inter-PLMN handover and inter-MMSC MM delivery. This inter-PLMN IP backbone network consists of indirect connections using brokers (known as GRXs â€“ GPRS Roaming Exchanges) and direct inter-PLMN connections (e.g. private wire); it is however not connected to the Internet. More details can be found in GSMA PRD IR.34 [57].Within this inter-PLMN IP backbone network, the domain name \".gprs\" was originally conceived as the only domain name to be used to enable DNS servers to translate logical names for network nodes to IP addresses (and vice versa). However, after feedback from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) it was identified that use of this domain name has the following drawbacks:1.\tLeakage of DNS requests for the \".gprs\" top level domain into the public Internet is inevitable at sometime or other, especially as the number of services (and therefore number of nodes) using the inter-PLMN IP backbone increases. In the worst case scenario of faulty clients, the performance of the Internet's root DNS servers would be seriously degraded by having to process requests for a top level domain that does not exist.2.\tIt would be very difficult for network operators to detect if/when DNS requests for the \".gprs\" domain were leaked to the public Internet (and therefore the security policies of the inter-PLMN IP backbone network were breached), because the Internet's root DNS servers would simply return an error message to the sender of the request only.To address the above, the IETF recommended using a domain name that is routable in the pubic domain but which requests to it are not actually serviced in the public domain. The domain name \".3gppnetwork.org\" was chosen as the new top level domain name to be used (as far as possible) within the inter-PLMN IP backbone network.Originally, only the DNS servers connected to the inter-PLMN IP backbone network were populated with the correct information needed to service requests for all sub-domains of this domain. However, it was later identified that some new services needed their allocated sub-domain(s) to be resolvable by the UE and not just inter-PLMN IP network nodes. To address this, additional, higher-level sub-domains were created:-\t\"pub.3gppnetwork.org\", which is to be used for domain names that need to be resolvable by UEs (and possibly network nodes too) that are connected to a local area network that is connected to the Internet; and-\t\"ipxuni.3gppnetwork.org\", which is to be used for domain names for UNI interfaces that need to be resolvable by UEs that are connected to a local area network that is not connected to the Internet (e.g. local area networks connected to the inter-PLMN IP network of the IPX).Therefore, DNS requests for the above domain names can be resolved, while requests for all other sub-domains of \"3gppnetwork.org\" can simply be configured to return the usual DNS error for unknown hosts (thereby avoiding potential extra, redundant load on the Internet's root DNS servers).The GSM Association is in charge of allocating new sub-domains of the \".3gppnetwork.org\" domain name. The procedure for requesting new sub-domains can be found in Annex E.When a 3GPP member company identifies the need for a new sub-domain name of \".3gppnetwork.org\", that 3GPP member company shall propose a CR to this specification at the earliest available meeting of the responsible working group for this TS. The CR shall propose a new sub-domain name. The new sub-domain proposed shall be formatted in one of the formats as described in the following table.Table E.1: Sub-domain formats for the \"3gppnetwork.org\" domain and their respective intended usageNOTE 1:\t\"<service_ID>\" is a chosen label, conformant to DNS naming conventions (usually IETF RFC 1035 [19] and IETF RFC 1123 [20]) that clearly and succinctly describe the service and/or operation that is intended to use this sub-domain.NOTE 2:\t\"<MNC>\" and \"<MCC>\" are the MNC (padded to the left with a zero, if only a 2-digit MNC) and MCC of a PLMN.NOTE 3:\t\"NID\", \"<MNC>\" and \"<MCC>\" are the NID (hexadecimal digits as specified in clause 12.7), MNC (padded to the left with a zero, if only a 2-digit MNC) and MCC identifying a Stand-alone Non-Public Network (SNPN).Care should be taken when choosing which format a domain name should use. Once a format has been chosen, the responsible working group shall then check the CR and either endorse it or reject it. If the CR is endorsed, then the responsible working group shall send an LS to the GSMA NG with TSG-CT in copy. The LS shall describe the following key points:-\tthe context-\tthe service-\tintended use-\tinvolved actors-\tproposed new sub-domain nameGSMA NG will then verify the consistence of the proposal and its usage within the domain's structure and interworking rules (e.g. access to the GRX/IPX Root DNS servers). GSMA NG will then endorse or reject the proposal and inform the responsible working group (in 3GPP) and also TSG CT. It is possible that GSMA NG will also specify, changes to the newly proposed sub-domain name (e.g. due to requested sub-domain name already allocated).NOTE 4:\tThere is no need to request GSMA NG for new labels to the left of an already GSMA NG approved \"<service_ID>\". It is the responsibility of the responsible working group to ensure uniqueness of such new labels.It should be noted that services already defined to use the \".gprs\" domain name will continue to do so and shall not use the new domain name of \".3gppnetwork.org\"; this is to avoid destabilising services that are already live.",
