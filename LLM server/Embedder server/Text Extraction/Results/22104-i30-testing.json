Automation refers to the control of processes, devices, or systems in vertical domains by automatic means. The main control functions of automated control systems include taking measurements, comparing results, computing any detected or anticipated errors, and correcting the process to avoid future errors. These functions are performed by sensors, transmitters, controllers, and actuators.\nIn the context of this document, cyber-physical systems are referred to as systems that include engineered, interacting networks of physical and computational components. Cyber-physical control applications are to be understood as applications that control physical processes. Cyber-physical control applications in automation follow certain activity patterns, which are open-loop control, closed-loop control, sequence control, and batch control (see Clause 4.2).\nCommunication services supporting cyber-physical control applications need to be ultra-reliable, dependable with a high communication service availability, and often require low or (in some cases) very low end-to-end latency.\nCommunication in automation in vertical domains follows certain communication patterns. The most well-known is periodic deterministic communication, others are aperiodic deterministic communication and non-deterministic communication (see Clause 4.3).\nCommunication for cyber-physical control applications supports operation in various vertical domains, for instance industrial automation and energy automation. This document addresses service requirements for cyber-physical control applications and supporting communication services from the vertical domains of factories of the future (smart manufacturing), electric power distribution, and central power generation. Service requirements for cyber-physical control applications and supporting communication services for rail-bound mass transit are addressed in TS 22.289 [23].\n",

                    "text_content": "Open-loop control: The salient aspect of open-loop control is the lack of feedback from the output to the control; when providing commands to an actuator, it is assumed that the output of the influenced process is predetermined and within an acceptable range. This kind of control loop works if the influences of the environment on process and actuator are negligible. Also, this kind of control is applied in case unwanted output can be tolerated [8].\nClosed-loop control: Closed-loop control enables the manipulation of processes even if the environment influences the process or the performance of the actuator changes over time. This type of control is realised by sensing the process output and by feeding these measurements back into a controller [8].\nSequence control: Sequence control may either step through a fixed sequence or employ logic that performs different actions based on various system states and system input [8]. Sequence control can be seen as an extension of both open-loop and closed-loop control, but instead of achieving only one output instance, an entire sequence of output instances can be produced [9].\nBatch control: Batch processes lead to the production of finite quantities of material (batches) by subjecting input materials to a defined order of processing actions by use of one or more pieces of equipment [10].\n",

                    "text_content": "Communication in automation can be characterised by two main attributes: periodicity and determinism.\nPeriodicity means that a transmission interval is repeated. For example, a transmission occurs every 15 ms. Reasons for a periodical transmission can be the periodic update of a position or the repeated monitoring of a characteristic parameter. Most periodic intervals in communication for automation are rather short. The transmission is started once and continuous unless a stop command is provided.\nAn aperiodic transmission is, for example, a transmission which is triggered instantaneously by an event, i.e., events are the trigger of the transmission. Events are defined by the control system or by the user. Example events are:\n-\tProcess events: events that come from the process when thresholds are exceeded or fallen below, e.g., temperature, pressure, level, etc.\n-\tDiagnostic events: events that indicate malfunctions of an automation device or module, e.g., power supply defective; short circuit; too high temperature; etc.\n-\tMaintenance events: events based on information that indicates necessary maintenance work to prevent the failure of an automation device.\nMost events, and especially alarms, are confirmed. In this context, alarms are messages that inform a controller or operator that an event has occurred, e.g., an equipment malfunction, process deviation, or other abnormal condition requiring a response. The receipt of the alarm is acknowledged usually within a short time period by the application that received the alarm. If no acknowledgment is received from the target application after a preset time, the so-called monitoring time, the alarm is sent again after a preset time or some failure response action is started.\nDeterminism refers to whether the delay between transmission of a message and receipt of the message at the destination address is stable (within bounds). Usually, communication is called deterministic if it is bounded by a given threshold for the latency/transmission time. In case of a periodic transmission, the variation of the interval is bounded.\n",

                    "text_content": "There are preferences in the mapping between the type of control and the communication pattern. Open-loop control is characterised by one or many messages sent to an actuator. These can be sent in a periodic or an aperiodic pattern. However, the communication means used need to be deterministic since typically an activity response from the receiver and/or the receiving application is expected.\nClosed-loop control produces both periodic and aperiodic communication patterns. Closed-loop control is often used for the control of continuous processes with tight time-control limits, e.g., the control of a printing press. In this case, one typically relies on periodic communication patterns. Note that in both the aperiodic and periodic case, the communication needs to be deterministic.\nLogging of device states, measurements, etc. for maintenance purposes and such typically entails aperiodic communication patterns. In case the transmitted logging information can be time-stamped by the respective function, determinism is often not mandatory.\nIn practice, vertical communication networks serve a large number of applications exhibiting a wide range of communication requirements. In order to facilitate efficient modelling of the communication network during engineering and for reducing the complexity of network optimisation, traffic classes or communication patterns have been identified [6]. There are three typical traffic classes or communication patterns in industrial environments [6], i.e.,\n-\tdeterministic periodic communication: periodic communication with stringent requirements on timeliness of the transmission.\n-\tdeterministic aperiodic communication: communication without a preset sending time. Typical activity patterns for which this kind of communication is suitable are event-driven actions.\n-\tnon-deterministic communication: subsumes all other types of traffic, including periodic non-real time and aperiodic non-real time traffic. Periodicity is irrelevant in case the communication is not time-critical.\nSome communication services exhibit traffic patterns that cannot be assigned to one of the above communication patterns exclusively (mixed traffic).\n",

While many use cases have similar KPI values, the important distinction is that in order to meet the needs of different verticals and different uses, the 5G system will need to be sufficiently flexible to allow deployment configurations that can meet the different sets of KPIs specific to each use.\nCommunication service availability is considered an important service performance requirement for cyber-physical applications, especially for applications with deterministic traffic. The communication service availability depends on the latency and reliability (in the context of network layer packet transmissions, as defined in TS 22.261 [2]) of the logical communication link, as well as the survival time of the cyber-physical application (see Annex C.3 for further details on these relations).\nThe communication service reliability requirements also depend on the operation characteristics of the corresponding cyber-physical applications. Typically, the communication services critical for the automation application also come with stringent communication service reliability requirements. Note that the communication service reliability requirement has no direct relationship with the communication service availability requirement.\nThe \"# of UEs\" in the tables in clauses 5.2 to 5.5 is intended to give an indication of the UE density that would need to be served within a given service area.\nClock synchronisation is needed in many \"vertical\" use cases. The requirements and tables in Clause 5.6 provide specific criteria for managing time sensitive communications in an industrial environment.\nHigh accuracy positioning is becoming essential for Factories of the Future. The reason for this is that tracking of mobile devices as well as mobile assets is becoming increasingly important in improving processes and increasing flexibility in industrial environments, Clause 5.7 provides positioning requirements for horizontal and vertical accuracy, availability, heading, latency and UE speed in an industrial use case scenario.\nAn example of the relationship between reliability (in the context of network layer packet transmissions, as defined in TS 22.261 [2]), survival time and communication service availability of a logical communication link is illustrated in the following Table 5.1-1. This is done for a special case where packet errors are uncorrelated, which in many cases is an unrealistic assumption.\nTable 5.1-1: Example of relationship between reliability (as defined in TS 22.261) and communication service availability when the survival time is equal to the transfer interval.\n\n",

                    "summary": "",
                    "text_content": "The manufacturing industry is currently subject to a fundamental change, which is often referred to as the \"Fourth Industrial Revolution\" or simply \"Industry 4.0\" [15]. The main goals of Industry 4.0 are―among others―the improvement of flexibility, versatility, resource efficiency, cost efficiency, worker support, and quality of industrial production and logistics. These improvements are important for addressing the needs of increasingly volatile and globalised markets. A major enabler for all this is cyber-physical production systems based on a ubiquitous and powerful connectivity, communication, and computing infrastructure. The infrastructure interconnects people, machines, products, and all kinds of other devices in a flexible, secure and consistent manner. Several different application areas can be distinguished:\n1)\tFactory automation: Factory automation deals with the automated control, monitoring and optimisation of processes and workflows within a factory. This includes aspects like closed-loop control applications (e.g., based on programmable logic or motion controllers) and robotics, as well as aspects of computer-integrated manufacturing. Factory automation generally represents a key enabler for industrial mass production with high quality and cost-efficiency. Corresponding applications are often characterised by highest requirements on the underlying communication infrastructure, especially in terms of communication service availability, determinism, and latency. In the Factories of the Future, static sequential production systems will be more and more replaced by novel modular production systems offering a high flexibility and versatility. This involves many increasingly mobile production assets, for which powerful wireless communication and localisation services are required.\n2)\tProcess automation: Process automation refers to the control of production and handling of substances like chemicals, food & beverage, pulp, etc. Process automation improves the efficiency of production processes, energy consumption, and safety of the facilities. Sensors measuring process values, such as pressures or temperatures, are working in closed loops via centralised and decentralised controllers. In turn, the controllers interact with actuators, e.g., valves, pumps, heaters. Also, monitoring of attributes such as the filling levels of tanks, quality of material, or environmental data are important, as well as safety warnings or plant shut downs. Workers in the plant are supported by mobile devices. A process automation facility may range from a few 100 m² to several km², and the facility may be geographically distributed. Depending on the size, a production plant may have several 10,000 measurement points and actuators. Autarkic device power supply for years is needed in order to stay flexible and to keep the total costs of ownership low.\n3)\tHMIs and production IT: Human-machine interfaces (HMIs) include all sorts of devices for the interaction between people and production facilities, such as panels attached to a machine or production line, but also standard IT devices, such as laptops, tablet PCs, smartphones, etc. In addition, augmented- and virtual-reality applications are expected to play an increasingly important role in future.\n4) \tLogistics and warehousing: Organisation and control of the flow and storage of materials and goods in the context of industrial production. In this respect, intra-logistics is dealing with logistics within a certain property (e.g., within a factory), for example by ensuring the uninterrupted supply of raw materials on the shop floor level using automated guided vehicles (AGVs), fork-lifts, etc. This is to be seen in contrast to logistics between different sites. Warehousing particularly refers to the storage of materials and goods, which is also getting more and more automated, for example based on conveyors, cranes and automated storage and retrieval systems.\n5)\tMonitoring and maintenance: Monitoring of certain processes and/or assets in the context of industrial production without an immediate impact on the processes themselves (in contrast to a typical closed-loop control system in factory automation, for example). This particularly includes applications such as condition monitoring and predictive maintenance based on sensor data, but also big data analytics for optimising future parameter sets of a certain process, for instance. For these use cases, the data acquisition process is typically not latency-critical.\nFor each of these application areas, a multitude of potential use cases exists, some of which are outlined in the following subclauses. These use cases can be mapped to the given application areas (see Table A.2.1-1).\nTable A.2.1-1: Mapping of the considered use cases (columns) to application areas (rows)\n\n",

A motion controller periodically sends desired set points to one or several actuators (e.g., a linear actuator or a drive) which thereupon perform a corresponding action on one or several processes (in this case usually a movement or rotation of a certain component). At the same time, sensors determine the current state of the process(es), e.g. the current position and/or rotation of one or multiple components, and send the actual values back to the motion controller. This is done in a strictly cyclic and deterministic manner, such that during one application cycle the motion controller sends updated set points to all actuators, and all sensors send their actual values back to the motion controller.

A mobile robot essentially is a programmable machine able to execute multiple operations, following programmed paths to fulfil a large variety of tasks. This means, a mobile robot can perform activities like assistance in work steps, collaboration with other robots, e.g. for car assembly, and transport of goods, materials and other objects. Mobile robot systems are characterised by a maximum flexibility in mobility relative to the environment, with a certain level of autonomy and perception ability, i.e., they can sense and react with their environment.\nAutonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) are a sub-group of mobile robots. AGVs are driverless and used for moving materials efficiently within a facility. A detailed overview of the state of the art of autonomous-guided-vehicle systems is provided elsewhere in the literature [16]. All mobile robots incorporate all functionalities needed for an AGV.\nToday, the AGV’s control intelligence is hosted inside the AGV. In the future, centralised fleet control will be hosted in the edge cloud, which will require reliable wireless communication between the control entity and all AGVs. Also, the current paradigm of pre-describing a route for the AGV will be replaced with target-based navigation. This paradigm change will make AGV routes more flexible.\nMobile robots are monitored and controlled from a guidance control system. Radio-controlled guidance control is necessary to get up-to-date process information, to avoid collisions between mobile robots, to assign driving jobs to the mobile robots, and to manage the traffic of mobile robots. The mobile robots are track-guided by the infrastructure with markers or wires in the floor or guided by own surround sensors, like cameras and laser scanners.\nMobile robot systems can be divided in operation in indoor, outdoor and both indoor and outdoor areas. These environmental conditions have an impact on the requirements of the communication system, e.g., the handover process, to guarantee the required cycle times.\nWhere this document does not explicitly refer to AGVs, the term mobile robots applies to AGVs as well as to mobile robots.\n\nTable A.2.2.3-1: Service performance requirements for mobile robots\n\nUse case one\nPeriodic communication for the support of precise cooperative robotic motion control (transfer interval: 1 ms), machine control (transfer interval: 1 ms to 10 ms), co-operative driving (10 ms to 50 ms).\nUse case two\nPeriodic communication for video-operated remote control.\nUse case three\nPeriodic communication for standard mobile robot operation and traffic management.\nUse case four\nReal-time streaming data transmission (video data) from a mobile robot to the guidance control system.\nAdditional information\nAGVs have the following needs.\n–\tThe direct-device control is time-critical since the communication involves safety-relevant functions such as emergency stop and the avoidance of obstacles.\n–\tFor the implementation of swarm intelligence, position and availability information are needed. A possible route change due to a blocked route affects the routes of all other AGVs that will follow. The communication is less time-critical than for safety-relevant functions.\n–\tCamera-based navigation requires high data rates. Examples for camera-based navigation are the positioning of boxes/containers, detection of persons and obstacles, as well as creation and administration of a map for flexible navigation. Note that sensor-based navigation requires lower data rates than camera-based navigation.\n\nMobile robots have additional needs.\n–\tThe mobile robot provides an additional service during transport (for instance quality inspection, scanning of surroundings, asset identification, carrying of work pieces). In order to reduce the uplink data rate, pre-compression of data is possible directly on the device. The communication is not or at least less time-critical than the motion control of the mobile robot.\n–\tThe mobile robot needs to interact with the periphery (for instance intelligent storage racks, stationary robots, and moving machines). This communication is time-critical. Interaction with the periphery can be relevant at the start point, end point, and also at several intermediate stations (for instance the collection of parts from intelligent storage racks). The exact position and orientation can be determined by a centering station and the AGV sensors. Additional scanning by the robot with a video camera may be necessary.\n\n",

These panels are mainly used for configuring, monitoring, debugging, controlling and maintaining machines, robots, cranes or complete production lines. In addition to that, (safety) control panels are typically equipped with an emergency stop button and an enabling device, which an operator can use in case of a safety event in order to avoid damage to humans or machinery. When the emergency stop button is pushed, the controlled equipment immediately comes to a safe stationary position. Likewise, if a machine, robot, etc. is operated in the so-called special ‘enabling device mode’, the operator manually keeps the enabling device switch in a special stationary position. If the operator pushes this switch too much or releases it, the controlled equipment immediately comes to a safe stationary position as well. This way, it can be ensured that the hand(s) of the operator are on the panel (and not under a moulding press, for example), and that the operator does―for instance―not suffer from any electric shock or the like. A common use case for this ‘enabling device mode’ is the installation, testing or maintenance of a machine, during which other safety mechanisms (such as a safety fence) are deactivated.\nDue to the criticality of these safety functions, safety control panels currently have mostly a wire-bound connection to the equipment they control. In consequence, there tend to be many such panels for the many machines and production units that typically can be found in a factory. With an ultra-reliable low-latency wireless link, it would be possible to connect such mobile control panels with safety functions wirelessly. This would lead to a higher usability and would allow for the flexible and easy re-use of panels for controlling different machines.\nThe cycle times of the control application depends on the process/machinery/equipment whose safety has to be ensured.

However, due to the envisaged high flexibility and versatility of the Factories of the Future, shop floor workers should be optimally supported in getting quickly prepared for new tasks and activities and in ensuring smooth operations in an efficient and ergonomic manner. To this end, augmented reality may play a crucial role, for example for the following applications:\n-\tmonitoring of processes and production flows;\n-\tstep-by-step instructions for specific tasks, for example in manual assembly workplaces;\n-\tad hoc support from a remote expert, for example for maintenance or service tasks.\nIn this respect, especially head-mounted augmented-reality devices with see-through display are very attractive since they allow for a maximum degree of ergonomics, flexibility and mobility and leave the hands of workers free for other tasks. However, if such augmented-reality devices are worn for a longer period (e.g., one work shift), these devices have to be lightweight and highly energy-efficient while at the same time they should not become very warm. A very promising approach is to offload complex (e.g., video) processing tasks to the network (e.g., an edge cloud) and to reduce the augmented-reality head-mounted device’s functionality. This has the additional benefit that the augmented-reality application may have easy access to different context information (e.g., information about the environment, production machinery, the current link state, etc.) if executed in the network.\nTable A.2.4.2-1: Service performance requirements for augmented reality in human-machine interfaces\n\nUse case one\nBi-directional message transmission between an augmented-reality device and an image processing server.\n",

There are self-healing solutions for automated switching, fault isolation, and service restoration. Furthermore, these solutions are ideally suited to handle outages that affect critical power consumers, such as industrial plants or data centres.

Automated solutions are able to restore power supply within a few hundred milliseconds.\n[Description of image generated by vision LM]\nFigure A.4.4.1-1: Depiction of a distribution ring and a failure (flash of lighting)\nThe FLISR (Fault Location, Isolation & Service Restoration) solution consists of switch controller devices which are especially designed for feeder automation applications that support the self-healing of power distribution grids with overhead lines. They serve as control units for reclosers and disconnectors in overhead line distribution grids.\nThe system is designed for using fully distributed, independent automated devices. The logic resides in each individual feeder automation controller located at the poles in the feeder level. Each feeder section has a controller device. Using peer-to-peer communication among the controller devices, the system operates autonomously without the need of a regional controller or control centre. However, all self-healing steps carried out will be reported immediately to the control centre to keep the grid status up to date. The controllers conduct self-healing of the distribution line in typically 500 ms by isolating the faults.\nPeer-to-peer communication via IEC 61850 GOOSE (Generic Object Oriented Substation Event) messages provides data as fast as possible (Layer 2 multicast message). They are sent periodically (in steady state, with changing interval time in fault case) by each controller to several or all other controllers of the same feeder and are not acknowledged.\nThe service bit rate per controller is low in steady state, but GOOSE bursts with high service bit rate do occur, especially during fault situations. GOOSE messages are sent by several or all controller units of the feeder nearly at the same point in time during the fault location, isolation and service restoration procedure with a low end-to-end latency.\nThe associated (a)periodic communication KPIs are provided in Table A4.4.1-1.\nTable A.4.4-1.1: Service performance requirements for distributed automated switching for isolation and service restoration\n\nUse case one\nGOOSE (a)periodic deterministic communication service supporting bursty message exchange for fault location, isolation, and service restoration.\nUse case two\nTypically event-driven, aperiodic deterministic communication service supporting fault detection and isolation.\n",

Distributed power generation typically comes with a low power density and entails thus typicall a decentralised deployment. Decentralisation causes technical problems and challenges Smart Grid operators. When distributed power generation is connected to the elctrical grid, the energy flow becomes more complicated as the user often is both an electricity consumer and producer (a so-called “prosumer”). Therefore, the current in the electricity grid can change direction at different locations of the grid and at different times of the day.\nThe information exchange in a distributed energy grid does not only include power-generation-related data, but also control commands for the distributed energy storage equipment. An example for such a command is “change the load characteristics to realise a flexible electricity grid” etc.\n[Description of image generated by vision LM]\nFigure A.4.6-1 Example of a distributed-energy storage grid\nFigure A.4.6-1 shows an example of distributed-energy storage grid. The distributed-energy storage grid needs to exchange information among the distributed-energy storage management platform (DESMP) and distributed-energy devices (DEDs).\nThe DED is a plug-and-play device and periodically collects its energy information, such as battery energy, charge and discharge status, energy alarm information, etc. The DED then transfers this information via 5G UE to the DESMP. The DESMP regularly manages the DEDs, e.g., the DESMP monitors the DEDs working status, controls the DEDs working modes, or configures the DEDs energy parameters etc. The associated KPIs are provided in Table A.4.6-1.\n\nTable A.4.6-1: Communication service performance requirements ‒ data for distributed energy storage\nUse case#1: Distributed energy storage ‒ periodic communication for monitoring\nUse case#2: Distributed energy storage ‒ periodic communication for data collection\nUse case#3: Distributed energy storage ‒ aperiodic video communication\n",

Smart meter units can send real-time metering data to a server in the utility through mobile networks. In this way, the power enterprise―based on the analysis of the user’s power consumption behavior―gives the user power consumption suggestions, which fosters the user’s power consumption and energy saving habits.\nThe electric smart meters monitor relevant user energy status and deliver the status data to a measurement data management system (MDMS). The MDMS sends control commands according to its policy and the status of the data collected from the smart meters. The MDMS commands include tripping, closing permission, alarm, alarm release, power protection, and power protection release. Accurate-fee control is one of the basic services of advanced metering. When the electric power user doesn’t pay her electric fee on time, the MDMS can cut off the power supply. And when there is a need for temporary power supply for this user, the MDMS can recover the power supply. This operation requires real-time interaction between the electric smart meter and the MDMS. Due to massive number of electricity meters, it is estimated that in the near future, the amount of this kind of interaction will increase 5 to 10 times.

The potentially large number of DERs will have an impact on security, stability, and operation efficiency of the energy grid.\nThe integration of DERs into the energy grid poses many challenges for the involved communication system. To incorporate more renewable and alternative energy sources, the communication infrastructure must have the ability to easily handle an increasing amount of data traffic or service requests and must provide a real-time monitoring and control operation for these distributed energy resources. A reliable communication between the DERs is crucial.\nWhen it comes to communications architecture, IEC 61850 is a widely used standard for automation and equipment of power utilities and DER, specifically for defining protocols for IEDs (Intelligent electronic devices) at electrical substations The IEC 61850 standard specifies the timing constraints for messages typically used in substations. GOOSE (Generic Object Oriented Substation Events) and SV (Sampled Values) messages are assumed as time critical messages. They have the tightest deadlines (maximum allowed transfer time) among all IEC 61850 messages, corresponding to 3 ms. While GOOSE is typically used for transfering information related to monitoring and control functions (circuit breaker status etc.), SV is used for transfering measurement samples of current and voltage signals. The SV protocol works on a periodic information transmission model, sending messages at a fixed rate. For protection purposes, the default rate is 4000 or 4800 messages per second for 50 and 60 Hz power systems, respectively. On the other hand, the GOOSE protocol operates in a sporadic information transmission model, where a continuous flow of data is maintained to increase communication reliability. The typical sizes of GOOSE and SV messages are160 and 140 bytes, respectively. GOOSE messages are transmitted in two different modes: (1) safe operation: 1 message per second (service bit rate = 1.28 kbit/s); (2) emergency operation: 32 messages per second (service bit rate = 41.0 kbit/s). SV messages are transmitted at much higher rate, namely 4800 messages per second (service bit rate = 5.4 Mbit/s).

The idea is to prioritise Smart Grid-related communication in order to ensure reliable and available communication for selected devices during emergency conditions.

It is achieved through complex systems that translate the surgeon’s hand movements into smaller, precise movements of tiny instruments that can generally bend and rotate far more than a human hand is capable of doing inside the patient’s body. In addition, those systems are usually able to filter out hand tremor and therefore allow more consistent outcomes for existing procedures, and more importantly the development of new procedures currently made impractical by the accuracy limits of unaided manipulation.\nA typical robotic setup for telesurgery can be depicted as follows.\n[Description of image generated by vision LM]\nFigure A.6.2-1: Typical Robotic Surgery System Setup\nThe robot and the surgeon’s console can be co-located in the same operating room in which case they communicate through a NPN, or, in another deployment option, when specialists and patients are far from each other (hundreds of kilometres) they can exchange data through communication services delivered by PLMNs. The depicted medical application can be instantiated at either side or in the Cloud.

This allows to provide tactile guidance by constraining where the instruments (scalpel, etc.) can go.\n-\tFiltering motion control commands for better closed loop stability\nTypical surgery robotic systems can have around 40 actuators and the same number of sensors which allows to compute the data rate requires in each direction in order to execute a given movement.\nHuman sensitivity of touch is very high, tactile sensing has about 400 Hz bandwidth, where bandwidth refers to the frequency of which the stimuli can be sensed. This is why, in general, haptic feedback systems operate at frequencies around 1,000 Hz. This rate naturally applies to the update of all information used in the generation of the haptic feedback, e.g. instruments velocity, position … Therefore, the robot control process involves:\n-\tThe surgeon console periodically sending a set of points to actuators\n-\tActuators executing a given process\n-\tSensors sampling velocity, forces, positions, … at the very same time and returning that information to the surgeon console at the rate of 1 kHz\nAs opposed to machine to machine communication, robotic aided surgery implies there is a human being in the middle of the control loop, which means that the console generates new commands based on the system state collected in the previous 1 kHz cycle and also on surgeon’s hand movement.\nEach equipment involved in a robotic telesurgery setup (endoscopes, image processing system, displays, motion controller and haptic feedback systems) is synchronized thanks to a common clock either external or provided by the 5G system. The synchronization is often achieved through dedicated protocols such as e.g. PTP version 2 and allows to e.g. guarantee the consistency of the haptic feedback and displayed images at the master console, or enable the recording and offline replay of the whole procedure.\n\n\nTable A.6.2-1: Service performance requirements for motion control and haptic feedback\n\nUse case one\nPeriodic communication for the support of precise cooperative robotic motion control and haptic feedback in case of robotic aided surgery where the surgeon console and the robot are collocated in the same operating room\nUse case two\nPeriodic communication for the support of cooperative robotic motion control and haptic feedback in case of telesurgery.

In the best case all relevant goods and products are continuously tracked from the moment they are received to the moment they are made available. The tracking process provides the relevant context information that is needed for real-time control and optimization of the material flow and subsequent production processes. In this scenario, autonomous driving systems fetch parts from the warehouse independently and transport them to flexible assembly cells on the shop floor. As part of the flexible fleet management system, these autonomous driving systems are continuously localized and move quickly and in constant interaction with their environment. In the process, production machinery and assembly cells and their given status are monitored seamlessly while relevant objects like tools and workpieces being localized. This makes it possible to adapt quickly to changes in circumstances. The result is flexible, autonomously controlled production that is capable of adapting to new situations at any time.

This definition is illustrated in Figure C.1.1-1.\n[Description of image generated by vision LM]\nNOTE:\tBlue objects: communication system; other objects: automation application system.\nFigure C.1.1-1: Abstract diagram of the area of consideration for industrial radio communication\nHere, a distributed automation application system is depicted. This system includes a distributed automation application, which is the aggregation of several automation functions. These can be functions in sensors, measurement devices, drives, switches, I/O devices, encoders etc. All of these functions contribute toward the control of physical objects. Field bus systems, industrial Ethernet systems, or wireless communication systems can be used for connecting the distributed functions. The essential function of these communication systems is the distribution of messages among the distributed automation functions. For cyber-physical control applications, the dependability of the entire communication system and/or of its devices or its links is essential. Communication functions are realised by the respective hardware and software implementation.\nIn order for the automation application system to operate, messages need to be exchanged between spatially distributed application functions. For that process, messages are exchanged at an interface between the automation application system and the communication system. This interface is termed the reference interface. Required and guaranteed values for characteristic parameters, which describe the behavioural properties of the radio communication system, as well as some influence quantities refer to that interface.\nThe conditions that influence the behaviour of wireless communication are framed by the communication requirements of the application (e.g., end-to-end latency), the characteristics of the communication system (e.g., output power of a transmitter), and the transmission conditions of the media (e.g., signal fluctuations caused by multipath propagation).\nGeneral requirements from the application point of view for the time and failure behaviour of a communication system are mostly related to an end-to-end link. It is assumed in the present document that the behaviour of the link is representative of the communication system as a whole and of the entire scope of the application.\n",

Logical end points are elements of the reference interface, which may group several logical end points together.\nThe intended function of the logical link is the transmission of a sequence of messages from a logical source end point to the correct logical target end point. This is achieved by transforming each message into a form that fosters error-free transmission. The transmission process includes certain processes, for instance repetitions, in order to fulfil the intended function. After transmission, the transported package(s) is converted back into a message. The message is to be available and correct at the target within a defined time. The sequence of messages at the target is to be the same as the sequence at the source.\nThe functional units, which are necessary to fulfil this function are shown, in Figure C.1.2.1-1.\n[Description of image generated by vision LM]\nFigure C.1.2.1-2: The asset \"logical link\"\nThe required function can be impaired by various influences, which can lead to communication errors.

The communication system is in the \"available\" state as long as the availability criteria for transmitted packets are met. The service is unavailable if the packets received at the target are impaired and/or untimely (e.g. update time > stipulated maximum). If the survival time (see Table C.2.3-1) is larger than zero, consecutive impairments and/or delays are ignored until the respective time has expired.\nEnd-to-end latency\nThis parameter indicates the time allotted to the communication system for transmitting a message and the permitted timeliness.\nCommunication service reliability\nMean time between failures is one of the typical indicators for communication service reliability. This parameter states the mean value of how long the communication service is available before it becomes unavailable. For instance, a mean time between failures of one month indicates that a communication service runs error-free for one month on average before an error/errors make the communication service unavailable. Usually, an exponential distribution is assumed. This means, there will be several failures where the time between two subsequent errors is below the mean value (1 month in the example).\nCommunication service availability and communication service reliability (mean time between failures) give an indication on the time between failures and the length of the failures.\nService bit rate\na) deterministic communication\nThe target value indicates committed data rate in bit/s sought from the communication service. This is the minimum data rate the communication system guarantees to provide at any time, i.e. in this case target value = user experienced data rate.\nb) non-deterministic communication\nThe target value indicates the target data rate in bit/s. This is the information rate the communication system aims at providing on average during a given (moving) time window (unit: s). The user experienced data rate the lower data rate threshold for any of the time windows.\nUpdate time\nApplicable only to periodic communication, the update time indicates the time interval between any two consecutive messages delivered from the egress (of the communication system) to the application.\nTraffic classes\nIn practice, vertical communication networks serve applications exhibiting a wide range of communication requirements. In order to facilitate efficient modelling of the communication network during engineering, and for reducing the complexity of network optimisation, disjoint QoS sets have been identified. These sets are referred to as traffic classes [6]. Typically, only three traffic classes are needed in industrial environments [6], i.e.\n-\tdeterministic periodic communication;\n-\tdeterministic aperiodic communication; and\n-\tnon-deterministic communication.\nDeterministic periodic communication stands for periodic communication with stringent requirements on timeliness of the transmission.\nDeterministic aperiodic communication stands for communication without a pre-set sending time. Typical activity patterns for which this kind of communication is suitable are event-driven actions.\nNon-deterministic communication subsumes all other types of traffic. Periodic non-real time and aperiodic non-real time traffic are subsumed by the non-deterministic traffic class, since periodicity is irrelevant in case the communication is not time-critical.\nUsage of the parameters in Table C.2.2-1\nControl service request and response; monitoring service response and indication.\n",

In this case, the ingress data rate exceeds the capacity of the network, which implies that some of the data has to be stored within the ingress node of the communication system before it can be transmitted to the egress interface(s). However, the application consuming the communication service requires that the data of such a burst needs to be transmitted completely. This is in contrast to periodic data transmission, where new messages overwrite old ones.\nTypical metrices for bursts: maximum user data length and line rate of the communication service interface.\nMessage size\nThe user data length indicates the (maximum) size of the user data packet delivered from the application to the ingress of the communication system and from the egress of the communication system to the application. For periodic communication this parameter can be used for calculating the requested user-experienced data rate. If this parameter is not provided, the default is the maximum value supported by the PDU type (e.g. Ethernet PDU: maximum frame length is 1,522 octets, IP PDU: maximum packet length is 65,535 octets).\nService time interval\nDescribes the start and end time of a communication service. Note that there are other ways to describe the service time interval numerically, for instance as the tuple [start time, service duration].\nSurvival time\nThe maximum survival time indicates the time period the communication service may not meet the application's requirement before the communication service is deemed to be in an unavailable state.\nNOTE 1:\tThe survival time indicates to the communication service the time available to recover from failure.

As far as timely received messages are correct, the logical communication link status is up. If a message loss or an incorrectly or untimely received message is detected the logical communication link status is down. To denote up and down states the terms “up time interval” and “down time interval”, or alternatively “available” and “unavailable” may be used. An example of the relation between logical communication link status, communication service status and application status is presented in Figure C.3-1.\n\nFigure C.3-1: Relation between logical communication link, communication service and application statuses (example with lost messages)\nThe flow of events in Figure C.3-1 is as follows:\na)\tThe logical communication link is up and running (blue line is UP). A source device starts sending periodic messages to a target device (orange arrows), on which an automation function (application) is running. The communication service is, from the point of view of the target application, in an up state (violet line is UP) and so is the application (green line is UP).\nb)\tThe logical communication link status changes to down state if it no longer can support end-to-end transmission of the source device's messages to the target device in agreement with the negotiated communication requirements. Once the application on the target device senses the absence (or unsuccessful reception) of expected messages (\"Deadline for expected message\" in Figure C.3-1), it will wait a pre-set period before it considers the communication service to be unavailable ; this is the so-called survival time. The survival time can be expressed as\n-\t\ta period or,\n-\tespecially with cyclic traffic, as maximum number of consecutive incorrectly received or lost messages.\nc)\tIf the survival time has been exceeded, both the communication service and the application transition into a down state (violet and green lines change to DOWN in Figure C.3-1). The application will usually take corresponding actions for handling such situations of unavailable communication services. For instance, it will commence an emergency shutdown. Note that this does not imply that the target application is \"shut off\"; rather it transitions into a pre-defined state, e.g. a safe state. In the safe state, the target application might still listen to incoming packets or may try to send messages to the source application.\nd)\tOnce the logical communication link status is in the up state again (blue line in Figure C.3-1 changes to UP), the communication service state as perceived by the target application will change to the up state. The communication service is thus again perceived as available (violet line changes to UP in Figure C.3-1). The state of the application, however, depends on the counter measures taken by the application. The application might stay in down state if it is in a safe state due to an emergency shutdown. Or, the application may do a recovery and change to up state again. The time needed for the application to return to the up state after the communication service is restored is shown as “Application recovery time” in Figure C.3-1.\nThe availability of the communication service is calculated using the accumulated down time. For instance, in case the communication service is expected to run for a time T, the unavailability U of the communication service can be calculated as\n[Description of image generated by vision LM]\nWhere Δti is the length of the i-th downtime interval of the communication service within the time period T. The communication service availability A can then be calculated as\nA = 1–U.\n",

What is needed is a concept and related parameters that allow for formulating and talking about the end-to-end latency requirements in Clause 5 and Annex A.\nThe most important attribute is timeliness. Timeliness can be formulated a permitted interval for the actual value of the time parameter. Accuracy, earliness and lateness describe the allowed deviation from a target value.

In other words, a strict time boundary applies: [minimum end-to-end latency, maximum end-to-end latency]. Otherwise, the transmission is erroneous. Although most use cases that require timely delivery only specify the maximum end-to-end latency, the minimum latency is also sometimes prescribed. In the latter case, a communication error occurs if the packet is delivered earlier than the minimum end-to-end latency. An example for a related application is putting labels at a specific location on moving objects, and the arrival of a message is interpreted as a trigger for this action.

            "description": "This section clarifies the wording and terminology with respect to communication interfaces that are relevant for vertical applications. Because the 3GPP network does not cover the complete ISO-OSI communication stack, it is important to distinguish between\n-\tthe vertical applications’ point of view, and\n-\tthe 3GPP network’s point of view.\nIn this section, the relation between those two is clarified.\nFigure C.5-1 shows a simplified version of the communication stack. The PHY layer, the MAC layer and some parts of the IP layer are part of the 3GPP network. The layers that are part of the 3GPP network are referred to as lower communication layers (LCL). The communication stack also includes an application. The OSI layers related to providing data to the application are referred to as the higher communication layers (HCL). The interface between LCL and HCL is referred to as communication service interface (CSIF).\nFor the assessment of the overall system performance, it is important to differentiate between the 3GPP network’s performance (i.e., including only the LCL and measured at the CSIF) and the overall system performance including the application layer (i.e., including both, the LCL and the HCL). In Figure C.5-1, the orange arrow depicts the vertical application’s point of view. The blue arrows indicate two options to measure the 3GPP network’s performance, i.e., including and excluding the IP layer.\n[Description of image generated by vision LM]\nFigure C.5-1: Network performance measurements at different communication system interfaces (CSIF)\nFigure C.5-2 illustrates how messages are transmitted from a source application device (e.g., a programmable logic controller) to a target application device (e.g. an industrial robot). The source application function (AF) is executed in the source operating system (OS) and hands over a message to the application layer interface of the source communication device. In the higher communication layers (HCL), which are not part of the 3GPP system, the data is processed. From the HCL the data is transferred to the lower communication layers (LCL), which are part of the 3GPP system. After transmission through the physical communication channel and the LCL of the target communication device, the data is passed to the HCL and lastly to the target application device. Characteristic parameters with respect to time are defined in Figure C.5-2.\nFrom 3GPP system point of view:\n-\tTransfer interval of 5G system: Time between the arrival of two pieces of data at the source CSIF.\n-\tEnd-to-end latency: Time measured from the point when a piece of data received at the CSIF in the source communication device until the same piece of data is passed to the CSIF in the target communication device.\nFrom vertical application point of view:\n-\tTransfer interval of vertical application: Time between the transmission of two successive pieces of data from the source application.\n-\tTransmission time: Time measured from the point when a piece of data is handed from the application layer interface of the source application device, until the same piece of data is received at the application layer interface of the target application device.\n-\tUpdate time: Time between the reception of two consecutive pieces of data at the application layer interface to the target application device.\nIf not stated otherwise, the terms \"end-to-end latency\" and \"transfer interval\" refer to the 3GPP system / 5G network parameters in this document.\n[Description of image generated by vision LM]\nFigure C.5-2: Relation between application device and communication device (downlink example).\n",

            "description": "The required synchronization precision is usually given as the maximum absolute value of the time difference between sync master and any device in the synchronisation domain (time domain or clock domain). A common example is a synchronisation precision of ≤ 1 µs. This is equivalent to ± the precision value, so ±1 µs between sync master and any device in the synchronisation domain, resulting in two times this value as maximum absolute time difference between any two devices in the synchronisation domain (2 µs in the example).\nAn industrial automation network generally consists of two distinct time domains.\nFirst is the global time domain. This is the time used for overall synchronization in the system (e.g. the factory). It is used to align operations and events chronologically. Industrial automation uses the term universal time domain [20] for the global time domain described in this document. Global time is known as a synonym for universal time in industrial automation. Global time is called wall clock in certain areas and standards.\nThe synchronization precision is typically ≤ 1µs [20]. In some areas, a precision of ≤ 100 µs might be sufficient for the global time domain if a working clock with precision of ≤ 1 µs is available. The assigned timescale is usually the International Atomic Time (TAI, temps atomique international), based on the precision time protocol (PTP) epoch (starting from 1 January 1970 00:00:00 TAI) [22]. While there is usually only one global time, multiple global time domains are possible.\nClock synchronization in the global time domain usually applies to all UEs within the industrial facility in industrial automation. That is, a global time domain covers usually the industrial facility.\nSecond is the working clock domain. Working clock domains are constrained in size. They often consist of a single machine or a set of neighbouring machines that physically collaborate. The restricted size allows very precise time synchronization (≤1µs) with efficient network components. Synchronisation to a working clock is used to align e.g. production lines, production cells, or machines/functional units. In these cases, the application synchronizes locally within the working clock domains (Figure D.1-1), allowing precise synchronization with more efficient components. A global time domain usually contains multiple working clock domains. The starting point (epoch) is the start of the working clock domain.\n[Description of image generated by vision LM]\nFigure D.1-1: Global time domain and working clock domains\nThe assigned timescale of a working clock domain is arbitrary (timescale ARB [22]). Therefore, different working clock domains may have different timescales and different synchronisation accuracy and precision. Robots, motion control applications, numeric control, and any kind of clocked / isochronous application rely on the timescale of the working clock domain to make sure that actions are precisely interwoven as needed.\nClock synchronization in the working clock domain is constraint in size. A specific working clock domain will contain only a subset of the UEs within the industrial facility. Often, the UEs of the working clock domain are connected to the same gNB. However, it is also possible that a working clock domain contains multiple neighbouring gNBs. This depends on the actual use case and its vertical application.\nDevices may be part of multiple time domains leading to overlapping working clock domains.\nThe required precision (usually ≤ 1 µs) is between the sync master and any sync devices of the clock domain, both, global time domain and working clock domain.\nClock domains might be called sync domains in certain areas and standards.\n",

The integration of 5G wireless communication into the industrial communication infrastructure allows for mobility in the manufacturing process. This mobility enhances flexibility in the manufacturing process, e.g. through adding certain manufacturing capabilities on-demand by having a machine move to the respective production line. This means that machines that are synchronized to different working clock domains may need to interact with each other.\nThe following scenario illustrates this. After the mobile machine has arrived at the intended location and is stationary again, the two interacting working clock domains have to be synchronized with each other. Otherwise interaction might not be possible without interfering with ongoing operations. An example is an autonomous mobile handling robot adding parts to an assembly line. Without synchronization between both, correct placement of the parts would be impossible.\nHowever, it is not feasible to schedule these interactions beforehand. Therefore, the interaction between different working clock domains requires a concept for handling the communication. TSN provides already mechanisms for this. The 5G systems and the UEs need to provide an interface in order to exchange information of the clock domain.\n[Description of image generated by vision LM]\nFigure D.2-1: Working clock domain interactions \"Merge\" and \"Separate\"\nWhen members of different working clock domains interact, there are two possible options (Figure D.2-1). Which option is used depends on the application and its requirements.\n-\tMerge: The working clock domains merge into one. This option can be used in applications where synchronization is critical, e.g. high precision robots interacting with each other.\n-\tSeparate: The members of the different working clock domains interact while keeping their own separate time synchronizations.

This differs drastically when compared to other multimedia services because the communication errors will be propagated to the entire audience that is consuming that content both live and recorded for later distribution. Furthermore, the transmitted data is often post-processed with nonlinear filters which could actually amplify defects that would be otherwise not noticed by humans. Therefore, these applications call for uncompressed or only slightly compressed data, and very low probability of errors. These devices will also be used alongside existing technologies which have a high level of performance and so any new technologies will need to match or improve upon the existing workflows to drive adoption of the technology.\nThe performance aspects that are covered by/in TS 22.263 [27] (Service requirements for Video, Imaging and Audio for professional applications) also target the latency that these services experience.\nIn recent years, production facilities have moved from bespoke unidirectional highly specialised networks to IP based systems and software-based workflows. This migration is expected to continue, and wireless IP connectivity is key to a number of these workflows.\nTypical set ups require multiple devices such as cameras, microphones and control surfaces that require extremely close synchronisation to maintain consistency of pictures and audio. Such clock synchronization requirements are captured in clause 5.6. Often devices need to communicate directly to each other for instance a camera to a monitor or a microphone to a PA system.\nVideo and audio applications also require extremely high quality of service metrics as the loss of a single packet can cause picture or sound breakup in the downstream processing or distribution.

Wired AV transmissions are Ethernet / IP based. Quality of service in AV IP networks is mainly achieved with IP DiffServ / DSCP based prioritization of packets in network switches.

                    "text_content": "Timing of multiple devices such as microphones and camera is also critical. Timing signals are used in 2 separate ways.\n-\tTo maintain synchronisation between devices so that electronic shutters on cameras operate at the same time and frequency and that when cutting between any two cameras pointed at the same source no discernible jumps can be seen. This requires accuracy within the frame boundary of a given video signal. A single frame of video at 120 Hz would require a clock accurate to within 8 ms.\n-\tTo timestamp an IP packet carrying a video or audio sample. Existing standards and workflows for AVPROD rely on IEEE 1588 PTP timing with a SMPTE media profile applied. This requires a clock accurate to within 1 µs\n\n\n[Description of image generated by vision LM]\nFigure E.3-1 Typical IP based timing set up for AVPROD\n\n\nAvailability and reliability are used both in 3GPP and vertical industries, but with different meanings. Communication service availability addresses the availability of a communication service. This definition follows the vertical standard IEC 61907 [7]. On the other hand, reliability is a 3GPP term and addresses the availability of a communication network. The relation of both terms is depicted in figure F-1 for a mobile network.\n[Description of image generated by vision LM]\nFigure F-1: Illustration of the concepts reliability and communication service availability.\nAs depicted, reliability covers the communication-related aspects between two nodes (here: end nodes), while communication service availability addresses the communication-related aspects between two communication service interfaces. This might seem to be a small difference, but this difference can lead to situations, where reliability and communication service availability have different values.\nExample: traffic gets \"stuck\"\nThe related scenario is depicted in figure F-2.\n[Description of image generated by vision LM]\nFigure F-2: Example in which reliability and communication service availability have different values. Packets are reliably transmitted from the communication service interface A to end node B, but they are not exposed at the communication service interface B.\nThis scenario addresses unicast communication from application A to B. The packets are handed over at the communication service interface A from the application to the communication network, and the packets are then transmitted to the end node B. In this example, the packets received by end node B are not exposed at the communication service interface B. So, even if all packets that are handed over to end node A are successfully delivered to end node B within the time constraint required by the targeted service (reliability = 100 %), the communication service availability is 0% since no packets arrive at the \"end\", namely the communication service interface B.\nExample: packets dropped at the communication service interface\nThe related scenario is depicted in figure F-3.\n[Description of image generated by vision LM]\nFigure F-3: Example in which reliability and communication service availability have different values. Only half of the packets handed over to the end node A are actually transmitted to end node B and then handed over to application B at the communication service interface B.\nThis scenario describes unicast communication of evenly interspersed packets from application A to B. The packets are handed over at the communication service interface A from the application to the communication network, and the packets are then transmitted to the end node B. However, only every second packet is actually successfully handed over to end node A and then transmitted to end node B. Thus, only half of the packets arrive at application B. Note though that the reliability of the mobile network is 100%, since all packets transmitted by end node A are delivered to end node B within the time constraint required by the targeted service. However, depending on the agreed QoS, the communication service availability can be of the same value as the reliability or much lower. For instance, if the agreed survival time is equal to or larger than the end-to-end latency, reliability and communication service availability are equal. However, if the survival time is smaller, the reliability is two times the communication service availability.\nNote that the shortest time interval over which the communication service availability should be calculated is the sum of maximum allowed end-to-end latency and survival time.\n\n\n",
